    "content": "Item 1. Business\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to we, our, us, F45, the Company, and our Company refer to Training Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we use certain key measures for determining how our business is performing. The below metrics are used throughout this Form 10-K and, unless otherwise indicated, all references to such metrics shall have the meanings ascribed to such metrics below:\nInitial Studio Openings refers to the number of and FS8 studios that were determined to be first opened during such period. Prior to October 1, 2021, we classified an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the first month in which the studio first generates monthly revenue of at least $4,500. From October 1, 2021, we classify an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the month in which we record the initial studio opening in our internal systems, in the studio customer management platform as having generated revenue or has a recorded opening date in the franchisee management platform (Internal Systems). Any studios that did not have an Initial Studio Opening under the prior definition are included as of October 1, 2021. Initial Studio Openings are not adjusted downward for studios that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\nNew Franchises Sold means, for any specific period, the number of franchises sold during such period using the methodology set forth below for Total Franchises Sold.\nOpen Studios means the number of studios that were recorded in our Internal Systems as open for business as of a certain date. A studio may be classified as an Open Studio regardless of whether or not it generated any monthly revenue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our network was forced to temporarily close, which reduced the number of Open Studios. Studios reopened in accordance with state and local regulations are reflected in the Open Studios figures. A studio will continue to show as open in our Internal Systems until a franchisee notifies us of its closure or the franchise agreement is terminated.\nSame Store Sales means, for any reporting period, studio-level revenue generated by a comparable base of franchise studios, which we define as Open Studios that have been operating for more than 16 months. Vive is excluded from Same Store Sales figures as they are corporate-owned studios.\nSystem-wide Sales are defined as all payments made to our studios and includes payment for classes, apparel and other sales for a given period. System-wide Sales include sales by franchisees that are not revenue recognized by us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). We track System-wide Sales as an indication of the scale and growth of our franchisee network. Vive is excluded from System-wide Sales.\nTotal Franchises Sold represents, as of any specified date, (i) the total number of signed and FS8 franchise agreements in place as of such date for which an establishment fee has been paid and (ii) the total number of franchises committed in a multi-studio agreement in place as of such date for which an upfront payment has been made, in each case that have not been terminated. Each new franchise is included in the number of Total Franchises Sold from the date on which such franchise first satisfies the condition in clause (i) or (ii) above, as applicable. Total Franchises Sold includes franchise arrangements in all stages of development after signing a franchise agreement, and includes franchises with Open Studios. Franchises are removed from Total Franchises Sold upon termination of the franchise agreement or multi-studio agreement.\nTotal Studios as of any specified date, means the total cumulative Initial Studio Openings as of that date less cumulative permanent studio closures as of that date. Permanent studio closures are studios in which we have executed a mutual termination or unilateral termination of the franchise agreements and whose operations have permanently ceased. Total Studios are not adjusted downward for studios that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or are associated with franchise agreements that have not been terminated.\nVisits means the number of registered individual workouts for any specified period. A workout is registered when a member or trial user checks into a class.\nAdditionally, this annual report contains estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business, our franchises and the markets for our products and services. Some data and statistical information are based on independent reports from third parties, including the International Health, Racquet & Sports Club Association (IHRSA). Some data and other information related to our franchisees, including estimated initial investment, EBITDA margins and average unit volumes (AUVs), are based on internal estimates and calculations that are derived from research we have conducted.\nWe are focused on creating a leading global fitness training and lifestyle brand. We primarily offer consumers functional 45-minute workouts that are effective, fun and community-driven. Our workouts combine elements of high-intensity interval, circuit and functional training to offer consumers what we believe is the worlds best functional training workout. We deliver our workouts primarily through our digitally-connected global network of studios, and we have built a differentiated, technology-enabled platform that allows us to create and distribute workouts to our global franchisee base. We offer consumers a continuously evolving fitness program in which virtually no two workouts are ever the same. Our library of functional training movements allows us to vary workout programs to keep consumers engaged with fresh content, stay at the forefront of consumer trends and drive maximum individual results.\nOur in-studio experience utilizes our proprietary technologies: our fitness programming algorithm and our technology-enabled delivery platform. Our fitness programming algorithm leverages a rich, growing content database of thousands of unique functional training movements across modalities to offer new workouts each day. Our content delivery platform allows us to standardize the Training experience across our global footprint and broadcast content, including workout instructions and timing, directly to our in-studio content delivery platform, orTV, and connected speaker systems. Our in-studio experience is further enhanced by coaches who provide guidance on proper form and movement, as well as motivate our members and foster a positive sense of community. We believe our approach helps to provide a consistent and high-quality fitness experience across our network of studios, keeping members highly engaged and helping them to achieve and sustain their fitness goals.\nWe operate a nearly 100% franchise model, apart from a small number of corporate-owned studios owned for franchisee transition or training purposes and three Vive studios, that offers compelling economics to us and our franchisees. We believe our franchisees generally benefit from a relatively low initial investment and low four-wall operating expenses, which allows them to generate strong profitability and returns on investment. The optimized box layout of our studios, which requires as little as approximately 1,600 square feet of training area, contributes to the relatively low initial investment and relatively low ongoing operating costs of our franchise model, and allows our studios to be located in a wide array of prospective retail locations. We estimate that a typical Training franchise in a normalized operating environment requires an aggregate initial investment of between approximately $221,700 and $846,600. We believe our franchise model is attractive due to its potential for asset-light growth, strong profitability and robust cash flow generation, and has helped to facilitate our rapid growth.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe there are several competitive strengths that form the foundation of our strategy and are key differentiating factors of our business.\nThe Next Generation Global Fitness Training and Lifestyle Brand Striving to Deliver the Worlds Best Workout\nOver the last ten years, we have focused on leveraging our differentiated approach to fitness to develop a global brand that is viewed as the gold standard in the fitness industry. We and our franchisees strive to offer our members the best functional training workout in each studio on a daily basis. Our differentiated, technology-driven approach, including our proprietary fitness programming database consisting of thousands of unique functional training movements across modalities, helps us to design workouts that are fun, challenging, safe, dynamic and sustainable for members to attend day after day\nand week after week. The versatility of our workouts resonates with both women and men, and across a broad range of fitness levels.\nInnovative and Differentiated Technology-Enabled Delivery Platform Driving Quality and Consistency within Each Studio\nA critical component to the success of our business is our technology that provides us with the ability to remotely manage each in-studio experience across our global studio network from our centralized technology systems at Training headquarters. We have built an automated, centralized delivery platform that gives us the ability to control the delivery and timing of our workout content through ourTVs in each of our studios. Our centralized delivery platform enables a seamless Training experience on a consistent basis at scale across a broad geographic footprint.\nHighly Scalable Commercial Delivery and Franchise Development Model\nOur differentiated approach, including our fitness programming algorithm and our proprietary technology-enabled delivery platform, plays an integral role in the scalability of our business. By integrating technology into the workout experience, we have been able to develop a franchise model that is highly replicable for both new and existing franchisees across multiple geographies. In addition, our purpose-built studio design, which utilizes an open floor plan and modest physical footprint, can be built within a wide array of prospective retail locations. We offer a simplified pre-opening process by providing franchisees with a comprehensive studio opening pack, called a World Pack, which includes the key items needed to operate the studio, including fitness equipment, technology, AV equipment and more.\nCompelling Franchisee Studio Economics\nWe believe we offer a compelling business opportunity for franchisees to generate strong returns driven by a relatively low initial investment combined with attractive AUVs and low four-wall operating expenses. We have designed our workout to take place in studio space that requires as little as 1,600 square feet, resulting in reduced rent expense, whileTVs provide video instructions to members allowing for reduced staffing requirements. We believe that a typical Training franchise in a normalized operating environment requires an aggregate initial investment of between approximately $221,700 and $846,600 in the U.S.\nPredictable, Asset-Light Model Driving Rapid Growth\nAs a franchisor, we have employed an economic model that, other than due to the unprecedented global shutdown of our network due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been predictable and asset light and has enabled us to open new studios at an accelerated pace compared to an owner-operator model. For the majority of franchises that we sell, we receive an upfront payment from the franchisee, which varies by geography. Once a new studio has opened, we expect to receive contractual, recurring monthly franchise fees that provide us with a high degree of revenue visibility. As our network of total studios grows, we expect recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue to increase.\nOur Growth Strategies\nWe believe there are several attractive opportunities to continue to drive the long-term growth of our business.\nExpand Studio Footprint in the United States\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to meaningfully expand our franchise studio footprint in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we had 882 Total Studios in the United States.\nExpand Studio Footprint Throughout the Rest of the World\nWe believe in the portability of our brand and franchise model, as evidenced by our growth outside of our core U.S. and Australian markets. We have designed our studios to be deployed successfully in both\ndeveloped and emerging markets, and to drive growth in both under penetrated and new markets. As of December 31, 2022, we had 826 Franchises Sold outside of our core markets of the United States and Australia.\nWe believe we can grow our international presence through our existing franchising strategy and by opportunistically pursuing master franchising agreements with experienced, local partners in order to accelerate growth in markets that we have yet to establish a presence or require additional resources to further our presence. We believe that master franchising in select international markets may help drive more rapid studio footprint expansion by leveraging the local area operating and business knowledge of experienced partners without incurring significant increases in our operating expenditures or corporate infrastructure costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had entered into two master franchise agreements: one in the UK and select European countries, and one in South Korea.\nGenerate Incremental Franchise Fee Revenue by Driving Growth in Same Store Sales and AUVs\nOur franchise agreements in the United States generally provide us with contractual monthly franchise fees equal to the greater of a fixed monthly fee or a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue, generally 7%. Additionally, we are working to transition franchise agreements outside of the United States to the greater of a fixed monthly fee or a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue model. We believe this model helps to align our interests with those of our franchisees while also providing us with the opportunity to participate in revenue upside as our franchisees grow studio AUVs.\nPursue Franchise Agreements with Multi-Unit Franchise Systems\nThe majority of our studios are owned by franchisees who are either owner-operators or investors that have more than one studio. Going forward, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop multi-unit franchise systems with select financial partners. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 67% of our Franchises Sold were owned by multi-unit franchisees, which highlights the strong market demand for multi-unit franchise opportunities. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 52% of Open Studios were owned by multi-unit franchisees.\nExpand Into New Channels\nWe believe there is an opportunity to expand into new channels, and we are actively pursuing potential opportunities to partner with major universities, hospitality operators, corporations and military facilities. In 2016, we believe we became the first external studio fitness provider to open a studio on a major U.S. university campus through our collaboration with the University of Southern California. As of December 31, 2022, we had 35 studios located on major university campuses in the United States, including Purdue University, Virginia Tech, Stanford University and the University of Texas at Austin. In 2022, we expanded our presence in the hospitality channel through the grand opening of an studio inside the Hilton Hotels and Resorts downtown property in Austin, Texas.\nDevelop New Concepts to Access Broader Demographic Groups\nWe believe there is an opportunity to create new concepts and workout programs that enable us to target a broader range of consumer demographic groups.\nWe recently developed a new fitness concept called FS8, which we began marketing in Australia in March 2021. FS8 integrates three popular methods in the health and fitness industry, the remixing of Pilates, yoga and tone, to create a new workout style. This workout style is an effective method of building lean muscle and definition. FS8 offers members a premium fitness experience throughs platform of training systems, the FS8TV and FS8 App, and also offers franchisees a proprietary business model and large community via the franchise network. We also have a dedicated support team to assist across all business functions. As of December 31, 2022, we had sold 128 total FS8 franchises, 121 in Australia, three in the USA, two in Asia, and two in Ireland. As of December 31, 2022, we had 44 total open FS8 studios, 41 in Australia, two in Asia, and one in England. As of December 31, 2022, FS8 studios continue to operate in a test phase and as a result we have not yet commenced charging monthly franchise fees.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced the acquisition of Vive Active (Vive), an Australian fitness company that offers reformer and mat Pilates workouts through in-studio, at-home streaming and on-demand classes. We plan to grow Vives footprint through franchised studios in select international markets. During 2022, we began franchising Vive, signing the first franchisee-owned studio in Singapore during the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had three corporate-owned Vive studios in Australia.\nOur Workouts\nFunctional Training Experience\nWe believe we offer the worlds best functional training workout. We combine elements of high intensity interval, circuit and functional training to offer our members an intense 45-minute workout consisting of natural real-world movements, such as lifting, squatting, jumping, twisting, kicking, rowing, cycling and other high intensity exercises. Our workouts utilize our proprietary, in-studio technology to allow members to walk through a series of exercise stations. In-studioTVs provide video instructions for each exercise, and our in-studio coaches, who are required to obtain a Certificate of Personal Training (CPT) and First Aid/AED certification, help guide members on proper form and movement. We believe that by designing highly innovative and effective total body workouts that minimize injury risk and allow for increased visit frequency, we provide our members with a fitness program that is well positioned to serve as the basis for achieving their long-term fitness goals.\nDynamic Fitness Programming\nOur fitness program consists of cardio, resistance and hybrid branded workouts. Our branded workouts are mapped on thirteen four-week cycles, with each cycle focusing on specific disciplines, exercise modalities, team-based workouts and more. This structure helps to ensure that each member experiences a differentiated and engaging workout. As new fitness trends arise, we are able to adapt our programming and cater to changing consumer preferences through the continuous evolution of our workouts, utilizing both new and existing content, and continuously innovate our branded workouts and functional training movement library.\nOnce the branded workout cycle is set, we employ an automated workout programming algorithm that scans and filters our database of thousands of unique functional training movements across modalities to select exercises based on each of the branded workouts defined key format of characteristics and configure a series of exercises within each workout. Our workout programming algorithm accounts for the following criteria, ensuring every routine is dynamic, sustainable and new:\nmovement and exercise types;\nmuscle groups;\ntype of equipment;\ncircuit rules and exercise frequency (avoiding repetition); and\nnumber of stations, sequencing and workout timelines.\nAfter the algorithm builds a workout cycle, these workouts are then vetted by the Athletics Department and its team of experienced training professionals to confirm quality, avoid duplication of targeted muscle groups or movements and provide for efficient transitions between stations and ultimately a progressive and balanced training program. The new cycle is finalized approximately four weeks ahead of its system-wide release after testing the new programming across several test studios for quality and ease of use by coaches and members to provide an organized and robust system.\nOur Studios\nStudio Layout and Design\nWe have designed our studios around the principles of functionality, simplicity and purpose. Each studio has an optimized footprint, with a minimum training area of as little as approximately 1,600 square feet, which enables our studios to be located in a wide array of prospective retail locations. We believe the flexible design and open floor plan layout of our studios positions us to be responsive to potential shifts in consumer preferences as new fitness trends emerge with different setup requirements.\nEach studio has standardized Training-branded fitness equipment and related technology, which includesTVs, spin bikes, dumbbells, kettlebells, sleds and more, all of which are included in our World Pack. The wall-mountedTVs are positioned throughout the studio to provide an illustrative, station-by-station guide for each workout and to serve as a reference point for members to visualize proper form and progress through each workout station. In-studio coaches provide additional support by helping members execute exercises with appropriate form and resistance level, while offering encouragement and motivation. To drive a welcoming, intimidation-free environment, we purposely exclude mirrors on the walls of our studios. Our standardized studio design helps ensure the consistency of the Training experience across our global network of studios.\nStudio Membership and Member Pricing\nWe provide franchisees with suggested pricing for workouts and membership options based on relevant market dynamics, but pricing is ultimately managed at the discretion of our franchisees. Franchisees typically offer multiple membership options, such as weekly memberships with unlimited workouts, monthly memberships with a limited number of workouts, workout packs that include a fixed number of workouts that can be used at any time, as well as single workout options. Franchisees may also offer other membership options, including longer-term memberships for a discounted rate and specific promotional membership plans. Many franchisees offer a limited free trial period to attract prospective new members. We do not offer multi-studio membership plans and memberships are not transferable across our studios.\nFranchise Model\nFranchise Agreement\nFor each franchise license, we enter into an agreement with the franchisee covering standard terms and conditions. We grant our franchisees an exclusive area or territory under the franchise agreement, and territories are determined as agreed with us using our internal analysis, after taking into account population density and demographics. The proposed location must be approved by us, and each franchisee is responsible for the acquisition or lease of the premises from which to operate the business within their respective territory. The franchise agreement requires that the franchisee operate the studio at a specific location.\nThe typical franchise agreement has an initial five-year term. We may refuse to extend the term of the agreement if the franchisee is in default under the franchise agreement or has failed to achieve minimum performance targets. More specifically, these minimum performance targets include a target that, within 12 months of opening, each franchisee must achieve an annual gross revenue of at least 70% of the average gross revenue of all franchisees who have been operating for at least 12 months. Within six months of the expiration of the initial five-year term, franchisees have the opportunity to renew for an additional five-year term, subject to the terms and conditions prevailing at the time of renewal.\nThe franchise agreement requires franchisees to comply with our standard methods of operation, which govern the provision of services, use of vendors and sale of merchandise. These provisions require that franchisees must generally purchase equipment from us and may only buy products, goods and materials approved by us. We may terminate the franchise agreement upon an event of default by the franchisee, and the franchisee may terminate only with our mutual consent.\nHistorically, franchisees have paid a fixed monthly franchise fee. Since July 2019, we transitioned our model in the United States for new franchisees to a franchise fee based on the greater of a fixed monthly franchise fee or a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue. In select markets outside of the United\nStates, and for renewals of existing franchisees in the United States, we are working to transition to a similar model. We believe this transition will continue to better align our growth strategy with those of our franchisees.\nIndustry Dynamics\nCompetition\nWe operate in a competitive and highly fragmented market, with multiple industry segments competing for the consumers share of wallet that is allocated to fitness and health. While we operate specifically in the studio fitness category, we consider the following key industry categories as competition:\nother studio fitness concepts;\nfull-service health clubs;\nracquet, tennis, country and other athletic clubs;\nvalue-focused health clubs; and\nat-home fitness offerings, including digital fitness content.\nThe number, size and strength of our competitors vary by region. Some of our competitors have national name recognition or an established presence in local markets, and some are established in markets in which we have existing studios or intend to locate new studios.\nWe believe that we compete on the basis of our flexible functional training workout, our Training experience, innovative and proprietary technology platform, compelling franchisee studio economics and our franchise development model. We believe we offer an attractive and flexible price point relative to personal training, while maintaining a competitive rate as compared to other studio fitness offerings.\nMarketing Strategy\nOur marketing strategy is focused on delivering the highest quality Training experience to franchisees and members of our studios and raising awareness of our brand through a broad range of channels. These channels include influencer, experiential, social media, online search, digital media, TV and print marketing. Marketing activity is conducted both by us and by our franchisees. We utilize a multi-prong marketing strategy focused on attracting and educating prospective franchisees, driving demand with new and existing members and increasing general awareness and affinity for our brand.\nBrand Marketing\nWe seek to drive brand awareness through marketing initiatives that highlight the differentiated Training experience and community. In August 2022, we launched the marketing brand fund, funded by our franchisees, within the United States which we believe will provide for continued growth in brand awareness throughout the United States. We believe the spend from our brand marketing will continue to grow as we increase Initial Studio Openings in the United States. Additionally, we anticipate launching similar marketing brand funds in other localities at some point in the future. We have created a curated training experience that is driven by technology and supported by community, which drives a powerful brand with broad demographic appeal and a highly passionate member base. Brand marketing is performed over a variety of methods, including social media marketing, earned media, local events, marketing partnerships, television, outdoor billboard, and pasting campaigns in key markets.\nFranchisee Sales Marketing\nOur primary methods for marketing to prospective franchisees include a mix of social, digital, search, referral and experiential marketing. We have created a scalable and sustainable marketing model through which we identify potential franchisees and pursue qualified leads utilizing our sales team.\nMembership Marketing\nOur membership marketing efforts, which are conducted both prior to studio opening and on an ongoing basis, focus on targeting the acquisition of new members and the retention of our existing members through local paid media, organic social, search and grassroots experiential marketing. Our membership marketing program consists of the following:\nPre-Opening Membership Marketing Campaigns: Pre-Opening campaigns are funded by franchisees, and are a mix of paid media, organic social media and grassroots marketing initiatives that are focused on building the studio membership base prior to opening. In these campaigns, our preferred paid digital media partners, local studio coaches, managers and owners drive awareness of, and excitement about, our brand through targeted social and search advertisements, organic social media channels efforts and grassroots marketing outreach to local businesses, charitable organizations and schools in the respective community.\nOngoing Membership Marketing Programming: Working in conjunction with selected preferred paid digital media partners for a monthly fee, we make available post-open monthly marketing campaigns that are designed to generate the leads that our franchisees can nurture over their trial period in order to convert them into new members. We seek to reach and engage with target audiences using geographic and demographic targeting across social and digital media platforms.\nOne-on-One Marketing Support: In addition to the paid membership marketing programming, we provide significant value to franchisees alongside our preferred paid digital media partners, offering paid media, organic social, search and grassroots marketing support at the studio-level.\nIntellectual Property\nThe protection of our intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. Our standard form of employment agreement includes confidentiality provisions and invention or work product assignment provisions with our employees to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held 57 registered trademarks in the United States, including our logo and logo components, and had 11 U.S. trademark applications pending. As of December 31, 2022, we also held 309 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions and had 77 trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence of and ability to patent new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.\nWe license the use of our marks to franchisees, third-party vendors and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements and licensing agreements. These agreements generally restrict third parties activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements. We generally require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.\nWe register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on legal and contractual protections of our copyrighted works that have been fixed in a tangible medium or otherwise qualify for copyright protection. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.\nInformation Technology & Systems\nAll studios use a computerized, third-party hosted store management system to process new in-store memberships, bill members, update member information, check-in members and process point of sale transactions. Our websites are hosted by third parties, and we also rely on third-party vendors for related functions such as our system for processing and integrating new online memberships, updating member information and making online payments. We use these third-party vendors to gather data from our\nfranchisees, including information on franchisee performance and operations. We believe these systems are scalable to support our growth plans.\nOur back-office computer systems are comprised of a variety of software designed to assist in the management and analysis of our franchisee revenue and key operational metrics as well as support the daily operations of our headquarters. These include third-party hosted systems that assist with onboarding franchisees in accordance with standards, a third-party hosted financial system for reporting, advanced analysis and which helps to facilitate financial analysis and forecasting and a third-party hosted payroll system.\nWe also provide our franchisees access to a web-based, third-party hosted custom franchise management system to receive informational notices, operational resources and updates, training materials and other franchisee communications.\nIn relation to our workouts, we utilize a fitness programming algorithm that intelligently selects exercises from a database of thousands of unique functional training movements across modalities. This algorithm produces potential workout plans which are then centrally reviewed and staged by our head coaches before ultimately being distributed to studios.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations affecting our business including those that concern franchise operations, payment processing, consumer protection, information and data privacy and other laws regarding unfair or deceptive trade practices.\nWe are subject to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Franchise Rule promulgated by the FTC that regulates the offer and sale of franchises in the United States and its territories (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) and requires us to provide to all prospective franchisees certain mandatory disclosures in a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). In addition, we are subject to state franchise sales laws in approximately 14 states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to make filings and obtain franchise registration prior to our making any offer or sale of a franchise in those states and to provide an FDD to prospective franchisees in accordance with applicable franchise laws and regulations. We are also subject to franchise relationship laws in approximately 18 states that regulate several aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the applicable law and venue in which franchise disputes must be resolved, discrimination, franchisees right to associate and sourcing, among others.\nWe are subject to franchise disclosure laws in six provinces in Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario and Prince Edward Island) that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to provide an FDD in a format prescribed by such laws to prospective franchisees in accordance with such laws, and that may regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship.\nWe are subject to franchise disclosure and relationship laws in Australia that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us to provide an FDD in a format prescribed by such laws to prospective franchisees and that regulate certain aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the venue in which franchise disputes must be resolved, franchisees right to associate and the use of marketing funds.\nIn addition, we and our franchisees may also be subject to laws in other foreign countries where we or they do business, including franchise disclosure, registration and relationship (and similar) laws and regulations. For example, we are also subject to franchise registration and disclosure laws in other countries in which we operate, including but not limited to Australia, Canada, China, France, French Polynesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Caledonia, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Taiwan and the United States, that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us, unless otherwise exempt, to register an FDD in a prescribed format and to provide that FDD to prospective franchisees, in accordance with such laws, and that regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship.\nWe and our franchisees are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, similar state laws in certain jurisdictions, and various other laws in the United States, Canada, Australia and other foreign jurisdictions governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions.\nOur and our franchisees operations and properties are subject to extensive federal, international, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building and zoning requirements. Our and our franchisees development of properties depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.\nWe and our franchisees are responsible at the studios we each operate for compliance with state laws that regulate the relationship between health clubs and their members. Nearly all states have consumer protection regulations that limit the collection of monthly membership dues prior to opening, require certain disclosures of pricing information, mandate the maximum length of contracts and cooling off periods for members (after the purchase of a membership), set escrow and bond requirements for health clubs, govern member rights in the event of a member relocation or disability, provide for specific member rights when a health club closes or relocates, or preclude automatic membership renewals. We and our franchisees primarily accept payments for our memberships through electronic fund transfers from members bank accounts, and, therefore, we and our franchisees are subject to both federal and state legislation and certification requirements, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Some states, such as New York, Massachusetts and Tennessee, and countries, such as Australia, have passed or have considered legislation requiring health clubs to offer a prepaid membership option at all times and/or limit the duration for which health club memberships can auto-renew through EFT payments, if at all. Our business relies heavily on the fact that our memberships continue on a month to month basis after the completion of any initial term requirements, and compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. States that have such health club statutes provide harsh penalties for violations, including membership contracts being void or voidable.\nAdditionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our, or our franchisees, businesses are regulated at the federal, state and provincial levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry, Security Standards Council, the National Automated Clearing House Association, and the Canadian Payments Association. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time to time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to our businesses and may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our databases.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nOn July 26, 2022, as a result of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and in order to best position the Company to achieve sustained growth over the near and long-term, we announced the initiation of a reduction in force of approximately 110 employees.\nAs of December 31, 2022, after the reduction in force, we employed 17 employees in Australia, 95 employees in the United States and 1 employee in the United Kingdom. We also leverage external service providers to support U.S. operations. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.\nTraining franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees are not our employees.\nWe believe that an engaged, diverse, and inclusive culture is essential for the success of our business, and we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success. As such, our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The growth and development of our workforce is an integral part of our success. Another critical component of maintaining our engaged and inclusive culture is making investments in our team members at all levels\nwith our training programs. We are also committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion and know that a companys ultimate success is directly linked to its ability to identify and hire talented individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives.\nFacilities\nWe do not own any real property. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas. We occupy an office space of approximately 44,000 square feet in our global headquarters. Our lease for our headquarters expires June 2029. We have one option to extend the lease for five additional years. We also have approximately 22,500 square feet of office and warehouse space in West Palm Beach, Florida that the company is working to sublease. The lease for this space expires February 2033.\nSuppliers\nWe source substantially all of the gym equipment provided in our World Pack from a single supplier in China who manufactures products in its own facilities. Our vendor typically manufactures and holds the inventory until franchisees orders are fulfilled. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company began storing inventory at third-party storage facilities based on expected customer demand. We also source additional equipment and products from suppliers in the United States and Canada and use local distributors for certain gym equipment. Franchisees generally purchase equipment through our approved suppliers or must seek written approval for non-approved suppliers. Approved suppliers are those who demonstrate the ability to meet our standards, who possess adequate quality controls and the capacity to supply franchisees needs promptly and reliably, whom we have approved in writing and whom we have not later disapproved. We may change the number of approved suppliers at any time and may designate ourselves, an affiliate, or a third party as the exclusive source for any particular item.\nCorporate\nOur corporate headquarters address is 3601 South Congress Avenue, Building E, Austin, Texas, 78704.

Information included or referred to on, or otherwise accessible through, our website is not deemed to form a part of, or be incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently, and from time to time may become, involved in legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, employment disputes and commercial contract disputes. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty and except for those matters discussed below, we are not currently a party to any litigation or regulatory proceeding that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn December 2022, plaintiff Kenzie Geor filed a purported class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against us, Chris Payne, Adam Gilchrist, Michael Raymond, Darren Richman, and Mark Wahlberg. The complaint purported to allege securities class action claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and challenged as misleading statements regarding our business model in our registration statement issued in connection with our initial public offering in July 2021. In February 2023, Judge Robert Pitman appointed Pledge Capital to act as lead plaintiff and its counsel, Labaton Sucharow LLP, to act as lead counsel. In May 2023, lead plaintiff and an additional named plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding as defendants investors Kennedy Lewis Management LLC (KLIM) and MWIG LLC (MWIG). The amended complaint again challenges as false or misleading statements abouts business model in the registration statement. It also adds claims under Section 12(a) of the Securities Act against the underwriters fors IPO. Finally, the amended complaint adds claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act against, and Messrs. Gilchrist and\nPayne and under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Messrs. Gilchrist, Payne, Raymond, Richman, and Wahlberg, KLIM, and MWIG as control persons. The Exchange Act claims challenge the same statements in the IPO registration statement and also challenge later statements to investors regarding the Companys business model, plans, and results. The purported class period is from July 15, 2021 through July 22, 2022. On August 7, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Pursuant to the briefing schedule that motion is expected to be fully briefed in November 2023. The Company intends to zealously defend against the allegations.\nOn October 19, 2022, DB Ventures Limited and ABG-Shark LLC filed a complaint (Case No. 22STCV33846) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, against Training Holdings, Inc., alleging breach of contract in connection with certain promotional agreements with David Beckham and Greg Norman, respectively, and seeking damages of no less than $20 million. In April 2023, ABG-Shark LLC refiled its claim as a separate matter from DB Ventures Limited in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles (Case No. 22StCV33846) alleging breach of contract in connection with a promotional agreement with Greg Norman and seeking damages of no less than $1.75 million. DB Ventures Limited vs. Training, Inc. was removed from the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles to the United States District Court Central District of California in May 2023 (Case No. 2:23-cv-03460-MEFM) alleging breach of contract in connection with a promotional agreement with David Beckham and seeking damages of no less than $18.85 million. The Company disputes these claims and intends to vigorously defend itself. The litigation is preliminary in nature and involves substantial uncertainties. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOn July 1, 2019, we received a letter from Universal Music Group, or UMG, alleging copyright infringement and licensing violations in connection with our distribution of music to our franchisees. On March 8, 2023, the Company resolved this matter, which included receiving mutual releases of the parties.\nIn December 2020, plaintiff Kerttu Karon filed a purported class action complaint (Case No. 20STCV49535) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against Training Incorporated. The complaint purported to allege claims relating to violations of certain wage and employment laws in connection with the use of models for half and full day photo shoots and is seeking compensatory damages, restitution, liquidated damages, punitive damages, specific performance, penalties and interest. In April 2021, plaintiff amended this complaint to allege violations under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA). In August 2021, plaintiff amended this complaint to include Karim Benzakour as a plaintiff. The company disputes these claims and intends to vigorously defend itself. The litigation is in the discovery phase and involves substantial uncertainties. Therefore, there can be no assurance that such legal proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions or cash flows.\nIn October 2022, the company was notified by the State of Michigan Department of the Attorney General regarding an investigation concerning alleged violations of the Michigan Franchise Investment Law. In August 2023, the company entered into a Settlement Agreement with the Michigan Department of Attorney General in connection with an investigation of certain violations of the Michigan Franchise Investment Law. The company did not admit to any liability and agreed to pay a penalty of $95,000 and offer rescission to eight franchisees who purchased a franchise in the State of Michigan.\nIn September 2021, the company was notified by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation regarding an investigation concerning alleged violations of the Franchise Investment Law. In October 2023, the company entered into a Consent Order with the State of California Commission of Financial Protection and Innovation in connection with an investigation of certain violations of the Franchise Investment Law. The company did not admit to any liability and agreed to pay a penalty of $152,500 and offer rescission to 35 franchisees in the State of California who purchased a franchise in the State of California on or before September 2019. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks, events and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become material factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose part or all of your investment in our common stock.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Operating in the Health Club and Fitness Industry\nIf we are unable to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences and shifting views of health and fitness and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated fitness services, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe high level of competition in the health club and fitness industry, including on-demand fitness, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on consumer discretionary spending, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends.\nRisks Related to Our Franchisee Business Model and Strategy\nOur financial results are affected by the number of Franchises Sold and studios we open and by the operating and financial results of such studios\nIf we fail to identify, recruit and contract with qualified franchisees, our ability to open new franchised studios and increase our revenue could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to renew our franchise agreements with our existing franchisees, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe success of our business strategy depends on our ability to effectively manage and support our franchise system.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes new studio development by existing and new franchisees, our brand and ability to increase our revenue and operating profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we and our franchisees are unable to identify and secure suitable sites for new franchise studios, our revenue growth rate and operating profits may be negatively impacted.\nOur franchisees may incur rising costs related to construction of new studios and maintenance of existing studios, which could materially and adversely affect the attractiveness of our franchise model, and in turn our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our establishment fees, World Pack and franchise fees, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to various franchise laws and regulations, and changes in such laws and regulations, or failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations and other legal developments that impact franchising, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\nUncertainty in the law with respect to the assignment of liabilities in the franchise business model could adversely impact our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Brand and Strategy\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brand. Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur marketing strategy relies on the use of social media platforms and any negative publicity on such social media platforms may adversely affect the public perception of our brand which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition and the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, our use of social media could subject us to fines or other penalties.\nOur ability to continue to expand our ancillary product offerings is uncertain and the new business lines are subject to risks.\nOur investments in new business strategies, including new brand launches, may have adverse effects on our operating results.\nThe ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, or another pandemic or epidemic, and related governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread have had, and in the future may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music to supplement our workouts and workout tutorials. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we or our franchisees do not hold necessary music licenses may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and may lead to third party claims or lawsuits.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the brand and our business.\nRisks Related to Technology and Privacy\nWe and our franchisees rely heavily on information systems, and any material failure, interruption or weakness in these systems may prevent us from effectively operating our business and damage our reputation.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships and reputation, all of which could harm our brand and our business.\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\nRisks Related to Our Suppliers and Supply Chain\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for equipment and certain products and services could result in disruptions to our business and could materially and adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.\nIncreases in tariffs and trade restrictions on equipment we source from China could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, History of Losses and Negative Cash Flow\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow, or income to satisfy our debt service obligations and financial covenants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nOur obligations to the holders of our Senior Credit Agreement and Subordinated Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. If we default on those obligations, the holders of such indebtedness could foreclose on our assets.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe liquidity of our shares of common stock will likely be adversely affected by our delisting from the NYSE and our anticipated deregistration from the Securities and Exchange Commission and our ability to raise capital could be significantly impaired.\nOur current major stockholders have significant control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters subject to stockholder approval, including a change of control.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operations\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our profitability and international growth prospects.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nGeneral Risks\nWe have identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses is not effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.\nOur business faces various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur management team has experienced significant turnover and we may not be able to retain an experienced management team.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Operating in the Health Club and Fitness Industry\nIf we are unable to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences and shifting views of health and fitness and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated fitness services, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe fitness industry is highly susceptible to changes in consumer preferences. Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. If we are unable to introduce new services and products in a timely manner, or before our competitors do, or our new services and products are not accepted by our customers, our growth and profitability could be negatively affected. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower membership and utilization rates. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality health and fitness services. Our failure to effectively introduce new health and fitness services that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in revenue. In addition, developments or shifts in research or public opinion on the types of workouts and products we provide could negatively impact our business. Failure to predict and respond to changes in public opinion, public research and consumer preferences could materially and adversely impact our business.\nThe high level of competition in the health club and fitness industry could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market, with multiple industry segments competing for consumers share of the wallet allocated to fitness spend. While we operate specifically within the studio fitness category, we consider companies in the following key industry segments as potential competition: other studio fitness concepts; full-service health clubs; racquet, tennis, country and other athletic clubs; value-focused health clubs; and at-home fitness offerings, including digital fitness content. We also compete for qualified franchisees, management, fitness training professionals and other personnel. Our franchisees also compete for qualified fitness coaches. We may not be able to compete effectively in the regions in which we currently operate or those in which we may operate in the future. Competitors may attempt to copy our business model, or portions thereof, which could erode our market share and brand recognition and impair our growth rate and profitability. Competitors, including companies that are larger and have greater resources than us, may compete with us to attract members and qualified fitness coaches in our regions. Other studio fitness concepts may lower their prices or create lower-priced brand alternatives within our markets. Furthermore, due to the increased number of low-cost studio fitness alternatives, we\nmay face increased competition if our membership pricing increases or if discretionary spending declines. In addition, as we expand into new markets, we may face competitive challenges penetrating those markets due to, among other factors, competitors who may already have a significant presence in those markets, consumer unfamiliarity with our brand and our own unfamiliarity with the health and fitness market in such regions. Current and future competition may limit our and our franchisees ability to attract new members and retain existing members, may limit our ability to attract and retain new and existing franchisees and may hinder our franchisees ability to attract and retain qualified fitness coaches, which in each case could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continued growth of on-demand fitness classes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAt home on-demand fitness classes offer the benefit of a user-selected workout at home where users have the ability to vary the types of workouts they do on a daily basis, if desired. Many on-demand fitness classes can also be live streamed, allowing real-time interactions, including coaching cues from the class instructor. As the availability and variety of on-demand fitness classes (including live streaming classes) continue to grow, our members preferences may shift away from the in-studio experience, which is central to our business model, to at-home on-demand classes. Millennials, who represent one of the largest, most active demographic groups, in particular, may exhibit a shift in preference to on-demand fitness classes as they enter new life phases, such as parenthood, and, as a result, find new constraints placed on their free time. As such, on-demand workouts may become better suited for their lifestyles. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of and demand for at-home fitness classes, which may extend beyond the pandemic. If we fail to timely identify and effectively respond to any such shift in consumer preference, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on consumer discretionary spending, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends.\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Some of the factors that may negatively influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth, declines in asset values and related market uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future of the political and economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as memberships and workout packs at our studios, generally decline during periods of economic uncertainty, when disposable income is reduced or when there is a reduction in consumer confidence. If consumer purchases of memberships and workout packs at our studios decline, our franchise fee revenue may be adversely affected. In addition, during an economic downturn, existing franchisees may elect not to renew their franchise agreements with us, and prospective franchisees may opt not to enter into a franchise agreement with us, each of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our franchisees may be unable to attract and retain members, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends on our and our franchisees ability to attract and retain members. Our and our franchisees marketing efforts may not be successful in attracting members to studios, and membership levels may materially decline over time, especially at studios in operation for an extended period of time. Members may cancel their memberships at any time after giving proper advance written notice, subject to an initial minimum term applicable to certain memberships. Our franchisees may also cancel or suspend memberships if a member fails to provide payment for an extended period of time. In addition, we experience attrition and we and our franchisees must continually engage existing members and attract new members in order to maintain membership levels. It is possible that a portion of our member base may not regularly use our studios and may cancel their memberships. Some of the factors that could lead to a decline in membership levels include, among other factors:\nchanging desires and behaviors of consumers or their perception of our brand;\ngovernment shutdowns, social distancing requirements, stay at home orders and advisories or any other restrictions or suggestions adopted my governmental authorities;\nchanges in discretionary spending trends;\nmarket maturity or saturation;\na decline in our ability to deliver quality service at a competitive price;\na failure to introduce new features, products or services that members find engaging;\nthe introduction of new products or services, or changes to existing products and services, that are not favorably received;\ntechnical or other problems that affect the member experience;\nan increase in monthly membership dues due to inflation;\ndirect and indirect competition in our industry;\na decline in the publics interest in health and fitness; and\na general deterioration of economic conditions or a change in consumer spending preferences or buying trends.\nIn order to increase membership levels, our franchisees may from time to time offer promotions or lower monthly dues or annual fees. If our franchisees are not successful in optimizing pricing or finding other ways to add memberships in new and existing studios, our membership levels may decrease, and in turn growth in monthly membership dues or annual fees may suffer, which will have an increasing impact on our financial results as we continue to move to a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue based franchise fee model. Any decrease in our average dues or fees or higher membership costs may materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, further expansion into international markets may create new challenges in attracting and retaining members that we may not successfully address, as these markets carry unique risks as discussed below. As a result of these factors, we cannot be certain that our membership levels will be adequate to maintain or permit the expansion of our operations. A decline in membership levels would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Franchisee Business Model and Strategy\nOur financial results are affected by the number of Franchises Sold and studios we open and by the operating and financial results of such studios, which impact will become more significant as we continue to implement a variable franchise fee structure.\nUnder the terms of our franchise agreements, each of our franchisees is required to pay us an establishment fee upon signing a new franchise agreement, and monthly franchise and related fees throughout the term of the franchise agreement. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from such fees. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we derived 69.7% and 58.9% of our revenue, respectively, from Franchise revenue. As a result, our financial results depend on the number of Franchises Sold and number of studios. If we are unable to sell new franchises that eventually open studios, or renew existing franchise agreements, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nPrior to July 2019, our monthly franchise fees were generally a flat monthly fee. Since then, we have transitioned our model in the United States for new franchisees to a franchise fee based on the greater of a fixed monthly franchise fee or a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue. In select markets outside of the United States, and for renewals of existing franchisees in the United States, we are in the process of developing a strategy for transitioning to a similar model. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing this model with new franchisees or in transitioning existing franchisees to this model in our markets. We anticipate that monthly franchise fee payments by our franchisees, whether in the form of a flat fee or variable fee, will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue in the future. Accordingly, we are reliant on the performance of our franchisees in successfully operating their studios and generating sufficient revenue to enable them to pay monthly franchise fees and other fees to us on a timely basis. If our franchisees are not successful in operating their studios, they may not be able to pay required monthly franchise fees to us, which could harm our operating results through reduced franchise fee revenue. As we continue to implement the variable franchise fee structure, our financial\nresults will become even more dependent on the operational and financial results of our franchisees. Further, such shift in franchise fee structure will likely result in greater variability in our results from year to year and from quarter to quarter because our franchise fee revenue will be directly impacted by the sales performance of our franchisees. As a result, as this structure continues to be implemented, we expect period-to-period comparisons of our operating results to be less reliable as an indication of our performance for any future period.\nIf we fail to identify, recruit and contract with qualified franchisees, our ability to open new franchised studios and increase our revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe opening of additional franchised studios depends, in part, upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our criteria. We may not be able to identify, recruit or contract with suitable franchisees in our target markets on a timely basis or at all. Although we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective franchisees, our franchisees may not ultimately have the business acumen or be able to access the financial or management resources that they need to open and successfully operate the studios contemplated by their franchise agreements with us. Franchisees may elect to cease studio development for other reasons, including applicable franchise laws that may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise agreements. If we are unable to recruit suitable franchisees or if franchisees are unable or unwilling to open new studios as planned, our growth may be slower than anticipated, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have begun entering into long-term multi-unit studio agreements with individual parties. These agreements provide for a large number of studios to be open on a set schedule and be operated by a single party. If that party does not perform or is unable to open and operate the studios as anticipated, it could materially and adversely affect our planned openings of new studios and expected revenue from the studios.\nIf we are unable to renew our franchise agreements with our existing franchisees, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and results of operations depend on maintaining franchise agreements with our existing franchisees. Our typical franchise agreement has an initial five-year term. Upon the expiration of the initial term, we or the franchisee may, or may not, elect to renew the franchise agreement. Whether or not a franchise agreement is renewed is contingent on:\nthe franchisees execution of the then-current form of franchise agreement, which may include increased or different franchise fee revenue, marketing fees and other fees and costs;\nthe satisfaction of certain conditions, including re-equipment and remodeling of the studio and other requirements;\nthe payment of a renewal fee; and\nother conditions which are outside our control, including those that impact our franchisees, such as economic conditions, their financial situation, the success of their studio, their other commitments and their ability to renew their studio lease on acceptable terms or to find a suitable alternative location.\nOur franchisees ability to negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms on leases with renewal options, or conversely for a suitable alternative location, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our franchisees relationships with current and prospective landlords or may depend on other factors that are not within our or our franchisees control. As of December 31, 2022, the initial franchise term in 381 franchise studios will expire during 2023 and 591 franchise studios are operating under expired franchise agreements. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 approximately 288 franchisees studios were not operating, but had not terminated their franchise agreements. If we are unable to renew our franchise agreements in respect of such studios or a significant portion thereof, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe timing of the opening of Franchises Sold may differ materially from historical experience, and the number of new franchised studios that actually open in the future may differ materially from\nthe number of signed commitments we currently have or anticipate from existing and new franchisees.\nAs of December 31, 2022, a significant number of Franchises Sold did not yet have operating studios. The timing of the opening of each new studio is subject to many factors outside of our control, including those discussed below in We have grown rapidly in recent years and have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes new studio development by existing and new franchisees, our brand and ability to increase our revenue and operating profits could be materially and adversely affected, and accordingly the timing of the opening of new studios may differ materially from historical experience. Further, as we continue to expand our business into new international markets, the risks our franchisees may face in such markets, such as political and economic instability, local laws and regulations and inadequate brand infrastructure, may result in longer periods for opening new studios.\nA portion of our Franchises Sold may not ultimately open as new franchised studios. Approximately 0.8% and 1.0% of the Franchises Sold at the beginning of the period in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, were subsequently terminated. Additionally, approximately 530 Franchises Sold during the year ended December 31, 2022 were subsequently terminated during the year ended December 31, 2022. The historic conversion rate of signed commitments to new franchised studios may not be indicative of the conversion rates we will experience in the future and the total number of new studios actually opened in the future may differ materially from the number of signed commitments disclosed at any point in time. Additionally, Total Franchises Sold includes 913 franchises sold under development agreements which have development schedule timelines providing for openings of studios through 2028. Failure of the franchisees to adhere to the timeline of required development schedules provided within the development agreements may result in many of these studios not ultimately opening. At December 31, 2022, three development agreements, representing approximately 518 or 14% of Total Franchises Sold, were not in compliance with their development schedule timelines. To the extent our franchisees, including those under development agreements, are unable to open new studios as we anticipate, we will not realize the revenue growth that we expect. Our failure to add a significant number of new studios would adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue and income from operations.\nWe have limited control with respect to the operations of our franchisees, which could have a negative impact on our business, and our franchisees are impacted by factors that are beyond our control.\nFranchisees are independent business operators and are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of their studios. We provide training and support to franchisees, and set and monitor operational standards, but the quality of franchised studios may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Franchisees may not successfully operate studios in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, including those relating to our marketing strategy, applicable laws or regulations, or may not hire and train qualified coaches and other personnel. Further, we cannot be certain that our franchisees will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to operate successful franchises in their approved locations. Applicable state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify franchise agreements with non-complying or unsuccessful franchisees. If franchisees do not operate to our expectations or if consumers have negative perceptions or experiences with our franchised studios, our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially and system-wide membership could decline significantly, which could reduce our franchise fees and other revenue.\nAs small business owners, some of our franchisees may be negatively and disproportionately impacted by capital requirements, negative economic conditions, including pandemics, recession, inflation and increased unemployment levels, or other issues. Furthermore, franchisees business obligations may not be limited to the operation of our studios, making them subject to business and financial risks unrelated to the operation of our studios. These unrelated risks, and the effect of decreased consumer confidence or changes in consumer behavior, could materially harm our franchisees financial condition, which would cause our franchise fees and other revenue to decline and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result.\nMoreover, disputes with franchisees could damage our brand image and reputation and our relationships with our franchisees, generally.\nThe success of our business strategy depends on our ability to effectively manage and support our franchise system.\nWe operate a nearly 100% franchise model. As such, the success of our business strategy depends on our franchise network, which requires ongoing support and oversight from us, including comprehensive training on membership marketing and day-to-day operations, business support systems, marketing support, management information systems and support with other systems and procedures. Failure to provide our franchisees with adequate training, support and resources could materially and adversely affect both our new and existing franchisees, as well as cause disputes between us and our franchisees. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent years and have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes new studio development by existing and new franchisees, our brand and ability to increase our revenue and operating profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. In less than ten years, we have scaled our global footprint to 3,663 Total Franchises Sold in 74 countries, including 2,100 Total Studios as of December 31, 2022. Our growth strategy relies substantially upon new studio openings by existing and new franchisees, and we are continuously seeking to identify target markets where we can enter or expand, taking into account numerous factors such as the location of our current studios, demographics and traffic patterns. Our franchisees face many challenges in opening new studios, including:\navailability and cost of financing;\nselection and availability of suitable studio locations;\ncompetition for studio sites;\nnegotiation of acceptable lease and financing terms;\navailability of financing, including the impact of rising interest rates;\nsecuring required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals, including zoning approvals;\nhealth and fitness trends in new geographic regions and acceptance of our offerings;\nemployment, training and retention of qualified personnel in local markets;\nability to open new studios during the timeframes we and our franchisees expect;\nthe general legal and regulatory landscape in which their studios operate;\nactual or perceived threats to public health due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\ndetermining and setting appropriate membership fees to ensure the success of their studios; and\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nIn particular, because new studio development is funded entirely by franchisee investment, our growth strategy is dependent on our franchisees (or prospective franchisees) ability to access funds to finance such development. Franchisees of new studios may have difficulty securing adequate financing, particularly in new markets, where there may be a lack of adequate history and brand familiarity. If our franchisees or prospective franchisees are not able to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the development of new studios, and our future growth could be materially and adversely affected. For example, in May 2022, the Company entered into a $150 million credit agreement (the New Facility) with Fortress Credit Group for the purpose of providing financing to franchisees. However, the New Facility was terminated on August 14, 2022, prior to providing any financing to franchisees as a result of the Company no longer maintaining compliance with covenants requiring minimum market capitalization thresholds.\nIn addition, our franchisees ability to successfully open and operate new studios in new or existing markets may be adversely affected by a lack of awareness or acceptance of our brand, as well as a lack\nof existing marketing efforts and operational execution in these new markets. To the extent that we are unable to implement effective marketing and promotional programs and foster recognition and affinity for our brand in new markets, our franchisees new studios may not perform as expected, and our growth may be significantly delayed or impaired. In addition, new studios may not be successful or our average studio membership sales may not increase at historical rates, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we and our franchisees are unable to identify and secure suitable sites for new franchise studios, our revenue growth rate and operating profits may be negatively impacted.\nTo successfully expand our business, we, along with our franchisees, must identify and secure sites for new franchise studios that meet our established criteria. In addition to finding sites with the right demographic and other measures we employ in our selection process, we also evaluate the penetration of our competitors in the market. We and our franchisees face significant competition for sites that meet our criteria, and as a result we and our franchisees may lose those sites, our competitors could copy our format or our franchisees could be forced to pay significantly higher lease payments for those sites. If we and our franchisees are unable to identify and secure sites for new studios in suitable locations, our revenue growth rate and operating profits may be negatively impacted. Additionally, if our or our franchisees analysis of the suitability of a studio site is incorrect, our franchisees may not be able to recover the capital investment in developing and building the new studio and in turn may not be able to pay required royalties to us.\nAs we increase our number of studios, our franchisees may also open studios in higher-cost geographies, which could entail greater lease payments and construction costs, among others. The higher level of invested capital at these studios may require higher operating margins and higher net income per studio to produce the level of return our franchisees and potential franchisees expect. Failure to provide this level of return could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOpening new studios in close proximity may negatively impact our existing studios revenue and profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 3,663 Total Franchises Sold in 74 countries, and we plan to open many new studios in the future, some of which will be in existing markets. We intend to continue opening new franchise studios in our existing markets as part of our growth strategy, some of which may be located in close proximity to studios already in those markets. Opening new studios in close proximity to existing studios may attract some memberships away from those existing studios, which may lead to diminished revenue and profitability for us and our franchisees rather than increased market share, especially as we continue to move to a percentage of gross monthly studio revenue-based franchise fee model. In addition, as a result of new studios opening in existing markets and because older studios will represent an increasing proportion of our studio base over time, our Same Store Sales increases may be lower in future periods than they have been historically.\nOur franchisees may incur rising costs related to construction of new studios and maintenance of existing studios, which could materially and adversely affect the attractiveness of our franchise model, and in turn our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur studios require both upfront and ongoing investments, including periodic remodeling and equipment replacement. If our franchisees costs are greater than expected, franchisees may not achieve their expected targeted return. In addition, increased costs may result in lower profits to the franchisees, which may cause them to terminate their franchise agreement or make it harder for us to attract new franchisees, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if a franchisee is unwilling or unable to acquire the necessary financing to invest in the maintenance and upkeep of its studios, including periodic remodeling and replacement of equipment, the quality of its studios could deteriorate, which may have a negative impact on our brand image and our\nability to attract and maintain members, which in turn may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our establishment fees, World Pack and franchise fees, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our establishment fees, World Pack and franchise fees, whether due to competitive pressure or otherwise, our revenue and operating profit could be significantly reduced. Further, our decisions around the development of new ancillary products and services are grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company provided limited time offers of World Packs at reduced prices as compared to initially agreed upon contractual terms. If these limited time offers are made in the future, or if there is price compression in the market after these decisions are made, it could have a negative effect on our business.\nIf our relations with existing or potential franchisees deteriorate, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur growth depends on maintaining good relations with our franchisees. Franchisees, as independent business operators, may from time to time disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business or our interpretation of our respective rights and obligations under our franchise agreements, including with respect to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements. Disagreement may lead to disputes with our franchisees, and we expect such disputes to occur from time to time. Disputes between us and our franchisees, whether in court or otherwise, could relate to either partys violation of its contractual obligations. We may also engage in litigation with franchisees to enforce the terms of our franchise agreements and compliance with our brand standards as we determine necessary to protect our brand, the consistency of our studios and the customer experience or to enforce our contractual indemnification rights if we are brought into a matter involving a third party due to the franchisees alleged acts or omissions. In addition, we may be subject to claims by our franchisees relating to our FDD, including claims based on financial information contained in our FDD.\nFurthermore, existing and future franchise-related legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we terminate or fail to renew a franchise relationship. Unfavorable judgments or settlements relating to franchisee disputes could result in monetary or injunctive relief against us, including the voiding of non-compete, territorial exclusivity or other development-related provisions upon which we rely. Any negative outcome in such disputes could materially and adversely affect our results of operations as well as our ability to expand our franchise system and may damage our reputation and brand. To the extent that we have disputes with our franchisees, the attention, time and financial resources of our management and our franchisees will be diverted from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even our success in franchisee disputes could damage our franchisees finances or operations, or our relationships with them or our ability to attract new franchisees.\nOur business is subject to various franchise laws and regulations, and changes in such laws and regulations, or failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, and other legal developments that impact franchising could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs a franchised business, we are subject to the FTC Franchise Rule, which is a trade regulation imposed on franchising promulgated by the FTC that regulates the offer and sale of franchises in the United States and that requires us to provide to all prospective franchisees certain mandatory disclosure in an FDD. In addition, we are subject to state franchise registration and disclosure laws in a number of states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us, unless otherwise exempt, to register our franchise offering in those states prior to our making any offer or sale of a franchise in those states and to provide an FDD to prospective franchisees in accordance with such laws. States requiring franchise registration include, but are not limited to, California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Hawaii and Washington. We are also subject to franchise registration and disclosure laws in other countries in which we operate, including Australia, Canada, China, France, French Polynesia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, New Caledonia, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and the United States, that regulate the offer and sale of franchises by requiring us, unless otherwise exempt, to register a franchise disclosure\ndocument in a prescribed format and to provide that franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees, in accordance with such laws, and that regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship.\nFurther, FTC Franchise Rule requires the FDD to include updated audited financial statements for the previous completed fiscal year to be compliant. As a result of the delay in our ability to provide audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we have not been able to update our FDDs for sales purposes during 2023. Therefore, we have not been able to sell any franchises in the United States in 2023 since April 2023 and will not be able to commence sales until the filing of our 2023 FDDs.\nWe are currently subject to similar laws in other countries in which we currently offer franchises, and we may also become subject to laws in additional countries in the future. We are not currently, and in the past we have not been, in compliance with certain applicable franchise registration and disclosure laws in certain jurisdictions. Further, as we expand into new markets outside of our more significant markets of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore, we may have limited knowledge of local franchise laws and regulations and may take time to apprise ourselves of such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable franchise registration and disclosure laws may result in being prohibited from selling in that geography, a franchisees right to rescind its franchise agreement and damages, pursuant to the terms of its franchise agreement, and may result in investigations or actions from federal, state or local franchise authorities, civil fines or penalties and stop orders, among other remedies.\nWe are also subject to franchise relationship laws in a number of jurisdictions that regulate many aspects of the franchise relationship including, depending upon the jurisdiction, renewals and terminations of franchise agreements, franchise transfers, the applicable law and venue in which franchise disputes may be resolved, discrimination and franchisees right to associate, among others. Our failure to comply with such franchise relationship laws could result in fines, damages and our inability to enforce franchise agreements where we have violated such laws. Any non-compliance on our part could result in liability to franchisees and regulatory authorities, inability to enforce our franchise agreements and a reduction in our anticipated franchise fee revenue, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe and our franchisees are also subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and various other laws in the United States, Canada, Australia and other foreign jurisdictions governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions. A number of our franchisees employees may be paid at rates related to the U.S. federal or state minimum wage, and the U.S. federal and/or state minimum wage may increase. Any increases in labor costs might result in our franchisees inadequately staffing studios. In addition, such increases in labor costs and other changes in labor laws could affect studio performance and quality of service, decrease franchise fee revenue and adversely affect our brand.\nWe and our franchisees operations and properties are subject to extensive federal, international, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building and zoning requirements. Failure to comply with these legal requirements could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe and our franchisees are responsible for compliance with applicable laws that regulate the relationship between studios and their members. Many jurisdictions have consumer protection regulations that may limit the collection of membership dues or fees prior to opening, require certain disclosures of pricing information, mandate the maximum length of contracts and cooling off periods for members (after the purchase of a membership), set escrow and bond requirements for studios, govern member rights in the event of a member relocation or disability, provide for specific member rights when a studio closes or relocates, or preclude automatic membership renewals. Our franchisees failure to comply fully with these rules or requirements may subject us or our franchisees to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, or result in membership contracts being void or voidable. In addition, any changes to such laws or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate cause us to change or limit our business practices, which may make our business model less attractive to our franchisees or our members.\nOur investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.\nOur long-term business objectives depend on the successful system-wide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization in order to transform the customer experience, including modernization of our mobile applications, introduction of new equipment within our studios, and addition of new group based training formats. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our franchise model and strengthening relationships with both franchisee and customers which may not generate the expected results. If these initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.\nUncertainty in the law with respect to the assignment of liabilities in the franchise business model could adversely impact our profitability.\nOne of the legal foundations fundamental to the franchise business model has been that, absent special circumstances, a franchisor is generally not responsible for the acts, omissions, or liabilities of its franchisees, whether with respect to the franchisees employees or otherwise. In the last several years, this principle has been the subject of differing and inconsistent interpretations at the National Labor Relations Board and in the courts, and the question of whether a franchisor can be held liable for the actions or liabilities of a franchisee under a vicarious liability theory, sometimes called joint employer, has become highly fact dependent and generally uncertain. A determination that we are a joint employer with our franchisees or that our franchisees are part of one unified system subject to joint and several liability could subject us and/or our franchisees to liability for employment-related and other liabilities of our franchisees and could cause us to incur other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions, including Australia, we may be liable if our franchisees fail to comply with employment and work health safety legislation. Any finding that we are liable for such non-compliance could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees.\nOur franchise business model subjects us to all of the risks described above and a number of other risks, any one of which may impact our franchise fee revenue collected from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand and may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additional risks include the following:\nFranchisee litigation; effects of regulatory efforts\nWe and our franchisees are subject to a variety of litigation risks, including, but not limited to, member claims, personal injury or wrongful death claims, vicarious liability claims, litigation with or involving our relationship with franchisees, litigation alleging that the franchisees are our employees or that we are the co-employer of our franchisees employees, employee allegations against the franchisee or us of improper termination, sexual harassment or hostile work environment allegations, discrimination or employee classification, landlord/tenant disputes and intellectual property claims, among others. Each of these claims may increase costs, reduce the execution of new franchise agreements and affect the scope and terms of insurance or indemnifications we and our franchisees may have.\nIn addition, we and our franchisees are subject to various regulatory efforts to enforce employment laws, such as efforts to categorize franchisors as the co-employers of their franchisees employees, legislation to categorize individual franchised businesses as large employers for the purposes of various employment benefits, and other legislation or regulations that may have a disproportionate impact on franchisors and/or franchised businesses. Any of these changes could impose greater costs and regulatory burdens on franchising and negatively affect our ability to sell new franchises.\nFranchisee insurance\nOur franchise agreements require each franchisee to maintain certain insurance types and levels of coverage. Losses arising from certain extraordinary hazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks, or franchisees may fail to procure the required insurance. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on a franchisees ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise agreement or other contractual obligations, which could cause a franchisee to terminate its franchise agreement and, in turn, negatively affect our operating and financial results.\nFranchise agreements and franchisee relationships\nOur franchisees develop and operate their studios under terms set forth in our franchise agreements. These agreements give rise to long-term relationships that involve a complex set of mutual obligations and mutual cooperation. We have a standard agreement that we typically use with our franchisees, but various franchisees have negotiated specific terms in these agreements. Furthermore, we may from time to time negotiate terms of our franchise agreements with individual franchisees or groups of franchisees. We seek to have positive relationships with our franchisees, based in part on our common understanding of our mutual rights and obligations under our agreements, to enable both the franchisees business and our business to be successful. However, we and our franchisees may not always maintain a positive relationship or always interpret our agreements in the same way. Our failure to have positive relationships with our franchisees could individually or in the aggregate (including as a result of franchisees forming an independent association of franchisees) cause us to change or limit our business practices, which may make our business model less attractive to our franchisees or our members.\nWhile revenue from franchisees are not concentrated among one party or a small number of parties, the success of our business does depend in large part on our ability to maintain contractual relationships with franchisees in profitable studios. A typical franchise agreement has a five-year term. As of December 31, 2022, our largest franchisee group accounted for approximately 9.5% of our Total Franchisees Sold. If we fail to maintain or renew our contractual relationships on acceptable terms, or if one or more of these significant franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unwilling to pay amounts due to us, our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFranchise agreement termination\nEach franchise agreement is subject to termination by us, as the franchisor, in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although, under certain circumstances, a franchise agreement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise agreements are drafted broadly to provide that we may terminate the agreement in the event of a breach. Such breach may include, among other things, any failure by the franchisee to meet operating standards and franchisee actions that may threaten the licensed intellectual property. In some regions in which we operate, a franchisee may have a right to terminate its franchise agreement under certain circumstances.\nFranchisee turnover\nThere can be no guarantee of the retention in the future of any franchisees, including the top performing franchisees, or that we will maintain the ability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber. The quality of existing franchisee operations may be diminished by factors beyond our control, including franchisees failure or inability to hire or retain qualified managers and other personnel, increased competition, rising operating costs, supply chain interruptions, increasing regulatory and legal complexity, and other factors. The training of managers and other personnel may be inadequate. These and other such negative factors could materially and adversely affect our business.\nBankruptcy of franchisees\nA franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect payments due under such franchisees franchise agreement(s). In a franchisee bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise agreement(s), development area(s) and/or franchisee lease/sublease pursuant to Section 365 under the U.S. bankruptcy code or similar laws in other countries, in which case there would be no further franchise fee payments from such franchisee, and we may not ultimately recover those payments in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection.\nFranchisee changes in control\nOur franchises are operated by independent business owners. Although we have the right to approve franchise owners, and any transferees, it can be difficult to predict in advance whether a particular franchise owner will be successful. If an individual franchise owner is unable to successfully establish, manage and operate the studio, the performance and quality of service of the studio could be adversely affected, which could reduce memberships and negatively affect our franchise fee revenue and brand image. Although our agreements prohibit changes in control of a franchisee without our prior consent as the franchisor, a franchise owner may desire to transfer a studio to a transferee franchisee. In addition, our franchise agreements in several regions, including the United States, provide that in the event of the death or disability of a franchisee (if a natural person) or a principal of a franchisee entity, the executors and representatives of the franchisee are required to transfer the relevant franchise agreements to a successor franchisee approved by the franchisor. In any transfer situation, the transferee may not be able to perform the former franchisees obligations under the franchise agreement and successfully operate the applicable studio. In such a case, the performance and quality of service of such studio could be adversely affected, which could also reduce memberships and negatively affect our franchise fee revenue and brand image.\nSome of our franchisees are operating entities\nFranchisees may be natural persons or legal entities. Our franchisees that are operating companies (as opposed to limited purpose entities) are subject to business, credit, financial and other risks, which may be unrelated to the operation of their studios. These unrelated risks could materially and adversely affect a franchisee that is an operating company and its ability to service its members and maintain studio operations while making franchise fee payments, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Brand and Strategy\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brand. Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, including our studio members connection to our brand. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Our reliance on social media as a marketing strategy makes us particularly susceptible to widespread negative publicity.\nIncidents which could damage our brand may relate to our policies, the way we manage our relationships with our franchisees, our growth strategies, our development efforts or the ordinary course of our or our franchisees businesses. Other incidents that could be damaging to our brand may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control, such as:\nactions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health (including responses to pandemics and endemics), safety, welfare or otherwise;\ndata security breaches or fraudulent activities associated with our and our franchisees electronic payment systems;\nlitigation and legal claims;\nthird-party misappropriation, dilution or infringement or other violation of our intellectual property;\nillegal activity targeted at us or others; or\nconduct by individuals affiliated with us which could violate ethical standards or otherwise harm the reputation of our brand.\nConsumer demand for our studios and our brands value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our studios, which would likely result in fewer memberships sold or renewed. If studio memberships decline, prospective franchisees may not open new studios, existing franchisees may not renew their franchise agreements and studio sales may decline, all of which would lower franchise fee revenue, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur marketing strategy relies on the use of social media platforms and any negative publicity on such social media platforms may adversely affect the public perception of our brand which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, our use of social media could subject us to fines or other penalties.\nWe rely on social media marketing, through Instagram, YouTube and Facebook, as a means to engage with our existing members as well as attract new members. Existing and new members alike interact with the brand both organically, through posts by the Training community, as well as through dedicated Training social media accounts. While the use of social media platforms allows us access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, our use of, and reliance on, social media as a key marketing tool exposes us to significant risk of widespread negative publicity. Social media users generally have the ability to post information to social media platforms without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning us or our brand may be posted on such platforms at any time. Such information may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which can harm our reputation and the value of our brand. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nIn addition, social media platforms provide users with access to such a broad audience that collective action against our studios, such as boycotts, can be more easily organized. If such actions were organized, we could suffer reputational damage as well as physical damage to our studios. Social media platforms may be used to attack us, our information security systems and our reputation, including through use of spam, spyware, ransomware, phishing and social engineering, viruses, worms, malware, distributed denial of service attacks, password attacks, Man in the Middle attacks, cybersquatting, impersonation of employees or officers, abuse of comments and message boards, fake reviews, doxing and swatting. As such, the dissemination of information on social media platforms and other online platforms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of the informations accuracy.\nIn addition, our use of social media platforms as a marketing tool could also subject us to fines or other penalties. As laws and regulations, including those from the FTC, and enforcement rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms, the failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms could materially and adversely impact our and our franchisees business, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nOur ability to continue to expand our ancillary product offerings is uncertain and new business lines are subject to risks.\nWe currently plan to continue the long-term growth of our business by, in part, capitalizing on member engagement by enhancing our offering of health and fitness related-related products, such as footwear and apparel, prepared meal plans, nutrition and supplements, and wearables, such as the LionHeart Heart Rate Monitor, across our global network of studios. Because all of these offerings are currently in the planning stages or relatively new, it is difficult for us to anticipate the level of sales they may generate.\nFurther, the market for such products is highly saturated and subject to consumer preferences, which may change from time to time. Certain product offerings, like prepared meals, nutrition and supplements, are also subject to unique risks like contamination and food-borne illnesses and require certain food safety programs and compliance with food and health regulatory regimes. Such risks and added compliance could have a material impact on our business. There is no guarantee that our members will embrace our expanded ancillary product offerings or that we will be able to execute this growth strategy.\nOur investments in new business strategies, including new brand launches, may have adverse effects on our operating results.\nWe have invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, including new modalities and channels such as FS8 and Vive. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. New ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful, as was the case with our Malibu Crew and Avalon House concepts. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company began the wind down of Malibu Crew and Avalon House concepts which the Company is no longer pursuing.\nThe ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, or another pandemic or epidemic, and related governmental restrictions intended to prevent its spread have had, and in the future may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated the global outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, a pandemic. The global and domestic response to the COVID-19 pandemic by both governments and businesses has been unprecedented and may continue to evolve. Many countries,\nincluding the United States and Australia, declared national emergencies and implemented preventive measures.\nOur business has been materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global response and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in consumer and business behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the initial and in subsequent peaks of the pandemic, nearly all of our studios closed due to COVID-19. Subsequent to studio re-openings, in some locations resurgences of the pandemic led some state and local governments to return to stricter regulations on businesses, resulting in certain studios that reopened to re-close and additional studios may again be closed in the future, pursuant to such local regulations. These restrictions had a material adverse effect on the number of studios open as well as pending and future sales to franchisees. Additionally, shutdowns resulted in an increase to studio build-out time delaying certain studio opening timelines. Certain governments required, and may in the future require, stringent guidelines with respect to the operation of fitness studios, including a reduced number of class participants, increased spacing requirements between participants and restrictions on sharing gym equipment. These requirements and any associated compliance costs have had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our operations, including our franchisees ability to retain members. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions have had significant impacts on consumer and business behavior.\nCOVID-19 has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Revenue\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our revenue in a number of respects. Throughout the pandemic, some franchisees were unable to pay the required monthly franchise fees due to the temporary closure of studios, and as a result, our franchise fee revenue was negatively impacted. In addition, due to temporary\nstudio closures, we did not realize the anticipated benefits from our variable franchise fee structure due to the operational and financial results of our franchisees being adversely impacted by the pandemic.\nRisks Related to Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related shelter-in-place restrictions and other containment efforts have had a significant impact on our operations, including mandated studio closures, stringent guidelines with respect to the operation of our studios, including reduced number of class participants, increased spacing requirements between participants and restrictions on sharing gym equipment. Many of our studios are located within central business districts which have been impacted by changes to return to office requirements as a result of the growth in telework. These requirements and any associated compliance costs have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations, including our franchisees ability to retain members.\nRisks Related to Growth\nOur growth has been and may continue to be harmed by COVID-19. A number of franchisees may elect to cease studio development due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, due to COVID-19, our studios experienced membership declines.\nRisks Related to Consumer and Business Behavior\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions have had and may continue to have a significant impact on both consumer and business behavior. We believe that these changes to consumer and business\nbehavior may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing restrictions and government mandates. In particular, we cannot predict if and when workers will return to working full-time in offices in major urban areas.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music to supplement our workouts and workout tutorials. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we or our franchisees do not hold necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use music to supplement our workouts. To secure the rights to use music to supplement our workouts and workout tutorials, we or our franchisees generally must obtain licenses from rights holders such as record labels, music publishers, performing rights organizations, collecting societies, artists and other copyright owners or their agents.\nThe process of obtaining licenses involves identifying and negotiating with many rights holders, some of whom are unknown or difficult to identify, and implicates a myriad of complex and evolving legal issues across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when and whether particular licenses are needed and by whom. Rights holders also may attempt to take advantage of their market power to seek onerous financial terms from us. Our relationship with certain rights holders may deteriorate. Artists and/or artist groups may object and may exert public or private pressure on rights holders to discontinue or to modify license terms. Additionally, there is a risk that aspiring rights holders, their agents, or legislative or regulatory bodies will create or attempt to create new rights that could require us to enter into new license agreements with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights holders, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify.\nWe require our franchisees to secure certain music licenses to use music in our studios and to supplement our workouts. Any failure to secure such licenses or to comply with the terms and\nconditions of such licenses may lead to third party claims or lawsuits and/or have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe or our franchisees generally need to obtain public performance licenses for the use of musical compositions in our studios and to supplement our workouts. In the United States, public performance rights for musical compositions are secured from music publishers, individual artists, or, more typically, through intermediaries known as performing rights organizations (PROs) which (a) issue blanket licenses to copyright users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory, (b) collect royalties under those licenses, and (c) distribute such royalties to copyright owners. We require our franchisees to enter into and maintain requisite licenses for their use of musical compositions with our workouts from the appropriate PROs. We currently do not maintain such licenses. The royalty rates available from PROs today may not be available in the future. Licenses provided by two PROs, ASCAP and BMI, currently are governed by consent decrees, which were agreements between each of the two PROs, on the one hand, and by the U.S. Department of Justice, on the other hand, in an effort to curb anti-competitive conduct. Removal of, or changes to the terms or interpretation of, these agreements, could affect our franchisees ability to obtain licenses from these PROs on current and/or otherwise favorable terms, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, licenses with PROs and collecting societies may not provide full coverage for performance of all of the musical compositions which we use in our studios in the countries in which we operate or which we may operate in the future. Some publishers, songwriters and other rights holders choose not to be represented by PROs or collecting societies, adversely affecting our ability to secure licensing arrangements for musical compositions that such rights holders own or control.\nIn addition to public performance licenses, we generally may need to obtain additional music licenses in connection with the musical \u2018daily mixes that we share with our franchisees. Any failure to obtain such licenses or to comply with the terms and conditions of such licenses may lead to third party claims or lawsuits and/or have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to the licenses secured by our franchisees, we generally may need to obtain additional licenses from rights holders of musical compositions and sound recordings, which may include individual artists, record labels, PROs and/or music publishers and administrators. We note that we cannot compel any such rights holders to license their music to us, and the licenses we are able to obtain may not cover every right that we need. We also note that identifying all rights holders for a given musical work can be challenging and, given the high level of content concentration in the music industry, the market power of a few licensors and the lack of transparent ownership information for compositions and sound recordings, we may be unable to license a large amount of music or the music of certain popular artists, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor example, we have previously received demands alleging possible infringement of certain compositions and recordings from owners of certain music rights. In addition, we had previously received demands from global performance rights organizations.\nAlthough we seek to comply with the statutory, regulatory and judicial frameworks with respect to the use of music in our studios and to supplement our workouts and workout tutorials, we cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees currently hold, or will always hold, every necessary right to use all of the music that is used in connection with our workouts and workout tutorials, and we cannot assure you that neither we nor our franchisees are infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights or that we or our franchisees will not do so in the future.\nThese challenges, and others concerning the use of music in connection with our workouts and workout tutorials, may subject us to significant music royalty payments and significant liability for copyright infringement, breach of contract or other claims, which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property rights, trademarks and trade names may be infringed, misappropriated or challenged by others.\nOur brand and related intellectual property are important to our continued success, which depends on our ability to use our existing trademarks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks and trade names to protect our brand. We seek to protect our trademarks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property by exercising our rights under applicable state, provincial, federal and international laws. Policing unauthorized use and other violations of our intellectual property rights is difficult and the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violations of our intellectual property. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights for any reason, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any damage to our reputation could cause membership levels to decline or make it more difficult to attract new members.\nWe may also from time to time be required to initiate litigation to enforce our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property. Third parties may also assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which could lead to litigation against us. Litigation is inherently uncertain and could divert the attention of management, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and negatively affect our membership sales and profitability regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce or defend our rights.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the brand and our business.\nIt may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.\nWe cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we produce, license and distribute through our content delivery platform.\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we produce, license and distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our studios and workouts, including marketing materials. We may decide to remove content from our workouts, not to place certain content in our studios, or to discontinue or alter our production of certain types of content if we believe such content might not be well received by our members or could be damaging to our brand and business.\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our studios, or if we become liable for content we produce, license or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types, and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims, which may materially and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Technology and Privacy\nWe and our franchisees rely heavily on information systems, and any material failure, interruption or weakness may prevent us from effectively operating our business and damage our reputation.\nWe and our franchisees increasingly rely on information systems, including our technology-enabled platform through which we distribute workouts to our global franchisee base, point-of-sale processing systems and other information systems managed by third parties, to interact with our franchisees and members, book workouts and collect, maintain and store member information, billing information and other personally identifiable information, including for the operation of studios, collection of cash, legal and regulatory compliance, management of our supply chain, accounting, staffing, payment of obligations, ACH transactions, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our and our franchisees ability to efficiently and effectively manage our respective businesses depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems, and any potential failure of third parties to provide quality uninterrupted service is beyond our control.\nOur and our franchisees operations depend upon our ability, and the ability of our franchisees and third-party service providers (as well as their third-party service providers), to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, denial-of-service attacks and other disruptions. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, stemming from maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, expanding our systems as we grow, a breach in security or other unanticipated problems, could result in interruptions to or delays in our business and member service and reduce efficiency in our operations. In addition, the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions, operational delays due to the learning curve associated with using a new system, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. If our information systems, or those of our franchisees and third-party service providers (as well as their third-party service providers), fail and our or our partners third-party back-up or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, our revenue and profits could be reduced, and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we or our franchisees fail to properly maintain the confidentiality and integrity of our data, our reputation and business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our franchisees transmit and collect studio member and employee data, including home address, gender, dates of birth and other highly sensitive personally identifiable information in information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by franchisees and third parties with whom we contract to provide services. We also collect personal member information through the use of our LionHeart heart rate monitors. Some of these data are sensitive and could be an attractive target of a criminal attack by malicious third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including lone wolves, organized criminal groups, hacktivists, disgruntled current or former employees and others. The integrity and protection of member and employee data are critical to us.\nDespite the security measures we have in place to comply with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our franchisees and third-party service providers (as well as their\nthird-party service providers), may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism or sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, loss or corruption of data or programming or human errors or other similar events. Furthermore, the size and complexity of our information systems, and those of our franchisees and our third-party vendors (as well as their third-party service providers), make such systems potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, franchisees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Because such attacks are increasing in sophistication and change frequently in nature, we, our franchisees and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these attacks or implement adequate preventative measures, and any compromise of our systems, or those of our franchisees and third-party vendors (as well as their third-party service providers), may not be discovered and remediated promptly. Changes in consumer behavior following a security breach or perceived security breach, act of cyber terrorism or sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer virus, loss or corruption of data or programming or human error or\nother similar event affecting a competitor, large retailer or financial institution may materially and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, the handling of personally identifiable information by our or our franchisees businesses is regulated at the federal, state and international levels. Federal, state and international agencies may also consider and implement from time to time new privacy and security requirements that apply to our businesses. Compliance with contractual obligations and evolving privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models and the development of new administrative processes. They also may impose further restrictions on our handling of personally identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our or our franchisees databases, or those of our third-party service providers. Actual or perceived noncompliance with privacy laws or an actual or perceived security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal, sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our franchisees or vendors, could have material adverse effects on our and our franchisees business, operations, brand, reputation and financial condition, including decreased revenue, material fines and penalties, litigation, increased financial processing fees, compensatory, statutory, punitive or other damages, adverse actions against our licenses to do business and injunctive relief by court or consent order. Despite our efforts, the handling of personally identifiable information may not be in compliance with applicable law, or this information could be disclosed or lost due to a hacking event or unauthorized access to our information system, or through publication or improper disclosure, any of which could affect the value of our brand.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships and reputation, all of which could harm our brand and our business.\nWe could be subject to a cyber-incident or other adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources, including intentional attacks or unintentional events where parties gain unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees. A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. The three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber-incident include operational interruption, damage to the relationship with members and franchisees and private data exposure, which each in turn could create additional risks and exposure.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our franchisees transmit and collect personally identifiable data regarding our members. We also maintain important internal company data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. As privacy and information security laws and regulations and contractual obligations with third parties evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations and contractual obligations. If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could materially and adversely affect our reputation and could disrupt our operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties arising from violations of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations.\nUnder certain laws, regulations and contractual obligations, a cyber-incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups of the incident or could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, or an increase in fees payable to third parties. We could also incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could materially and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We currently do not maintain any cyber security insurance coverages.\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\nWe and our franchisees use third parties to process payments from our members for our products and services. In addition, we use third parties to process payments from our franchisees. To the extent there are disruptions in the payment processing systems that we and our franchisees use, such as delays in receiving payments from payment processors, or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Further, if the third party processors we and our franchisees use become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our or their behalf, we and our franchisees would have to find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and, if not adequately controlled and managed, could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.\nSome of our products and services contain open-source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies, products and services in a manner that could harm our business.\nWe use open-source software in our products and services and anticipate using open-source software in the future. Some open-source software licenses require those who distribute open-source software as part of their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or to make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of many open-source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open-source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or services. Additionally, we could face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open-source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require us to expend significant additional research and development resources, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful.\nAdditionally, the use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is typically no support available for open-source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open-source software will implement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of the risks associated with the use of open-source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our developers for the use of open-source software, but we cannot be sure that all open-source software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our products and services. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Suppliers and Supply Chain Management\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for equipment and certain products and services could result in disruptions to our business and could materially and adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.\nEquipment and certain products and services used in our studios, including our exercise equipment, components of our tech packs and point-of-sale software and hardware, are sourced from and stored by third-party suppliers. We purchase substantially all of our gym equipment from a single supplier in China and we use a single logistics company to coordinate the storage of all equipment. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers to manage and maintain our websites and online membership processes. Although we believe that adequate substitutes are currently available, we depend on these third-party suppliers to\noperate our business efficiently and consistently meet our business requirements. The ability of these third-party suppliers and logistics providers to successfully provide reliable and high-quality supplies and services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control, including, for our overseas suppliers, vessel availability, port delays or congestion, and access to warehousing. Any disruption to our suppliers operations could impact our supply chain and our ability to service our existing studios, ship our products and open new studios on time or at all and thereby generate revenue. If we lose such suppliers or logistic providers or these parties encounter financial hardships unrelated to the demand for our equipment or other products or services, we may not be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms, if at all, or access equipment stored in warehouses. Transitioning to new suppliers would be time consuming and expensive and may result in interruptions in our operations. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the quantity of equipment we or our franchisees require to open new and refurbish existing studios, our suppliers encounter difficulties meeting our and our franchisees demands for products or services, our websites experience delays or become impaired due to errors in the third-party technology or there is a deficiency, lack or poor quality of products or services provided, or there is damage to the value of one or more of our vendors brands, our ability to serve our members and grow our brand would be interrupted. If any of these events occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIncreases in tariffs and trade restrictions on equipment we source from China could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe purchase substantially all of our gym equipment from a single supplier in China. Since the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain goods and materials. For example, in 2018 and 2019, the United States imposed significant tariffs on various products imported from China, including certain products we source from China. These tariffs are currently being reviewed by the Office of the United States Trade Representative as part of the standard four-year review process. The United States has also stated that further tariffs may be imposed on additional products imported from China if a trade agreement is not reached. On January 15, 2020, a phase one trade deal was signed between the United States and China and was accompanied by a decision from the United States to cancel a plan to increase tariffs on an additional list of products from China. However, given the limited scope of the phase one agreement, concerns over the stability of bilateral trade relations remain. At this time, there is no assurance that a broader trade agreement will be successfully negotiated between the United States and China to reduce or eliminate the existing tariffs. If additional tariffs are imposed on our gym equipment and equipment included in our World Packs, or other retaliatory trade measures are taken, our costs could increase and we may be required to raise our prices, which could materially and adversely affect our results. Increases in the cost of our gym equipment, including that included in our World Packs, could have a material effect on our gross margins as we may not be able to pass such costs onto our franchisees. In addition, if trade tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate, we may experience delays or disruptions in the delivery of our gym equipment to our franchisees, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers and logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks, including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.\nWe have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers and logistics partners, which subjects us to risks, such as the following:\ninability to satisfy demand for our World Pack products or other products or services that we currently offer in studios or may offer in the future;\nreduced control over delivery timing, as well as product reliability;\nreduced ability to monitor the manufacturing process and components used in our World Pack products and other products;\nlimited ability to develop comprehensive manufacturing specifications that take into account any materials shortages or substitutions;\nvariance in the manufacturing capability of our third-party manufacturers;\nprice increases;\nfailure of a significant supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner to perform its obligations to us for technical, market or other reasons;\ndifficulties in establishing additional supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner relationships if we experience difficulties with our existing suppliers, manufacturers or logistics partners;\nshortages of materials or components;\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property;\nexposure to natural catastrophes, political unrest, terrorism, labor disputes and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our World Pack products and other products are manufactured or the components thereof are sourced;\nchanges in local economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our suppliers, manufacturers and logistics partners are located;\nthe imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, tariffs, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds; and\ninsufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our manufacturers or performance by our partners.\nIn addition, our ability to identify, source and procure components of our inventories which we sell to customers may continue to be harmed by COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, History of Losses and Negative Cash Flow\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or income to satisfy our debt service and other obligations, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have historically generated material losses and negative cash flow. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness will depend on our subsidiaries and our franchisees future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. The Companys forecast for the twelve months from the date of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the possibility of insufficient resources to meet our ongoing obligations and maintain compliance with the minimum liquidity requirement of $10.0 million under the terms of our indebtedness. The Company has determined that these circumstances represent conditions about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern\nbefore consideration of managements plans. As such, in order for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and to fund our other needs, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to operate as a going concern and may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nWe are party to a senior secured Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated August 13, 2021, (the Senior Credit Agreement), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Australian Security Trustee, Lender, Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank, consisting of a $90 million revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year end, we entered into a Third Amendment to the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. This amendment reduced amounts available under the Senior Credit Agreement to $70 million, comprised of a $68 million term loan and a $2 million revolving credit facility, with a two-year term. The Senior Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that, among others, limit our ability to:\nincur indebtedness;\nincur liens;\nmake investments;\nsell assets;\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\nenter into swap agreements;\npay dividends and make distributions and repurchase stock;\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\nmaintain or contribute to a defined employee benefit plan or arrangement that is not subject to the laws of the U.S.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement. In addition we are a party to a Subordinated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023 with Alter Domus, as Administrative Agent, and certain lenders, including Kennedy Lewis Capital Partners Master Funds II and III LP, consisting of a $90 million term loan. The terms of the Subordinated Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive and financial covenants. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet these financial covenants. We cannot assure you that we will meet these financial covenants in the future, or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet these financial covenants.\nOur obligations to the holders of our Senior Credit Agreement and Subordinated Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. If we default on those obligations, the holders of such indebtedness could foreclose on our assets.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related transaction documents are secured on a first lien basis by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. Our obligations under the Subordinated Credit Agreement and the related transaction documents are secured on a second lien basis by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default on our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement or the Subordinated Credit Agreement, the collateral agent on behalf of the lenders (subject to the intercreditor agreement) could foreclose on the security interests and liquidate some or all of our assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe liquidity of our shares of common stock will likely be adversely affected by our delisting from the NYSE and anticipated deregistration from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nEffective September 5, 2023, the NYSE delisted the Companys common stock from the NYSE because, in the opinion of the NYSE, the Companys common stock was no longer suitable for listing based on its abnormally low price levels. The Companys common stock is now quoted on the Expert Market tier operated by OTC Markets. Quotes on the Expert Market are restricted from public viewing and the Companys common stock is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. All quotes in the Companys common stock reflect unsolicited customer orders. Unsolicited-Only stocks have a higher risk of wider spreads, increased volatility, and price dislocations. Investors may have difficulty selling our stock. An initial review by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule15c2-11 is required for brokers to publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making.\nWe can provide no assurance that trading in our common stock will continue. Because our stock now trades on the OTC Markets rather than being listed on a national securities exchange, we do not expect to attract the extensive analyst coverage that accompanies companies listed on national exchange, which may affect the liquidity of our common stock. Moreover, even if our trading in our common stock continues, our common stock is and will likely become more illiquid (especially following deregistration), which could negatively impact market prices for our stock and make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares.\nAs previously disclosed by the Company, after the Company has made all necessary SEC filings and is otherwise able to do so, the Company intends to file with the Commission a Form 15 to voluntarily deregister the Companys common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Following the termination of the registration, the Companys obligations to file periodic reports, such as annual reports on Form 10-K,\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, would be suspended immediately upon the filing of the Form 15 with the SEC. Following deregistration, we would not expect to publish periodic financial information or furnish such information to our stockholders except as may be required by applicable laws or stock exchange rules. As a result of the foregoing factors, deregistration may result in less disclosure about us and may negatively affect the liquidity and trading prices of our common shares. We would expect securities and industry analysts to likely cease coverage of us at such time.\nFurther, no assurances can be given that our common stock will ever actively trade, especially after the planned termination of the registration of our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspension of our reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In any of these events, there will likely remain a highly illiquid market for the Companys common stock and you may be unable to dispose of your common stock at desirable prices or at all.\nWe may require additional capital and our ability to raise capital is limited and will likely be significantly impaired.\nThe Company currently funds its operations primarily from cash on hand, credit facilities and operating cash flow. The Company has historically incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Companys forecast for the twelve months from the date of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the possibility of insufficient resources to meet its ongoing obligations and maintain compliance with the minimum liquidity requirement of $10.0 million in its credit agreement. The Company has determined that these circumstances represent conditions about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern before consideration of managements plans. As such, in the future, we may need to raise additional funds to support our obligations and operations through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing, however, may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Further, any sale or perception of a possible sale by our stockholders, and any related decline in the market price of our common stock, could impair our ability to raise capital. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to service our debt or fund our capital requirements and operations.\nIf we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nFurther, as a result of the delayed filing with the Commission of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, we are not eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement under the Exchange Act and do not expect to be eligible at any time in the future to as we expect to deregister our common stock as soon as we are able to. As a result, we will not be able to access the public markets to raise capital, which will further limit our ability to raise capital, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nIn addition, the trading of our common stock on the OTC Markets may materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and the limited liquidity and potentially reduced price of our common stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources or on terms acceptable to us or to complete acquisitions.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been very low recently, may continue to be very low, and may be subject to volatility and have limited market liquidity. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSince April 20, 2023, the trading price of our common stock has generally been below $1.00 per share. Our abnormally low trading price resulted in the NYSE delisting our common stock from the exchange. Our common stock is now quoted on the OTC Markets. The OTC Markets is a significantly more limited\nmarket than the NYSE or Nasdaq. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Markets may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future, any of which could result in a loss of all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock has also historically been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile, as well as illiquid, and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include:\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\nilliquidity and lack of marketability by being an OTC traded stock;\nchallenges associated with timely SEC filings (which is expected to continue until we deregister our common stock);\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\nintroduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations;\nresults of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors;\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\nannouncement by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts or acquisitions;\nsales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\nregulatory, legal or political developments;\npublic response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\nchanging economic conditions;\nchanges in accounting principles;\ndefault under agreements governing our indebtedness;\nexchange rate fluctuations; and\nother events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, actors of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Such a class action lawsuit was filed against us in December 2022 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint purported to allege securities class action claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and challenged misleading statements regarding our business model in our registration statement issued in connection with our initial public offering in July 2021. The claims were later amended to include claims under Section 10 of the Exchange Action of 1934 and to challenge statements in our initial public offering registration statement and later statements to investors regarding the companys business model plans, and results. See Part I, Item 1, Business - Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for additional details. We may incur substantial costs substantial costs defending such lawsuit and any future lawsuits that stockholders may bring against us. Such lawsuit could also divert time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur current major stockholders have significant control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters subject to stockholder approval, including a change of control.\nOur current major stockholders have significant control over our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters subject to stockholder approval, including a change of control. These stockholders, including certain of our directors, beneficially own approximately 79.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, such stockholders, if they act together, will be able to influence or control\nmatters subject to stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions, and would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. They may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. For example, affiliates of Kennedy Lewis Investment Management LP (KLIM) beneficially own [14.8%] of our common stock, but are also lenders under the companys subordinated credit agreement. As such, KLIM and its affiliates may have interests different than yours. Our concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of our company and could affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and as a result of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may follow reduced disclosure requirements and do not have to make all of the disclosures that public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more; (b) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of the initial public offering; (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which means the market value of our voting and non-voting common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed at least one annual report on Form 10-K). For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nThese exemptions include:\npresenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure;\nreduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;\nexemption from the requirements to hold non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements;\nextended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards;\nexemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\nexemption from complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis).\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards; and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions for emerging growth companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. Moreover, once we complete the deregistration of our common stock under the Exchange Act, we will no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC. As a consequence, there will be less public information available about our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations or other matters. If some investors find our common stock less attractive\nas a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our shares price may be more volatile.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nPursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSince we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on investment in our common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our common stock on the open market, which may not occur.\nWe are a holding company and depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets and intellectual property. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations and pay any future dividends to our stockholders depends upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to make payments, directly or indirectly, to us in the form of dividends, distributions and other payments. Any inability on the part of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Provisions in Our Charter Documents\nProvisions of our organizational documents could make an acquisition of our business more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\na classified board of directors, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, and the ability of stockholders to remove directors only for cause;\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\nthe ability of the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors;\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to take action by written consent; and\nsuper majority vote for stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nBecause our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace current members of our management team. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or our management may be unsuccessful.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL; (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or another state court or the federal court located within the State of Delaware if the Court of Chancery does not have or declines to accept jurisdiction), in all cases subject to the courts having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act but that the forum selection provision will not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. For example, under the Securities Act, federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision but will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operations\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our profitability and international growth prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had ### Total Franchises Sold in 74 countries around the world. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to operating in foreign countries, and any expansion of our international operations will increase the impact of these risks. These risks include, among others:\ninadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities;\ninconsistent regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;\nthe collection of royalties from foreign franchisees;\ndifficulty of enforcing contractual obligations of foreign franchisees;\nincreased costs in maintaining international franchise and marketing efforts;\nproblems entering international markets with different cultural bases and consumer preferences;\npolitical and economic instability of foreign markets, including due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict;\ncompliance with laws and regulations applicable to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control;\nactual or perceived threats to public health due to any health pandemic or epidemic;\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\noperating in new, developing or other markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations relating to contract and intellectual property rights.\nAs a result, new studios facing these risks in international markets may be less successful than studios in our existing markets. Further, effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our mission and standards.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.\nWe transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant royalties and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international royalties and expenses are denominated in local currencies, including Australian dollars, euros, British pounds, Canadian dollar and Singaporean dollar, which fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we derive significant royalties from our international operations, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of certain technologies. Our products may be subject to U.S. export controls, which may require submission of a product classification and annual or semi-annual reports. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products and services may create delays in the introduction of our products and services in international markets, prevent our international members from accessing our products and services, and, in some cases, prevent the export of our products and services to some countries altogether.\nFurthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products and services, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our members. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.\nWe could be subject to future enforcement action with respect to compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs and restrictions on export privileges that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe operate a global business and may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti- money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. These laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from corruptly promising, authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In many foreign countries, including countries in which we may conduct business, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We face significant risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or other partners or representatives fail to comply with these laws and governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur employees, contractors and agents, and companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law. Any such violation\ncould have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nGeneral Risks\nWe have identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses is not effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.\nIn the course of preparing our financial statements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses related to a failure to properly design and maintain effective controls over the review of non-routine revenue and purchase related contracts and their compliance with generally accepted accounting principles on a timely basis.\nWe believe we have taken the necessary actions to substantially address the material weaknesses discussed above, and we plan to take additional steps to improve our accounting function. However, we may not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until it can be confirmed that such remedial measures have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. Further, we cannot assure you that any such actions will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure\ncontrols and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our operating results, has caused and in the future could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and has resulted and may in the future result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC.\nWe are currently required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and report the results in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, although these obligations are expected to cease upon our planned deregistration under the Exchange Act. There is no requirement for audit of our internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, although these obligations are expected to cease upon our planned deregistration under the Exchange Act. To the extent applicable, if material weaknesses arise and they are not remedied, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. Any failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports (to the extent we provide them or alternative reports), limit our ability to raise financing or lead to regulatory sanctions, if applicable, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business or decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not held regular annual meetings in the past, and if we are required by the Delaware Court of Chancery to hold an annual meeting pursuant to Section 211(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, it could result in the unanticipated expenditure of funds, time and other Company resources.\nSection 2.1 of our bylaws provides that an annual meeting shall be held on a date and at a time designated by our board of directors, and Section 211(b) of the DGCL provides for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held for the election of directors. Section 211(c) of the DGCL provides that if there is a failure to hold the annual meeting for a period of 13 months after the latest to occur of the organization of the corporation, its last annual meeting or last action by written consent to elect directors in lieu of an annual meeting, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order a meeting to be held upon the application of any stockholder or director. Section 211(c) also provides that the failure to hold an annual meeting shall not affect otherwise valid corporate acts or result in a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation.\nIt has been longer than 13 months since we have held an annual meeting. To our knowledge, no stockholder or director has requested our Companys management to hold such an annual meeting and no stockholder or director has applied to the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking an order directing our company to hold a meeting. However, if one or more stockholders or directors were to apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking such an order, and if the Delaware Court of Chancery were to order an annual meeting before we are prepared to hold one, the preparation for the annual meeting and the meeting itself could result in the unanticipated expenditure of funds, time, and other Company resources.\nOur planned growth could place strains on our management, employees, information systems and internal controls, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced significant growth in our business activities and operations, including an increase in the number of system-wide studios. Our past expansion has placed, and our planned future expansion may place, significant demands on our administrative, operational,\nfinancial and other resources. Any failure to manage growth effectively could seriously harm our business. To be successful, we will need to continue to implement and improve our management information systems and our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls. We will also need to train new employees and maintain close coordination among our executive, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, risk management, marketing, technology, sales and operations functions. These processes are time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities and divert management attention, and we may not realize a return on our investment. In addition, we believe the culture we foster at our studios is an important contributor to our success. However, as we expand, we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our expanded operations. These risks may be heightened as our business continues to scale. Our failure to successfully keep pace with our planned expansion of studios could materially and adversely impact our business.\nWe and our franchisees could be subject to claims related to health and safety risks to members that arise at our studios.\nUse of our studios poses potential health and safety risks to members or guests through physical exertion and use of our services and facilities, including exercise equipment. Certain of such risks were exacerbated as a result of COVID-19. Claims have been and in the future might be asserted against our franchisees and us for injuries suffered by or death of members or guests while exercising and using the facilities at a studio. We may not be able to successfully defend such claims, and any such claims could materially damage our brand and the public perception of our brand. We also may not be able to maintain our general liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future or maintain a level of insurance that would provide adequate coverage against such potential claims. In the past, we may not have maintained the level of general liability insurance coverage appropriate for a business of our scale, and historical claims may be brought against us. Depending upon the outcome of any such claims, whether historical or not, these matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.\nNew accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.\nIn assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key personnel or an inability to attract, hire, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our senior management team and other key employees. We rely on our executives in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying growth opportunities and leading general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. For example, in the past 15 months, we have experienced significant turnover in our management team, which has disrupted our business operations, including our ability to file our SEC reports and filed our 2023 FDD. Our training professionals and sports scientists in our Athletics Department are also imperative to our success, and we rely on them to develop safe, effective and fun workouts for our members based on our algorithm.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain creative and experienced training professionals and sports scientists, we may not be able to generate workout content on a scale or of a quality sufficient to retain or grow our membership base. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees, including any of our training professionals or scientists, could have a serious adverse effect on our business. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nTo continue to execute our growth strategy, we also must identify, hire and retain highly skilled personnel. We might not be successful in maintaining our corporate culture and continuing to attract and retain qualified personnel. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a limited operating history with which to evaluate and predict membership retention rates.\nThe majority of our members may cancel their subscriptions at any time. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of member membership renewals, so we may be unable to accurately predict customer renewal rates. Additionally, prior renewal rates may not accurately predict future member renewal rates for a variety of reasons, such as members dissatisfaction with our offerings and the cost of our subscriptions, macroeconomic conditions, or new offering introductions by us or our competitors. If our members do not renew their memberships, our revenue may decline and our business will suffer.\nFurthermore, in the future, we may replace or modify current membership models, which could result in additional costs. It is unknown how our members will react to new membership models and whether the costs or logistics of implementing these models will adversely impact our business. If the adoption of new membership models adversely impacts our member relationships, then member retention, member growth, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nChanges in legislation in U.S. and foreign taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies, as well as the application of such laws, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent or future changes to U.S., UK, Australian and other foreign tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Further, we are in the process of implementing an international structure that aligns with our financial and operational objectives as evaluated based on our international markets, expansion plans and operational needs for headcount and physical infrastructure outside the United States. The intercompany relationships between our legal entities are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we are compliant with applicable transfer pricing and other tax laws in the United States, the United Kingdom and other relevant countries, due to changes in such laws and rules, we may have to modify our international structure in the future, which will incur costs, may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arms-length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property.\nIf U.S., UK, Australian or other foreign tax laws further change, if our current or future structures and arrangements are challenged by a taxing authority, or if we are unable to appropriately adapt the manner in which we operate our business, we may have to undertake further costly modifications to our international structure and our tax liabilities and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to additional obligations in other jurisdictions or to tax liability for past sales, which could adversely harm our business.\nState and local jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to our trainings in various jurisdictions is unclear. While we do not believe we are currently required to collect and remit sales or similar taxes on our equipment in any jurisdiction in which we are not already collecting such tax, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits. A successful assertion that we should be collecting sales, use, value added or other taxes on our equipment in those jurisdictions where we do not do so or have not historically done so, or that we have not collected the correct amount with respect to past taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our services or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risk of hurricanes, earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nOur headquarters is in Austin, Texas. Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. The third-party systems and operations and manufacturers we rely on are subject to similar risks. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, fire, or flood, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers and manufacturers businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting locations that store significant inventory for us, including equipment and World Pack offerings, that house our servers, or from which we generate content. These disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt suppliers and manufacturers businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business faces various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and financial results have been, and could be in the future, adversely affected by health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks impacting the markets and communities in which we and our customers, suppliers and franchisees operate. Despite our efforts to manage these matters, their ultimate effects also depend on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration, severity, and recurrence of any outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nMost members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage us as a public company and we will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors.\nPublic company obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management, as will the processes involved with our planned deregistration of our common stock under the Exchange Act, each of which could divert managements attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity/deficit, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue related reserves, fair value measurements including common stock valuations, useful lives of property plant and equipment, product warranty, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense and commitments and contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nWe are headquartered in Austin, Texas, where we lease approximately 44,000 square feet of office space. This lease expires in June 2029. We have one option to extend the lease for five additional years. On September 22, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Kouto Inc. to sublease a portion of the office space. In addition to the office in Austin, Texas, the Company has 22,500 square feet of office and warehouse space leased space in Palm Beach, Florida and the Company leases eight corporate-owned concept studios in Australia, and the United States. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. As of December 31, 2022, our franchisees operated 2,100 total studios, with the real estate of each being either leased or owned by the respective franchisee. We believe that these facilities are sufficient to meet the Companys current needs.\nFranchisees own or directly lease studio space for each franchise location. We have not historically owned or entered into leases for our franchisees and generally do not guarantee franchisees lease agreements, although we have done so in a few certain instances and may do so from time to time. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nSee Item 1 of Part I, Business - Legal Proceedings and Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18-Commitments and contingencies - Litigation. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPart II. Item 5. Market for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket information\nFrom our IPO on July 15, 2021 to our delisting from the NYSE on September 5, 2023, our common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol FXLV.\nAs of the date of this report, our common stock trades on the Expert Market tier operated by OTC Markets under the symbol FXLV. Quotes on the Expert Market are restricted from public viewing. The Companys common stock is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. All quotes in the Companys common stock reflect unsolicited customer orders. Unsolicited-Only stocks have a higher risk of wider spreads, increased volatility, and price dislocations. Investors may have difficulty selling the stock. An initial review by a broker-dealer under SEC Rule15c2-11 is required for brokers to publish competing quotes and provide continuous market making.\nOver-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Although our stock is quoted on OTC Markets, the existence of limited or sporadic quotations should not of itself be deemed to constitute an established public trading market. There is no established public trading market for our shares.\nHolders\nAs of October 19, 2023, there were 20 stockholders of record. This number does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because shares are often held in street name by securities dealers, brokers, institutions and others for the benefit of individual owners who have the right to vote their shares. We are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these record holders.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, debt covenants, general business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nRecent sales of unregistered securities\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company issued in a private placement immediately exercisable warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,211,210 shares of the Companys common stock to certain affiliates of Fortress Credit Corp, in connection with the Fortress Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 3-Summary of significant accounting policies. Each holder of the warrants also had the right to put back the warrants to the Company (the Put Option).\nOn May 17, 2022, the holders of the immediately exercisable warrants exercised the Put Option via a net share settlement, resulting in the issuance of 346,192 shares of common stock. The issuance of warrants and common stock was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. In August 2022 the company terminated the Fortress Credit Agreement and in September 2023, the Company deregistered all remaining shares of the Companys common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants.\nIssuer purchases of equity securities\nNone.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.\nThe following graph depicts the total cumulative stockholder return on our common stock from July 15, 2021, the first day of trading of our common stock on the NYSE, through December 31, 2022, relative to performance of the S&P 500, S&P Small Cap 600 and Russell 2000. The Company has selected the Small Cap 600 index in place of the S&P 500 index because it includes companies whose equity securities are of more comparable market capitalization. The graph and table shown below assume that $100 was invested on July 15, 2021 and that all dividends were reinvested.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Certain statements in this report, including statements regarding our business strategies, operations, financial condition, and prospects are forward-looking statements. Use of the words anticipates, believes, could, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will, would, will likely continue, will likely result and similar expressions that contemplate future events may identify forward-looking statements.\nThe information contained in this section is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in our common stock. We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the SEC, which are available on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. The section entitled Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this report, and similar discussions in our other SEC filings, describe the material factors, risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these or any other forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and reflect managements opinions only as of the date thereof. We do not assume any obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements. Finally, our historic results should not be viewed as indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nWe are focused on creating a leading global fitness training and lifestyle brand. We primarily offer consumers functional 45-minute workouts that are effective, fun and community-driven. Our workouts combine elements of high-intensity interval, circuit and functional training to offer consumers what we believe is the worlds best functional training workout. We deliver our workouts primarily through our digitally connected global network of studios, and we have built a differentiated, technology-enabled platform that allows us to create and distribute workouts to our global franchisee base. Our platform enables the scalability of our model and helps to promote the success of our franchisees. We offer consumers a continuously evolving fitness program in which virtually no two workouts are ever the same. We believe our library of functional training movements allows us to vary workout programs to keep consumers engaged with fresh content, stay at the forefront of consumer trends and drive maximum individual results, while helping our members achieve their fitness goals.\nOur Segments\nWe operate and manage our business based on geographic regions and our strategy to become a leading global fitness and lifestyle brand. We have three reportable segments: United States (which for segment reporting purposes includes our operations in the United States and South America), Australia and Rest of World. We refer to United States as the operations in the United States and South America. We refer to Australia as our operations in Australia, New Zealand and the immediately surrounding island nations. Our Australia segment also includes operations under our FS8 and Vive Active, Avalon House (which operations were wound down in 2023), and the wind down of operations performed during 2022 of our Malibu Crew brand. We refer to Rest of World or ROW as our operations in locations other than those in the United States and Australian segments. We evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources to them based on revenue and gross profit. Revenue and gross profit for all operating segments include only transactions with external customers and do not include inter-segment transactions. The tables on the following pages summarize the financial information for our segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In all other sections of this filing when we present geographic data, we are presenting such data for the named region on a stand-alone basis.\nHighlights for Fiscal Year 2022\nTotal revenue decreased from the prior year period by 17% to $104.4 million.\nSame Store Sales increased from the prior year 8.2% globally and 17.9% in the United States.\nSystem-wide sales increased from the prior year 26% globally to $518.5 million, and by 42% in the United States to $237.6 million.\nSystem-wide Visits increased from the prior year 10% globally to $29.6 million, and by 20% in the United States to $12.9 million.\nNet Franchises Sold totaled 362, resulting in system-wide Total Franchises Sold of 3,663.\nNet Initial Studio Openings totaled 351, resulting in system-wide Total Studios of 2,100.\nReported impairment charges of $27.3 million.\nReported net loss of $178.8 million.\nRestatement\nThe accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gives effect to the restatement adjustments made to the previously reported consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. For additional information and a detailed discussion of the restatement, see Note 2-Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We have also restated our previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30,2022 and September 30, 2022. For additional information related to the quarterly restatement, see Restatement of Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below.\nSystem-wide Sales\nWe define System-wide Sales as all payments made to our studios and includes payment for classes, apparel and other sales for a given period. We track System-wide Sales as an indication of the strength of our franchisee network.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our System-wide Sales were approximately $518.5 million, which compares favorably to approximately $411.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as presented in the table below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\n(in thousands)\nUnited States\n$ 237,633 $ 167,174\nAustralia\n171,698 177,260\nROW\n109,190 66,741\nTotal\n$ 518,521 $ 411,175\nSystem-wide Sales year-over-year growth of 42% in our U.S. segment and 64% in our ROW segment was driven by initial studio openings in the U.S. segment and ROW segment of 228 and 94, respectively, during the period. System-wide Sales year-over-year decreased by 3% for our Australian segment, primarily driven by increased market competition and a greater percentage of studios impacted by government mandated closures during the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by net studio openings of 29 during the year.\nSystem-wide Visits\nWe define System-wide Visits as the number of registered individual workouts for any specified period. A workout is registered when the consumer checks into a class.\nOur long-term growth will depend in part on our continued ability to attract and retain consumers to visit our studios for individual workouts. Our franchisees must continue to provide an experience that both attracts new consumers and retains existing consumers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our System-wide Visits were approximately $29.6 million, which compares favorably to approximately $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as presented in the table below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\n(in thousands)\nUnited States\n12,912 10,777\nAustralia\n9,955 11,680\nROW\n6,684 4,332\nTotal\n29,551 26,789\nSystem-wide Visits year-over-year growth of 20% in our U.S. segment and 54% in our ROW segment were driven by both initial studio openings during the period and a greater percentage of total studios which were not impacted by COVID-19 restrictions or temporary closures during the year. System-wide Visits year-over-year decreased by 15% for our Australian segment, primarily driven by increased market competition and a greater percentage of studios impacted by government mandated closures during the first quarter of 2022.\nNew Franchises Sold\nNew Franchises Sold refers to the number of franchises sold during any specific period. We classify Total Franchises Sold, as of any specified date, as (i) the total number of signed franchise agreements in place as of such date for which an establishment fee has been paid and (ii) the total number of franchises committed in a multi-studio agreement in place as of such date for which an upfront payment has been made, in each case that have not been terminated. Each new franchise is included in the number of franchises sold from the date in which we enter into a signed franchise agreement related to each such new franchise. Total Franchises Sold includes franchise arrangements in all stages of development after signing a franchise agreement, and includes franchises with open studios. Franchises are removed from Total Franchises Sold upon termination of the franchise agreement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nTotal Franchises Sold, beginning of period\n1,710 803 788 3,301 931 679 634 2,244\nNew Franchises Sold, net(a)\n328 (4) 38 362 779 124 154 1,057\nTotal Franchises Sold, end of period\n2,038 799 826 3,663 1,710 803 788 3,301\n(a) New Franchises Sold are shown net of franchises that were signed but subsequently terminated prior to the initial studio opening.\nNegative New Franchises Sold, net, represents periods in which terminations were in excess of new franchises sold. The decrease in New Franchises Sold, net, compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in multi-unit franchise agreement and development agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 199 new franchises under multi-unit or development agreements as compared to 716 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Of these multi-unit and development agreements, approximately 887 are not open as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, at December 31,\n2022, two development agreements, representing approximately 518 Total Franchises Sold, were not in compliance with their development schedule timelines.\nNew Franchises Sold, net, does not include any required openings under the terms of master franchise agreements.\nInitial Studio Openings and Total Studios\nInitial Studio Openings refers to the number of studios that were determined to be first opened during such period. Prior to October 1, 2021, we classified an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the first month in which the studio first generates monthly revenue of at least $4,500. Starting on October 1, 2021, we classify an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the month in which we record the Initial Studio Opening in our internal systems. Any studios that did not have an Initial Studio Opening under the prior definition are included as of October 1, 2021. We classify Total Studios, as of any specified date, as the total cumulative Initial Studio Openings as of that date less cumulative permanent studio closures as of that date. Neither Initial Studio Openings nor Total Studios are adjusted downward for studios that were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\nOur long-term growth will depend in part on our continued ability to open new studios. We believe that we will experience continued expansion of new studio openings in the United States and ROW. However, if delays or difficulties are encountered and new studio openings do not occur as quickly as we would like, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nTotal Studios, beginning of period\n654 653 442 1,749 486 616 335 1,437\nInitial Studio Openings, net(a)\n228 29 94 351 168 37 107 312\nTotal Studios, end of period\n882 682 536 2,100 654 653 442 1,749\n(a) Initial Studio Openings are shown net of studios that have permanently closed which had a recorded initial studio opening.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Same Store Sales Growth\nWe use a variety of non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Same Store Sales growth.\nEBITDA is defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and adjusted to exclude the impact of sales tax liability, transaction expenses, loss on derivative liabilities, certain legal costs and settlements, stock-based compensation expense, COVID concessions, relocation costs, charitable donations, and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA margin means Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin have been included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are important metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses our financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, provide investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our company and its results of operations.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\nOther Data: (in thousands)\nNet loss $ (178,799) $ (193,465)\nNet loss margin (171.2) % (154.5) %\nEBITDA $ (131,262) $ (137,961)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,140) $ 37,125\nAdjusted EBITDA margin(1)\n(2.0) % 29.6 %\nSame Store Sales growth(2)\n8.2 % 12.1 %\n(1)Management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to\ninvestors as they eliminate certain items identified as affecting the period-over-period comparability of our operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin eliminate, among other items, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from our capital investments and intangible assets, as well as income taxes, which may not be comparable with other companies based on our tax structure.\nOther companies may define Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently, and as a result, our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Although we use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because these measures do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nSome of these limitations are:\nthey do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or\ncontractual commitments;\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and\nthey are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not intended as alternatives to net income or as indicators of our operating performance and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Our GAAP-based measures can be found in our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing.\nThe following table reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\n(in thousands)\nNet loss $ (178,799) $ (193,465)\nInterest expense, net 14,983 59,353\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 22,356 (9,543)\nDepreciation and amortization 5,933 3,149\nAmortization of deferred costs 4,265 2,545\nEBITDA $ (131,262) $ (137,961)\nSales tax reserve(a)\n1,867 (265)\nTransaction fees(b)\n1,700 10,790\nLoss on derivative liabilities(c)\n- 48,603\nCertain legal costs and settlements(d)\n11,849 7,949\nStock-based compensation(e)\n21,324 88,231\nRecruitment(f)\n762 131\nCOVID concessions(g)\n8,283 8,282\nRelocation(h)\n408 3,930\nDevelopment costs(i)\n3,953 5,395\nCharitable donation(j)\n- 2,046\nRestructuring costs(k)\n14,919 -\nImpairment(l)\n25,157 -\nWrite-off of debt issuance costs(m)\n11,546 -\nWrite-off of development deals(n)\n27,262 -\nLoss (gain) on disposal of long-lived assets(o)\n2,360 (6)\nGoodwill impairment(p)\n2,189 -\nGain on warrant liabilities(q)\n(4,457) -\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,140) $ 37,125\n(a) Represents the impact of sales tax liability arising from a timing change in the ability to enforce certain contractual terms in arrangements with franchisees.\n(b) Represents transaction costs incurred as a part of a reorganization, acquisition-related costs in a business combination, and the issuance of preferred and common shares, including legal, tax, accounting and other professional services.\n(c) Represents loss on derivative liabilities associated with the convertible note.\n(d) Represents certain legal costs, primarily related to litigation activities and legal settlements.\n(e) Represents stock-based compensation of our employees, non-employees and directors.\n(f) Represents recruitment expense of executive leadership and essential public-company roles.\n(g) Represents concessions made to studios impacted by COVID, including one time COVID-19 related write-offs.\n(h) Represents costs incurred as a part of the relocation of certain employees.\n(i) Represents costs incurred with launch of new brands.\n(j) Represents one-time charitable donation intended to be made in the amount of total PPP loan forgiveness pursuant to the use of proceeds discussed in our IPO prospectus.\n(k) Represents costs incurred related to the restructuring performed in July 2022 (see Note 4-Restructuring to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n(l) Represents impairment charges incurred in the fourth quarter regarding the abandonment of the Flywheel CRM and charges incurred within the Malibu Crew and Avalon House asset groups.\n(m) Represents a one-time write-off of debt issuance costs incurred on the Fortress Credit Agreement.\n(n) Represents a one-time write-off of certain development deals.\n(o) Represents the loss associated with the disposal of a trademark.\n(p) Represents an impairment to goodwill.\n(q) Represents a gain on the fair value change of the warrant liabilities related to the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement.\n(2)Same Store Sales means, for any reporting period, studio-level revenue generated by a comparable base of franchise studios, which we define as Total Studios that have been operating for more than 16 months. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 1,532 and 1,234 studios, respectively, in our comparable base of franchise studios.\nSame Store Sales\nWe view Same Store Sales as a helpful measure to assess performance of our franchise studios.\nSeveral factors impact our Same Store Sales in any given period, including the following:\nthe number of studios that have been in operation for more than 16 months;\nthe mix of recurring membership and workout pack revenue per studio;\ngrowth in total memberships and workout pack visits per studio;\nconsumer recognition of our brand and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences;\nour and our franchisees ability to operate studios effectively and efficiently to meet consumer expectations;\nmarketing and promotional efforts;\nlocal competition;\ntrade area dynamics;\ninflationary pressures;\nopening of new studios in the vicinity of existing locations; and\noverall economic trends, particularly those related to consumer spending.\nSame Store Sales of our international studios are calculated on a constant currency basis on a studio level, meaning that we translate the current years Same Store Sales of our international studios at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. Vive is excluded from Same Store Sales figures.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Update and Recent Developments\nEuropean Master Franchise Agreement\nEffective as of September 30, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Franchise Agreement (MFA) with Club Sports Group, LLC (Club Sports), an affiliate of KLIM, pursuant to which the Company granted Club Sports the master franchise rights for in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In exchange, the Company will receive certain fees and royalties, including a percentage of the revenue generated by Club Sports. In accordance with the agreement, will assign existing franchise agreement rights to approximately 174 studios previously signed by the Company. Following December 31, 2022, the Company and Club Sports have engaged in discussions regarding a first amendment to the MFA that, among other things, may extend the transition time period during which Club Sports is required to assume franchisor and administrative duties.\nDeparture of Chief Financial Officer and Appointment of Interim Chief Financial Officer\nOn November 15, 2022, Chris Payne, Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board, notified the Company that he was resigning from his positions as Chief Financial Officer and director, effective immediately, to address immediate personal and family matters in Australia. At the time of his resignation, Mr. Payne did not serve on any committees of the Board. Mr. Paynes resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company relating to its operations, policies or practices or with its Board or management. Mr. Payne continued to support the Company in 2022, following his resignation, in an advisory capacity.\nOn February 13, 2023, the Board appointed Robert Madore as Interim Chief Financial Officer, to serve while the Board conducted a formal search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer.

The lender group consists of existing stockholders of the Company led by affiliates of Kennedy Lewis Investment Management LP (KLIM), the investment manager to significant stockholders of the Company and party to the Companys Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement. The New Credit Agreement provides for a $90 million, five-and-a-half-year term loan facility (the Term Loan) at an original issue discount of 3.00% payable in kind. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used by the Company to pay down $20.1 million of existing indebtedness and accrued interest and fees on its existing credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and to pay down other liabilities of the Company and for general corporate purposes. The obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors.\nAmounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate of 12.00% per annum, payable in kind. Upon repayment or acceleration of the Term Loan (including in connection with a change of control), the Company is required to pay an exit fee equal to: (i) 35% of the then-current principal balance of the Term Loan during the first 12 months following closing of the Term Loan; (ii) 25% of the then-current principal balance of the Term Loan during the next 12 months; and (iii) 10% of the then-current principal balance of the Term Loan thereafter.\nThird Amendment to Existing Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the entry into the New Credit Agreement, on February 14, 2023, the Company, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and Australian Security Trustee, entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment) to the amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of August 13, 2021 (as amended, the Existing Credit Agreement). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, certain amendments were made to the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement to permit the execution of the New Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment provides for a $70.0 million senior secured facility, comprised of a $68.0 million term loan and a $2.0 million revolving credit facility, with an interest rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 550 basis points per annum, and a two-year term.\nWaivers Under Credit Agreements\nIn connection with the delay by the Company to provide its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and its unaudited financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2023, the Company received waivers under both its New Credit Agreement and Existing Credit\nAgreement extending the deadline for its 2022 financial statements to October 20, 2023 and extending the deadline to provide the unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 to November 8, 2023. The Company believes it will be in a position to file its quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 by November 8, 2023. If the Company is unable to file its quarterly reports by such dates, it believes that it will be able to obtain a further waiver under the terms of the New Credit Agreement and the Existing Credit Agreement.\nAmendment of Letter Agreement\nIn connection with the entry into the New Credit Agreement, the Company and affiliates of KLIM entered into a letter agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023 (the Side Letter), with respect to certain governance matters, including changes to the Companys Board of Directors and the timing for the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Letter Agreement included certain mutual releases between the Company and the lenders under the New Credit Agreement. On April 14, 2023 and subsequently on July 13, 2023, the Company and affiliates of KLIM entered into an Amendment to the Side Letter to extend the time period provided to the Company to identify a permanent Chief Financial Officer candidate.\nAmendment to Subordinated Credit Agreement\nOn October 20, 2023 in connection with the Subordinated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Subordinated Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the lenders have agreed to extend credit in the form of an incremental loan in an original aggregate principal amount equal to $41.2 million, upon the same terms as the original loan amount. Approximately $5.0 million of the proceeds will be used to pay down a portion of the loan outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, the lenders have provided the Company with a delayed draw facility of up to $10.0 million.\nDelisting from the NYSE and Anticipated Deregistration from the Exchange Act\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company received notice from the NYSE indicating the Company was not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual due to the Companys failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the SEC. On May 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from the NYSE that, as of May 15, 2023, it was not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of the Companys common stock was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.\nIn response to such notices and the low trading price of the Companys common stock, the Company evaluated whether to remain listed or go dark. On August 10, 2023, the Company determined that going dark would be in the best interest of stockholders due to the expected substantial cost savings and the Companys inability to realize the traditional benefits of public company status. Accordingly, on August 10, 2023, the Board approved the voluntary delisting of the Companys common stock from the NYSE, the deregistration of the Companys common stock under Section 12(b) and Section 12(g) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the suspension of the Companys reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Effective September 5, 2023, (prior to the Company completing the voluntary delisting process), the NYSE delisted the Companys common stock from the NYSE because, in the opinion of the NYSE, the Companys stock was no longer suitable for listing based on its abnormally low price levels. After the Company has made all necessary SEC filings and is otherwise able to do so, the Company intends to file with the SEC a Form 15 to voluntarily deregister the Companys common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspend its reporting obligations under Sections 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nKey Non-GAAP Financial and Operating Metrics\nIn addition to our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, we regularly review the following key metrics to measure performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, compensate our employees, and monitor our business.\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of important factors, including new Franchises Sold, new studio openings and the number of visits.\nThe following table sets forth our key performance indicators for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands except, net loss per share):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\nNet loss $ (178,799) $ (193,465)\nNet loss margin (171.2) % (154.5) %\nNet loss per share $ (1.86) $ (3.21)\nSystem-wide Sales $ 518,521 $ 411,175\nSystem-wide Visits 29,551 26,789\nSame Store Sales growth\n8.2 % 12.1 %\nNew Franchises Sold, net 362 1,057\nTotal Franchises Sold, end of period 3,663 3,301\nInitial Studio Openings, net 351 312\nTotal Studios, end of period 2,100 1,749\nEBITDA $ (131,262) $ (137,961)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,140) $ 37,125\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (2.0) % 29.6 %\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the following sources:\nFranchise revenue: Consists primarily of upfront establishment fees, monthly franchise fees, and other franchise-related fees, including fees related to our brand fund, marketing and other recurring fixed fees paid by franchisees on a monthly basis for various services we provide, such as the use of intranet, email and the studios website. Franchise agreements generally consist of an obligation to grant exclusive rights over a defined territory and may include options to renew the agreement, generally for two additional five year terms, as well as the license for certain trademarks and systems to operate that studio.\nMonthly franchise fees generally become payable six to twelve months after we and a franchisee execute a franchise agreement, irrespective of whether the franchise has opened their studio. Monthly franchise fees are generally structured as the greater of i) fixed payments of $1,000-$3,000 per month per studio or ii) 7% of monthly gross sales per studio. However, franchises sold earlier in the companys operations, such as in Australia, primarily have a royalty structure that is a fixed amount per month.\nWhere charged, brand fund fees generally become payable at opening of the studio. Brand fund fees are generally structured as the greater of i) fixed payments of $200 per month per studio or ii) 2-3% of monthly gross sales per studio.\nEquipment and merchandise revenue: Consists of fees charged by us in exchange for (i) World Packs for new Training studios, which are comprehensive opening packs containing the standardized set of-branded fitness equipment and related technology required to operate an Training studio and (ii) subsequent additional and/or replacement equipment and merchandise sales to franchisees including technology, apparel and other fitness-related products. Typically, a portion of the World Pack fee is required to be paid upon the execution of a franchise agreement, with the balance due upon the earlier of: (i) the date the franchisee orders the World Pack; or (ii) six months from the effective date of the franchise agreement. During 2022, the Company began providing short-term financing to select franchisees with payment due upon the earlier of: (i) the opening of the studio; or (ii) twelve months from the date of the order. The franchise agreement mandates all franchisees to order and update new equipment on an annual basis.\nExpenses\nWe primarily incur the following expenses directly related to our cost of revenues:\nCost of franchise revenue: Consists of direct costs associated with franchise sales, lead generation and the provision of marketing services to our franchisees, including direct marketing costs related to the brand fund. Our Cost of franchise revenue changes primarily based on the number of Total Franchises Sold and Total Studios.\nCost of equipment and merchandise revenue: Primarily includes the direct costs associated with World Pack equipment as well as additional and replacement equipment and merchandise sales to new and existing franchisees. World Pack costs consist of the cost of the components included in opening packs sold to franchisees, including: (i) gym equipment; (ii) our tech pack (e.g., TVs,TV adapters / dongles, heart monitors); and (iii) uniforms and merchandise. Our Cost of equipment and merchandise changes primarily based on the World Pack equipment sales, which is driven by changes in Studios Open. Cost of equipment revenue is reduced by consideration (e.g., rebates) payable by the equipment supplier to the Company, in which the amount is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss generally upon delivery of the equipment.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses: Primarily consists of costs associated with wages and salaries, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, bad debt write-offs, and ongoing administrative and franchisee support functions related to our existing franchisees. Wages and salaries and costs related to ongoing administrative and franchisee support functions are primarily associated with brand marketing, fitness programming development and testing, onboarding, technology costs related to development and maintenance of our technology-enabled centralized delivery platform, marketing and promotional activities for the Training brand, and professional expenses.\nImpairment of fixed and long-lived assets: Our impairment of fixed and long-lived assets relates to non-cash impairment charges to long-lived assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets within the asset group. In instances in which the recoverability test is not met, an impairment charge is recognized equivalent to the carrying amount of the asset group in excess of its fair value.\nLoss on derivative liabilities, net: Our loss on derivative liabilities, net, relates to a non-cash change in the derivative liabilities fair value based on the probability of the IPO event from when the Company entered into the subordinated convertible debt agreement prior to the consummation of the IPO on July 15, 2021.\nChange in fair value - warrant liabilities: Our change in fair value - warrant liabilities relates to change in the fair value of outstanding warrant liabilities as a result of fluctuations in the Companys stock price and subsequent termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement.\nOther expense (income), net: Our other expense (income), net, primarily relates to fees incurred with the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement, gain recognized on the termination of lease agreements, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the effect of certain nondeductible expenses, permanent differences, foreign jurisdiction earnings taxed at different rates, withholding taxes, and a valuation allowance against certain domestic deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\nRevenues:\nFranchise (Related party: $9,314 and $5,221 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively)\n$ 72,762 $ 73,707\nEquipment and merchandise (Related party: $3,476 and $11,601 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively)\n31,661 51,513\nTotal revenues 104,423 125,220\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of franchise revenue 5,926 5,639\nCost of equipment and merchandise (Related party: $7,362 and $20,019 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively)\n26,649 34,452\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 191,376 180,911\nImpairment of fixed and long-lived assets 27,346 -\nTotal costs and operating expenses 251,297 221,002\nLoss from operations (146,874) (95,782)\nLoss on derivative liabilities, net - 48,603\nChange in fair value - warrant liabilities (4,457) -\nInterest expense, net 14,983 59,353\nOther income, net (957) (730)\nLoss before income taxes (156,443) (203,008)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 22,356 (9,543)\nNet loss $ (178,799) $ (193,465)\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nRevenue\nFranchise revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021\n(As Restated) $ %\n(dollars in thousands)\nFranchise\nUSA $ 46,239 $ 44,628 $ 1,611 4 %\nAustralia 12,779 12,877 (98) (1)\nROW 13,744 16,202 (2,458) (15)\nTotal franchise revenue $ 72,762 $ 73,707 $ (945) (1) %\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nTotal Franchises Sold, beginning of period\n1,710 803 788 3,301 931 679 634 2,244\nNew Franchises Sold, net(a)\n328 (4) 38 362 779 124 154 1,057\nTotal Franchises Sold, end of period\n2,038 799 826 3,663 1,710 803 788 3,301\n(a) New Franchises Sold are shown net of franchises that were signed but subsequently terminated prior to the initial studio opening.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nU.S.\nAustralia\nROW\nTotal\nTotal Studios, beginning of period 654 653 442 1,749 486 616 335 1,437\nInitial Studio Openings, net(a)\n228 29 94 351 168 37 107 312\nTotal Studios, end of period 882 682 536 2,100 654 653 442 1,749\n(a) Initial Studio Openings are shown net of studios that have permanently closed which had a recorded initial studio opening.\nTotal Franchise revenue of $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 represented a decrease of $0.9 million, or 1%, from $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Total Studios increased by 351, or 20%, from 1,749 as of December 31, 2021 to 2,100 as of December 31, 2022.\nThe $1.6 million, or 4%, increase in Franchise revenue in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of franchise sales, increase in studio openings in the United States, and a $1.7 million increase in Franchise revenues related to the launch of the marketing brand fund during August 2022. The amount of Total Franchises Sold in the United States increased by 328, or 19%, from 1,710 Total Franchises Sold as of December 31, 2021 to 2,038 Total Franchises Sold as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the number of Total Studios in the United States increased by 228, or 35%, from 654 Total Studios as of December 31, 2021 to 882 studios as of December 31, 2022.\nThe $0.1 million, or 1%, decrease in Franchise revenue in Australia for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily attributable to $0.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments as a result of weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The Total Franchises Sold in Australia decreased by four, or less than 1%, as a result of non-renewals and termination of franchise agreements, from 803 Total Franchises Sold as of December 31, 2021 to 799 Total Franchises Sold as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was partially offset an increase in Initial Studio Openings of 29 during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe $2.5 million, or 15%, decrease in Franchise revenue in ROW for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily attributable to the impact of one-time adjustments related to limited time promotional deals of $1.2 million as described in Note 3-Summary of significant\naccounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report, unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment as a result of the weakening of the euro, British pound, Singapore dollar, and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar of $0.7 million, and the acceleration of recognition of billing credits previously provided during COVID shutdowns for approximately 93 studios for which collection was no longer considered probable of approximately $0.8 million compared to the prior year. The number of New Franchises Sold in ROW decreased by 116, or 75%, from 154 Franchises Sold as of December 31, 2021 to 38 Franchises Sold as of December 31, 2022.

The total deliveries of equipment and merchandise decreased by 46, or 14%, from 329 deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 283 deliveries during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe $3.3 million, or 50%, decrease in Equipment and merchandise revenue in Australia for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 in Australia was primarily attributable to the decrease in equipment deliveries.

The increase in Selling, general, and administrative expenses was also attributable to a $27.7 million increase of payroll related to additional headcount prior to the restructuring performed by the Company during July 2022. The $27.7 million payroll increase includes $9.8 million of associated severance costs incurred for employees impacted by the restructuring and also a $1.0 million impairment of deferred cost due to increased capitalized commissions and payroll costs from the addition of new franchisees. Other contributing factors to the increase in Selling, general, and administrative expenses include a $13.9 million increase in legal and professional fees associated with ongoing legal proceedings, litigation accruals, and fees incurred with third party advisors for general corporate services, a $4.6 million increase in marketing expenses due to ongoing brand awareness, localized brand events, and promoter related expenditures, a $2.4 million increase from the disposal of a trademark, a $2.9 million increase in rent due to the move of our corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas as well as additional rent expense incurred associated with the acquisition of Vive and corporate owned studio space, a $2.6 million increase in state and local taxes, a $1.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense mainly related to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of Flywheel and Vive during July 2021 and October 2021, respectively, a $1.0 million increase in storage costs due to development agreements of which studios have not opened, and a $1.7 million increase in insurance expense as a result of director and officer insurance expenses subsequent to our initial public offering.

The liabilities for these embedded derivatives were measured at fair value as of October 6, 2020.\nThe $48.6 million loss on derivative liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021, was attributable to the change in the derivative liabilities fair value resulting from the Companys growing equity value and increasing probability of the IPO event from when the Company entered into the subordinated convertible debt agreement in October 2020 to the consummation of the IPO on July 15, 2021. The embedded derivatives were extinguished in connection with the repayment of the debt upon the IPO.\nChange in fair value - warrant liabilities\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021\n(As Restated) $ %\n(dollars in thousands)\nChange in fair value - warrant liabilities $ (4,457) $ - $ (4,457) -%\nThe $4.5 million decrease in Change in fair value - warrant liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was attributable to the change in the warrant liabilities fair value resulting from the decrease in the Companys share price subsequent to the issuance of the Warrants on May 13, 2022 and the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement on August 14, 2022. As a result of the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement, the outstanding warrants were considered terminated as of August 14, 2022, resulting in an extinguishment of the warrant liability.\nInterest expense, net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021\n(As Restated) $ %\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense, net $ 14,983 $ 59,353 $ (44,370) (75)%\nThe $44.4 million, or 75%, decrease in Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily attributable to the write off of debt discounts and penalties as a result of the early repayments of indebtedness in connection with the IPO, offset by the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the Fortress Credit Agreement. The following table reflects the write off of debt discounts and penalties incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 that are included in Interest expense (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\nFortress Credit Agreement $ 11,546 $ -\nSubordinated Convertible Debt - 23,740\nSubordinated Second Lien Loan - 17,497\nFirst Lien Loan - 241\nTotal $ 11,546 $ 41,478\nOther expense (income), net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021\n(As Restated) $ %\n(dollars in thousands)\nOther income, net $ (957) $ (730) $ (227) 31 %\nThe $0.2 million, or 31%, increase in Other income, net represents realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributed to a gain on the termination of the Companys Boynton office lease of $3.5 million in conjunction with the restructuring performed by the Company in July 2022, partially offset by a $2.5 million costs incurred with the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021\n(As Restated) $ %\n(dollars in thousands)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes $ 22,356 $ (9,543) $ 31,899 (334) %\nThe $31.9 million, or 334%, increase in Provision (benefit) for income taxes was primarily driven by the implementation of a full valuation allowance over our domestic and foreign deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held $5.3 million of Cash, cash equivalents, and Restricted cash relating to cash held in term deposits, of which $3.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. In the event that we repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries, we would need to accrue\nand pay applicable United Sates taxes and withholding taxes payable to various countries. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained an indefinite reinvestment assertion on any undistributed earnings and profits related to the foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States noting that its foreign operations remain in an E&P deficit.\nDue to a lack of liquidity to support our ongoing business, on February 14, 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) which provided for a $90.0 million, five and a half year term loan facility at an original issue discount of 3.00% payable in kind. Approximately $20.0 million of proceeds of the New Credit Agreement were used to pay down a portion of our existing debt owed and outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nDue to our continued lack of liquidity, on October 20, 2023 in connection with the Subordinated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Subordinated Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the lenders have agreed, subject to the satisfaction of the certain conditions precedent, to extend credit in the form of an incremental loan in an original aggregate principal amount equal to $40.0 million, upon the same terms as the original loan amount. Approximately $5.0 million of the proceeds will be used to pay down a portion of the loan outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, the lenders have agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to provide the Company with a delayed draw facility of up to $10.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our material cash requirements include contractual obligations from debt and lease obligations. Refer to Note 12-Debt and Note 18-Commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these material cash requirements.\nWe believe that our operating cash flows, proceeds resulting from our New Credit Agreement entered into on February 14, 2023 and October 20, 2023, assuming it becomes effective, and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs for the next 12 months. However, changes in our forecasted cash flow (including delays in updating our FDD which prevents us from selling new franchises and renewing existing franchise agreements), management planned costs reductions (including our inability to deregister from the SEC) and available funds could have a further negative impact on our future liquidity. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs we may seek to sell inventory, enter into new borrowing facility with one or more lenders, increase the borrowings under our existing facilities or reduce our operating expenditures, legal fees, and promotional and professional advisory contracts. However, it is uncertain whether such financing or reductions may be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to meet our operating, investing, and financing needs depends to a significant extent on our future financial performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including those described in Risk Factors\". In addition to these general economic and industry factors, the principal factors in determining whether our cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements will be our ability to globally expand our franchisee footprint. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs.\nCash flow\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (98,031) $ (38,024)\nNet cash used in investing activities (10,692) (35,371)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 73,108 85,378\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (1,055) 1,054\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (36,670) $ 13,037\nNet cash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $98.0 million, which resulted from a net loss of $178.8 million and a net decrease in cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $38.6 million, partially offset for non-cash charges of $119.3 million. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of a $31.8 million increase in Inventories, a $8.8 million increase in Accounts receivable which increased due to timing of collections from our customers and orders on equipment which we have provided payment terms of up to twelve months, a $4.3 million decrease in Deferred revenue, a $7.7 million increase in Other long-term assets (contract assets), $4.1 decrease in Other long-term liabilities, and a $3.3 million increase in Deferred costs due to increased capitalized commission and payroll costs from the additions of new franchisees, partially offset by a $6.5 million decrease in Other current assets as a result of the change in unbilled receivables, a $12.1 million increase in Accounts payable and accrued expenses, a $1.2 million decrease in Lease liabilities and a $4.6 million decrease in Prepaid expenses. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of a $27.1 million provision for bad debt, $22.4 million for deferred income taxes, $27.3 million for impairment charges, $21.3 million for stock-based compensation expenses, $11.5 million loss on the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement, $10.2 million for depreciation and amortization expense and $2.4 million for losses on the disposal of long-lived assets, partially offset by a $4.5 million gain on the Change in fair value related to warrant liabilities and $- million gain on the termination of the Companys Boynton Beach office lease.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to net loss of $193.5 million and a net decrease in Cash related to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $37.9 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $193.4 million. Changes in cash flow related to operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of $20.4 million increase in Accounts receivable, $16.6 million increase in Other long-term assets (contract assets), $9.9 million increase in Prepaid expenses, and $6.1 million increase in Inventories, $8.5 million increase in Other current assets, $3.6 million increase in Deferred costs, primarily offset by an $8.7 million increase in Deferred revenue, $16.3 million increase in Accounts payable and accrued expenses, $1.2 million increase in Income taxes payable, and $0.9 million increase in Other long-term liabilities. The increase in our accounts receivable was primarily driven by the increase in sales volume as our network began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and equipment sales and related rebates receivable in 2022. The corresponding increase in Other long-term assets (contract assets) was a result of a reduction in our invoicing and billing to franchisees whose studios were impacted by the pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Prepaid expenses was primarily due to the $4.0 million of prepayment for marketing services under the promotional agreement and $2.9 million of prepayment on an insurance premium during the year ended December 31, 2021. We increased our inventory in response to the increase in franchisee signings and in anticipation of the supply chain issue arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in our Deferred costs was driven by our success in continuing to sign new franchisees during the period. The increase in Accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the increase in inventory purchases and recognition of $4.2 million of liability-based stock awards in connection with the IPO that was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in Other long-term liabilities was primarily due to the $4.7 million of deferred rent associated with the lease\non our corporate headquarters offset by a $4.2 million reclassification of stock-based compensation expenses from Other long-term liabilities to Accounts payable and accrued expenses. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $88.2 million, loss on derivative liabilities of $48.6 million, a $8.7 million provision for bad debt, accretion and write off of debt discount of $31.6 million, in which $28.4 million relates to early repayments of indebtedness in connection with the IPO, and prepayment penalty included in interest of $13.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $10.7 million resulted primarily from purchases of property and equipment of $6.5 million, primarily related to our Austin headquarters and build-out of corporate studio space, purchases of intangible assets of $4.2 million primarily related to internal-use software development costs and trademark protection costs.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $35.4 million, consisted of asset purchases of Flywheel CRM software and Flywheel brand names of $25.0 million, acquisition of Vive of $3.7 million, net purchases of property and equipment of $3.5 million primarily related to leasehold improvements made to the new headquarter office in Austin, Texas, and purchases of intangible assets of $3.2 million primarily related to the implementation of the new Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, system and patent and trademark registrations.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to borrowings under our Revolving Facility of $88.1 million to provide cash to fund purchases and deposits placed on equipment and working capital. The net change in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by $11.8 million of tax withholding on Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) settlements, and $3.2 million in deferred financing costs paid related to the Fortress Credit Agreement which was terminated during the third quarter of 2022.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock of $277.8 million, net of offering costs, during the IPO, offset by repayments of debt facilities of $184.4 million in connection with the IPO, $7.0 million of repayment on the Term Facility prior to the settlement upon the consummation of the IPO, and $1.0 million of payments on debt issuance costs in connection with the modification of the Revolving Facility.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nContractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022, consisted of debt, letters of credit, and lease obligations. Refer to Note 12-Debt and Note 18-Commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the contractual obligations related to our debt and operating leases, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2022, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of guaranties provided by the Company for leases for office space by unconsolidated organizations and standby letters of credit. See Note 18-Commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these guaranties.\nRestatement of Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs further described in Note 2-Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. The restatement adjustments similarly impact the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for each of the interim periods within the year ended December 31, 2022.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred contract acquisition costs, the capitalization and estimated useful life of internal-use software, the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their useful lives, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, and accounting for income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our consolidated financial statements including those that involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting policies is essential when reviewing our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the critical accounting policies listed below are those that are most important to our results of operations or involve the most difficult management decisions related to the use of significant estimates and assumptions as described above. For a more detailed summary of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers are typically comprised of multiple performance obligations, including exclusive franchise rights to access our intellectual property to operate an Training-branded fitness facility in a specific territory (franchise agreements), a material right related to discounted renewals of the franchise agreements, and equipment and merchandise.\nFranchise revenue\nOur primary performance obligation under the franchise agreement is granting certain exclusive rights to access the Companys intellectual property to operate an Training-branded fitness facility in a defined territory. This performance obligation is a right to access our intellectual property, which is satisfied ratably over the term of the franchise agreement. Earlier franchise agreements had an initial term of three years while more recent agreements have an initial term of five years. Franchise agreements may also include options to renew the agreement. Renewal fees are generally recognized over the renewal term for the respective agreement from the start of the renewal period. With our approval, a franchisee may transfer a franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a transfer fee is paid. Transfer fees are recognized over the remaining term of the franchise agreement beginning at the time of transfer.\nOur arrangements have no material financing elements as there is no difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price. Additionally, we have assessed that a significant amount of the costs incurred under the contractual performance obligation are incurred up-front. We do not include significant financing components in our contracts.\nFranchise revenue consists primarily of upfront establishment fees, monthly franchise fees, advertising brand fund fees, and other franchise-related fees. The upfront establishment fee is payable by the franchisee upon signing a new franchise agreement and monthly franchise and related fees are payable throughout the term of the franchise license. Historically, franchisees have paid a fixed monthly franchise fee. For new franchisees, the franchise fee is based on the greater of a fixed monthly franchise fee or a percentage of franchise sales. Advertising brand fund fees are calculated as a percentage of monthly franchise sales and due monthly. Amounts collected for advertising brand fund fees must be spent on advertising, marketing, and other related activities. These brand fund fees represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to our performance obligation under the franchise agreement. As a result, these variable fees, such as percentage-based franchise fees and brand fund fees, are not estimated at the inception of our franchise agreement and instead recognized as revenue when invoiced, which occurs monthly. Brand fund fees are restricted to be used only for advertising and promotional activities to benefit the franchise; however, we have determined there are no performance obligations associated with brand\nfund contributions that are separate from the granting of certain exclusive rights to the Companys intellectual property.\nDiscounted franchise agreement renewal fees\nOur franchise agreements may include discounted renewal options allowing franchisees to renew at no cost or at a reduction of the initial upfront establishment fee. The resulting discount in fees at renewal provides a material right to franchisees. Our obligation to provide future discounted renewals to franchisees are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The value of these material rights related to the future discount was determined by reference to the estimated franchise agreement term, which has been estimated to be 10 years, and related estimated transaction price. The estimated transaction price allocated to the franchise agreements, including the upfront establishment fee, is recognized as revenue over the estimated contract term of 10 years, which gives recognition to the renewal option containing a material right. At the end of the initial contract term, any unrecognized transaction price would be recognized during the renewal term, if exercised, or when the renewal option expires, if unexercised.\nEquipment and merchandise revenue\nWe require our franchisees to purchase fitness and technology equipment (the World Pack) directly from us and payment is generally required to be made prior to the placement of the franchisees orders. Generally, each unit of equipment is considered a performance obligation. Occasionally, we provide short-term financing to select franchisees with payment due upon the earlier of: (i) the opening of the studio; or (ii) twelve months from the date of the order. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of ordered items, generally upon delivery to the franchisee or a destination provided by the franchisee, which is when the franchisee obtains physical possession of the goods, legal title has transferred, assessment of collectability is deemed as probable, and the franchisee has all risks and rewards of ownership. The franchisees are typically charged for all freight costs incurred for the delivery of equipment. We recognizes equipment revenue on a gross basis as management has determined the Company is the principal in a majority of its equipment revenue transactions as the Company controls its proprietary equipment prior to delivery to the franchisee, has pricing discretion over the goods, and has primary responsibility to fulfill the franchisee order through its direct third-party\nWe are the agent in a limited number of equipment and merchandise revenue transactions where the franchisee interacts directly with third-party vendors for which we receive a fee on sales directly from the vendor\nWe historically have accounted for fulfillment of World Pack equipment and merchandise required to be purchased as part of opening of a studio as a single performance obligation because transfer of control of equipment and merchandise occurred simultaneously at delivery to the studio. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of franchisees accepting delivery via third party storage facilities and an increase in the timing between the delivery of separate World pack components, we determined that transfer of control was no longer occurring simultaneously and no longer met the criteria to recognize as one performance obligation and instead are recognized individually at each point in time transfer of control occurs.\nAllocation of transaction price\nOur contracts include multiple performance obligations-typically the franchise license, exercise equipment, technology equipment, marketing materials, merchandise and material rights for discounted renewal fees. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for these performance obligations. We do not sell the franchise license or World Pack equipment on a stand-alone basis (our contracts with customers almost always include both performance obligations), as such the standalone selling price of the performance obligations are not directly observable on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information including the prices charged for each performance obligation within its contracts with customers in the relevant geographies and market conditions. Individual standalone selling prices are estimated for each geographic location,\nprimarily the United States, Australia, and ROW, due to the unique market conditions of those performance obligations in each region.\nChange in estimate\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we entered into franchise agreements that included a discount on upfront establishment fees and modified other contract terms as part of a limited-time promotional offer made exclusively to existing franchises (limited-time promotional deals). We deemed that the limited-time promotional deals did not meet the criteria of a contract at the inception of the agreement under ASC 606-10-25-1 due to our inability to determine that collectability under the agreements was probable, and as such, did not begin immediately recognizing revenue upon the inception of these franchise agreements. During the second quarter of 2021,we assessed the limited-time promotional deals and determined the criteria of a contract under ASC 606-10-25-1 had been met and, as a result, recorded a cumulative catch-up in revenue of $2.2 million. We noted the assessment of collectability was primarily driven by a review of post-COVID payment and collection history for franchisees who owned multiple studios within the Company's network, system-wide sales per region, and increases in post re-opening weekly visit volume and store-level gross sales volumes compared to specified periods in which the contracts were initially signed.\nOur United States subsidiary, Training, Inc., operates in various states within the United States which require us to defer collection of certain fees (the Deferred States), including the initial establishment fees, until certain criteria are met as specified by state and local requirements. In Deferred States, we concluded that the deferred establishment fees represent variable consideration as receipt was subject to uncertainty due to a lack of experience with contracts requiring deferral of establishment fees and uncertainty on the length of timing between inception of an agreement and the opening of a studio. As a result, establishment fees were excluded from the transaction price upon signing of the franchise agreements with franchises located in Deferred States. We re-evaluate the transaction price on our Deferred States franchise agreements if there is a significant change in facts and circumstances at the end of each reporting period. During the second quarter of 2021, we increased the transaction price of the Deferred States contracts by $1.7 million because of an enhanced history of franchise agreements and collections history on Deferred States franchise agreements, as well as a review of post-COVID payment and collection history for similar franchisees, resulting in the recognition of an additional $1.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nImpairment of fixed and long-lived assets\nWe assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment,\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an\nimpairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company recorded total impairment charges of $27.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in Impairment of fixed and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. There were no impairment charges recorded on long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible asset (trademark) to determine whether current events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. In addition, our indefinite-lived intangible asset is tested for impairment annually. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each asset with its carrying value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss. We are also permitted to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible assets fair value is less than its carrying value prior to applying the quantitative assessment. If, based on our qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the asset is less than its fair value, then a quantitative assessment may be required.\nWe perform our annual impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible asset during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. We also test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinite-lived intangible asset has been impaired. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than the carrying value and recognized an impairment loss of $2.1 million, which is included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. No impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible asset was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nBusiness combination\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Valuation methods include, but are not limited to, multi-period excess earnings for customer contracts, relief from royalty methods for brand names, and replacement cost for software. Such methods are widely accepted valuation techniques, which inherently use critical assumptions such as future revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nStock-based compensation\nOur stock-based compensation plan, which became effective at the IPO date, includes equity incentive compensation plans under which three types of share-based compensation plans are granted to our employees, directors, and consultants, including stock options (SOs), restricted stock units (RSUs), and restricted stock awards (RSAs). Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards subject to both performance and market conditions on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation cost for awards whose vesting is subject to the occurrence of both a performance condition and market condition is recognized immediately at the time the performance condition is achieved. Liability-classified awards are accounted at fair value at the grant date and remeasured at each reporting period until the awards are settled. In determining the valuation, we have utilized the valuation report prepared by third-party valuation specialists, as well as any significant internal and external events occurring subsequent to the report that may impact the fair value of the awards. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur by reversing compensation cost for unvested awards in the period in which they are forfeited. Estimates used in our valuation of stock-based compensation are highly complex and subjective.\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nFor recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the dates of the statement of financial position, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012\nWe have chosen to apply the provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act that permits us, as an emerging growth company, to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest rate risk\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had Cash, cash equivalents, and Restricted cash of $5.3 million deposited with major financial institutions, which consisted of bank deposits. Due to the short-term nature of these\ninstruments, our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to changes in our bank interest rates for which an immediate one percent change would not have had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nOur operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on the outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. Our revolving line of credit bears interest at a variable rate, which exposes us to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2022, we had $88.1 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our Senior Credit Agreement. An increase of 100 basis points in the effective interest rate on our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022 would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $0.9 million over the next 12 months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.\nForeign exchange risk\nWe report our results in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. The operations of Australia and ROW that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations. The majority of Australias operations, income, revenues, expenses and cash flows are denominated in Australian dollars, which we translate to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. ROW revenues and expenses in their respective local currencies are translated using the average rates during the period in which they are recognized and are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, loss from operations would have decreased or increased approximately $1.2 million if all foreign currencies uniformly weakened or strengthened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, holding other variables constant, including sales volumes. The effect of a uniform movement of all currencies by 10% is provided to illustrate a hypothetical scenario and related effect on\noperating income. Actual results will differ as foreign currencies may move in uniform or different directions and in different magnitudes. To date, we have not had a formal hedging program with respect to foreign currency, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Training Holdings Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Training Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders' (deficit) equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nRestatement of 2021 Financial Statements\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the accompanying 2021 financial statements have been restated to correct misstatements. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCosta Mesa, California\nOctober 20, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\nTraining Holdings Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share amounts and share data)\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n(As Restated)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,265 $ 42,004\nRestricted cash 69 -\nAccounts receivable, net 9,929 22,218\nDue from related parties, net 1,669 2,442\nInventories 42,497 10,289\nDeferred costs 1,886 1,887\nPrepaid expenses 7,850 12,706\nOther current assets 6,279 10,179\nTotal current assets 75,444 101,725\nLease right-of-use asset 14,258 -\nProperty and equipment, net 10,035 5,645\nDeferred tax assets, net -

(F45 Training Holdings, the Company, or F45) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 12, 2019 as a C-Corp. The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in franchising and licensing the Training brand to fitness facilities in multiple countries across the globe.\nTransaction with MWIG LLC (MWIG)\nOn March 15, 2019, MWIG, a special purpose private investment fund vehicle led by FOD Capital LLC, a family office investment fund, and Mark Wahlberg, made a minority preferred investment in the Company. On March 15, 2019, Training Holdings, MWIG and Flyhalf Acquisition Company Pty Ltd, a newly incorporated wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Training Holdings, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Aus Hold Co Pty Ltd (F45 Aus Hold Co) and its existing stockholders pursuant to which Training Holdings became the ultimate parent of Aus Hold Co and its subsidiaries. Upon the consummation of the transaction with MWIG, the existing stockholders and MWIG held 72.5% and 27.5% ownership interests, respectively, in the Company and, its wholly-owned subsidiaries. On December 30, 2020, MWIG converted 1,145,568 shares of preferred stock of the Company into 3,181,514 shares of common stock of the Company and sold those shares of common stock to affiliates of L1 Capital Fund, an Australian based global fund manager. See Note 19-Convertible preferred stock and stockholders' (deficit) equity for further discussion.\nPursuant to the SPA and in return for acquiring 100% of the shares in Aus Hold Co, Training Holdings issued 29,000,000 shares of common stock to the existing stockholders of Aus Hold Co proportionate to their relative ownership of the common stock of Aus Hold Co and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result of this transaction, there was no change in control. All references to shares in the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented herein, including but not limited to the number of shares and per share amounts, unless otherwise noted, have been adjusted to reflect the effects of the transaction retrospectively as of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nJoint Venture with Club Sports Group LLC\nOn May 16, 2022, the Company announced the formation of a joint venture with Club Sports Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (CSG), to, among other things, make, hold and monetize certain loans to prospective franchisees of the Company who have prior military service, with such loans secured by first priority senior liens on the equity interests of such franchisees and all or substantially all of the assets of such franchisee and its subsidiaries (if applicable). The joint venture will be conducted through FAFC LLC, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company (FAFC). CSG is wholly owned by Kennedy Lewis Management LP, a significant stockholder of the Company which beneficially owns directly or indirectly through funds it manages, as of the date hereof, in excess of 10% of the Companys outstanding common stock, and its related affiliates, and has the right to designate a member of the Companys board of directors. As of December 31, 2022, no activity has occurred through FAFC.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which are considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company consolidates variable interest entities (VIE) in which it is the primary beneficiary and has a controlling financial interest, which is defined as (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the entitys economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company has determined it possesses a variable interest in certain franchisee entities to which the Company provides a lease guaranty or financing (see Note 18-Commitments and contingencies) but lacks the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest. As our franchisee entities provide our franchisee the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance, we do not consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of any such entity that might be a VIE. The Company, therefore, is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary for these franchise entities and, as a result, does not include them in the Companys consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nKey estimates and judgments relied upon in preparing these consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; allowance for doubtful accounts; depreciation of long-lived assets; valuation of acquired assets and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination; internally developed software; amortization of intangible assets; impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets; valuation of inventory; fair value of derivative instruments, warrant liabilities, and valuation of stock-based compensation; and accounting for income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company currently funds its operations primarily from cash on hand, credit facilities and operating cash flow. The Company has historically incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Companys forecast for the twelve months from the date of these financial statements could result in the possibility of insufficient resources to meet its ongoing obligations and maintain compliance with the minimum liquidity requirement of $10.0 million in its credit agreement. The Company has determined that these circumstances represent conditions regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern before consideration of managements plans.\nIn response to these conditions, the Company plans to obtain additional financing and implement the following to reduce the demands on future Company resources: i) eliminate costs associated with being a public registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the filing of Form-15; and ii) manage the cash flows associated with non-recurring expenditures, including legal fees, certain professional services fees, and others. The Company has filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 25, 2023 to effect the voluntary withdrawal of the listing of its common stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of its common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and has the intent and ability to file Form 15 as soon as practicable after the outstanding filings with the SEC have been filed. Additionally management believes that they will be successful in limiting the non-recurring expenditures and managing the timing of such expenditures for at least twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. As a result, the Companys management believes that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments\nrelating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNote 2-Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements\nSubsequent to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, management identified errors in previously issued financial statements, as described below. As a result, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been restated from amounts previously reported.\nDescription of Restatement Errors\nThe errors identified are as follows:\na.Equipment and merchandise revenue - The Company prematurely recognized Equipment and merchandise revenue before the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 had been met. In particular, errors resulted from incorrect conclusions regarding (i) the identification and recognition of performance obligations for customer contracts and (ii) the assessment of criteria of a contract under ASC 606. The restatement resulted in a change in the timing of the recognition of revenue and deferred revenue until such transactions meet all the criteria for revenue recognition. The impact of this error to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, is a decrease to Equipment and merchandise revenue of $8.4 million, of which $4.7 million was a decrease in Equipment and merchandise revenue from related parties. The impact to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, is an increase to Other long-term liabilities of $0.6 million and Deferred revenue current of 7.5 million and a decrease to Accounts receivable, net of $0.3 million.\nb.Cost of equipment and merchandise - The associated Cost of equipment and merchandise for each equipment and merchandise revenue sales order was also recognized in the incorrect period. The impact of this error to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 is a decrease to Cost of equipment and merchandise of $0.1 million and a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.9 million. The $0.1 million decrease in Cost of equipment and merchandise includes a decrease of $4.1 million in gym equipment, offset by a $4.0 million increase in freight charges, all of which are classified as related party Cost of equipment and merchandise, The impact to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 is a decrease to Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.0 million and Inventories of $2.0 million.\nc.Vendor rebate - The Company prematurely recognized a $6.1 million rebate received from a vendor. The impact of this error to the consolidated statement of operations is an increase in Cost of equipment and merchandise by $6.1 million. The impact to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 is a decrease to Accounts receivable by $6.1 million.\nd.Income taxes - The Company recalculated its income tax expense on an annual and quarterly basis to account for the identified restatement adjustments. Restatements impacting book income and various asset and liability accounts had no net effect on deferred taxes or tax expense due to the Companys position of losses and resulting valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. The impact of this adjustment to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, is an increase to benefit for income tax of $2.5 million. The impact to the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 is a decrease to Deferred tax assets, net and Income taxes payable of $1.4 million and $4.3 million respectively.\ne.Other errors - There are other restatement errors otherwise not described in items (a) through (d) of this note. These errors and related restatement adjustments include:\nCorrection to record sales tax receivable of $1.2 million;\nCorrection to unbilled receivables and accrued sales tax of $0.7 million;\nCorrection from Accounts receivable, net to Other long-term assets of $0.4 million;\nCorrection to record accruals not previously recorded of $0.3 million;\nCorrection from Other current assets to Inventory for less than $0.1 million;\nCorrection to reverse duplication of revenue recorded for deliveries occurred of $0.4 million;\nCorrection from Selling, general and administrative expenses to Cost of franchise revenue of $0.2 million;\nCorrection to record payroll tax not previously recorded of $0.2 million; and\nCorrection from Other expense (income), net to Selling, general and administrative expenses of less than $0.1 million.\nThe following tables present the impact of the restatement to amounts previously reported.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\n(in thousands, except share amounts and share data)\nDecember 31, 2021\nAs Previously Reported\nRestatement Adjustments Restatement Reference As Restated\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 42,004 $ - $ 42,004\nAccounts receivable, net 27,788 (5,570) a, c, e\n22,218\nDue from related parties 2,442 - 2,442\nInventories 12,300 (2,011) b, e\n10,289\nDeferred costs 1,887 - 1,887\nPrepaid expenses 12,706 - 12,706\nOther current assets 9,515 664 e\n10,179\nTotal current assets 108,642 (6,917) 101,725\nProperty and equipment, net 5,645 - 5,645\nDeferred tax assets, net 22,716 (1,382) d\n21,334\nGoodwill 4,614 - 4,614\nIntangible assets, net 28,446 - 28,446\nDeferred costs, net of current 11,871 - 11,871\nOther long-term assets 21,960 404 e\n22,364\nTotal assets $ 203,894 $ (7,895) $ 195,999\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 36,594 $ (1,844) b, e\n$ 34,750\nDeferred revenue 7,137 7,844 a, e\n14,981\nInterest payable 276 - 276\nIncome taxes payable 9,624 (4,321) d\n5,303\nTotal current liabilities 53,631 1,679 55,310\nDeferred revenue, net of current 7,385 - 7,385\nOther long-term liabilities 12,605 628 a 13,233\nTotal liabilities 73,621 2,307 75,928\nStockholders equity\nCommon stock, $0.00005 par value;

The Company holds cash and cash equivalents at major financial institutions, which often exceed insured limits. Historically, the Company has not experienced any losses due to such bank depository concentration. Restricted cash relates to cash held in term deposits.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts\nAccounts receivable is primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company resulting from fees due from franchisees. The Company evaluates its Accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections and specific review of outstanding accounts receivable. Accounts receivable due greater than one year from the balance sheet date are included in Other long-term assets. Accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible when it is determined that further collection efforts will be unsuccessful.\nThe change in allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of the year $ 8,132 $ 5,746\nProvisions for bad debts, included in Selling, general and administrative 27,052 8,746\nUncollectible receivables written off (19,141) (6,360)\nBalance at end of the year $ 16,043 $ 8,132\nNone of the Companys customers accounted for more than 10% of the Companys gross Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. One customer accounted for $15.5 million, or 12%, of the Companys total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nInventories\nInventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory primarily consists of finished goods such as merchandise and equipment. The first-in, first-out method is used to determine the cost of inventories held for sale to franchisees. If the Company determines that the estimated net realizable value of its inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, it records a charge to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the Company, further charges may be required.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over its related estimated useful life. Refer to Note 6-Property and equipment, net for useful lives of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed in the period incurred. Expenditures for purchases and improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the term of the lease or useful life of the equipment. Upon sale or retirement, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any related gain or loss is reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized impairment charges of $0.8 million to its property and equipment. The\nimpairment charges are included within Impairment of fixed and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 6-Property and equipment, net for additional information related to these impairment charges.\nBusiness combination\nThe Company includes the results of operations of the businesses that the Company acquires as of the acquisition date. The Company allocates the consideration transferred for the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. These fair value determinations require judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance. The purchase price allocation may be provisional during a measurement period of up to one year to provide reasonable time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any such measurement period adjustments are recognized in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets that arise from acquisitions are recorded in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In accordance with this guidance, specifically identified intangible assets must be recorded as a separate asset from Goodwill if either of the following two criteria is met: (1) the intangible asset acquired arises from contractual or other legal rights; or (2) the intangible asset is separable. Intangibles are typically trade and brand names, customer relationships, and reacquired franchise rights. Transactions are evaluated to determine whether any gain or loss on reacquired franchise rights, based on their fair value, should be recognized separately from identified intangibles. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. The Company evaluates the reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in the operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, the Company reassigns goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach.\nThe Company capitalizes costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use when the preliminary project stage is completed. These capitalized costs are included in intangible assets and include third party cost of services procured in developing or obtaining internal-use software and personnel and related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Software development costs are amortized to Selling, general and administrative expenses using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years commencing when the software development project is ready for its intended use. Amounts related to software development that are not capitalized are charged immediately to Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe recoverability of software development costs capitalized under ASC 350-40 is evaluated in accordance with the methodology noted within the Impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets section below. When, in managements estimate, future cash flows will be insufficient to recover previously capitalized costs, the Company expenses these capitalized costs to Selling, general and administrative expenses in the period such a determination is made.\nGoodwill, trade names and trademarks that have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, as described below.\nImpairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets\nThe Company assesses potential impairment of its long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nGoodwill is tested annually on October 1 for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Generally, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If factors indicate that this is the case, the Company then estimates the fair value of the related reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each asset with its carrying value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss. The Company is also permitted to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible assets fair value is less than its carrying value prior to applying the quantitative assessment. If based on the Companys qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the asset is less than its fair value, then a quantitative assessment may be required. The Company also tests for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinite-lived intangible asset has been impaired.\nIf impairment indicators arise with respect to finite-lived intangible assets, the Company evaluates impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, then the Company estimates the fair value of the asset and compares the estimated fair value to the intangible assets carrying value. The Company recognizes any shortfall from carrying value as an impairment loss in the current period.\nLegal contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are uncertain. We record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine it is probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. In making such determinations we evaluate, among other things, the probability of an unfavorable outcome, and when we believe it probable that a liability has been incurred, our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nThe Company entered into a credit agreement, dated May 13, 2022 (the Fortress Credit Agreement), with a newly created subsidiary of the Company, SPV Finance Company, LLC as Borrower and Fortress Credit Group (Fortress), as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender, consisting of a $150.0 million (the Maximum Committed Amount) seven-year credit facility (the New Facility). In connection with the Fortress Credit Agreement, on May 13, 2022, the Company issued (i) immediately exercisable warrants (Immediately Exercisable Warrants) to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,211,210 shares of the Companys common stock with an exercise price of $16.00 per share of the Companys common stock, subject to adjustment as defined within the warrant purchase agreement, and (ii) warrants that will become exercisable on the date on which loans in an amount equal to 50% of the Maximum Committed Amount (as in effect on the date any warrant is issued) have been drawn under the Fortress Credit Agreement (50% Utilization Warrants and together with the Immediately Exercisable Warrants, the Warrants) (the date a 50% Utilization Warrant becomes exercisable upon reaching required utilization levels under the New Facility, a Vesting Date) to purchase up to 1.25% of the fully diluted shares of common stock as of the Vesting Date. The Fortress Credit Agreement was terminated on\nAugust 14, 2022. See Note 12-Debt for more information related to the Fortress Credit Agreement and its subsequent termination. See Note 14-Warrant liabilities for additional information related to the Warrants.\nThe Company accounts for its Immediately Exercisable Warrants and the 50% Utilization Warrants as defined above and in Note 14-Warrant liabilities under the provisions of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (ASC 815). ASC 480 requires the recording of certain liabilities at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these liabilities are recognized in earnings. The Company determined the fundamental transaction provisions required the warrants to be accounted for as a liability at fair value on the date of the transaction, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change. On May 17, 2022, the holders of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants exercised the Put Option via a net share settlement, resulting in the issuance of 346,192 shares of common stock.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nThe Companys contracts with customers are typically comprised of multiple performance obligations, including exclusive franchise rights to access the Companys intellectual property to operate an Training-branded fitness facility in a specific territory (franchise agreements), a right to discounted renewals of the franchise agreements (both reflected in Franchise revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss) and Equipment and merchandise. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are recorded on a net basis.\nFranchise revenue\nThe Companys primary performance obligation under the franchise agreement is granting certain exclusive rights to access the Companys intellectual property to operate an Training-branded fitness facility in a defined territory. This performance obligation is a right to access the Companys intellectual property, which is satisfied ratably over the term of the franchise agreement. Most agreements have an initial term of five years. Franchise agreements may also include options to renew the agreement. Renewal fees are generally recognized over the renewal term for the respective agreement from the start of the renewal period. With the Companys approval, a franchisee may transfer a franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a transfer fee is paid. Transfer fees are recognized over the remaining term of the franchise agreement beginning at the time of transfer.\nThe Companys arrangements have no material financing elements as there is no difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price. Additionally, the Company has assessed that a significant amount of the costs incurred under the contractual performance obligation are incurred up-front. The Company does not include significant financing components in its contracts.\nFranchise revenue consists primarily of upfront establishment fees, monthly franchise fees, advertising brand fund fees, and other franchise-related fees. The upfront establishment fee is payable by the franchisee upon signing a new franchise agreement and monthly franchise and related fees are payable throughout the term of the franchise license. Historically, franchisees have paid a fixed monthly franchise fee. For nearly all new franchisees, the franchise fee is based on the greater of a fixed monthly franchise fee or a percentage of franchise sales. Advertising brand fund fees are calculated as a percentage of monthly franchise sales and due monthly. Amounts collected for advertising brand fund fees must be spent on advertising, marketing, and other related activities. These brand fund fees represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to our performance obligation under the franchise agreement and are recognized as franchise sales occur.\nThe Company operates approximately 6 corporate-owned locations as of December 31, 2022. Membership revenues were deemed immaterial to the consolidated financial statements and included in Franchise revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nDiscounted franchise agreement renewal fees\nThe Companys franchise agreements may include discounted renewal options allowing franchisees to renew at no cost or at a reduction of the initial upfront establishment fee. The resulting discount in fees at renewal provides a material right to franchisees. The Companys obligation to provide future discounted renewals to franchisees are accounted for as separate performance obligations. The value of these material rights related to the future discount was determined by reference to the estimated franchise agreement term, which has been estimated to be 10 years, and related estimated transaction price. The estimated transaction price allocated to the franchise agreements, including the upfront establishment fee, is recognized as revenue over the estimated contract term of 10 years, which gives recognition to the renewal option containing a material right. At the end of the initial contract term, any unrecognized transaction price would be recognized during the renewal term, if exercised, or when the renewal option expires, if unexercised.\nEquipment and merchandise revenue\nThe Company requires its franchisees to purchase fitness and technology equipment (the World Pack) directly from the Company and payment is typically required to be made prior to the placement of the franchisees orders. During 2022, the Company began providing short-term financing to select franchisees with payment due upon the earlier of: (i) the opening of the studio; or (ii) twelve months from the date of the order. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of ordered items, generally, upon delivery to the franchisee or a destination provided by the franchisee, which is when the franchisee obtains physical possession of the goods, legal title has transferred, assessment of collectability is deemed as probable, and the franchisee has all risks and rewards of ownership. The franchisees are charged for all freight costs incurred for the delivery of equipment. Freight revenue is recorded within Equipment and merchandise revenue and freight costs are recorded within Cost of equipment and merchandise revenue. The Company had accounted for fulfillment of World Pack and merchandise required to be purchased as part of opening of a studio as a single performance obligation as transfer of control at delivery to the studio occurs simultaneously. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of franchisees accepting delivery via third party storage facilities the Company determined that performance obligations related to the point in time transfer of the World Pack were no longer being satisfied simultaneously. As a result, the Company determined the performance obligations no longer met the criteria to recognize as one performance obligation and instead are recognized individually as each point in time transfer of control occurs.\nThe Company is the principal in a majority of its equipment revenue transactions as the Company controls its proprietary equipment prior to delivery to the franchisee, has pricing discretion over the goods, and has primary responsibility to fulfill the franchisee order through its direct third-party vendor.\nThe Company is the agent in a limited number of equipment and merchandise revenue transactions where the franchisee interacts directly with third-party vendors for which the Company receives a fee on sales directly from the vendor.\nAllocation of transaction price\nThe Companys contracts include multiple performance obligations-typically the franchise license, exercise equipment, technology equipment, marketing materials, merchandise and discounted renewal fees. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for these performance obligations. The Company does not sell the franchise license or World Pack equipment on a stand-alone basis (the Companys contracts with customers almost always include both performance obligations), as such the standalone selling price of the performance obligations are not directly observable on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using available information including the prices charged for each performance obligation within its contracts with customers in the relevant geographies and market conditions. Individual standalone selling prices are estimated for each geographic location, primarily the United States, Australia and ROW, due to the unique market conditions of those performance obligations in each region.\nContract assets\nContract assets primarily consist of unbilled revenue where the Company is utilizing the costs incurred as the measure of progress of satisfying the performance obligation over time. When the contract price is invoiced, the related unbilled receivable is reclassified to trade Accounts receivable, where the balance will be settled upon the collection of the invoiced amount. The unbilled receivable represents the amount expected to be billed and collected for services performed through period end in accordance with contract terms. The unbilled contract assets are principally the result of a number of multi-unit franchise agreements executed during 2021 and credits provided to studios impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had contract assets of $5.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in Other current assets, and $11.1 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in Other long-term assets. These contract assets are subject to impairment assessment. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of impairment charges with respect to these assets within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nDeferred costs\nDeferred costs consist of incremental costs to obtain (e.g., commissions) and fulfill (e.g., payroll costs) a contract with a franchisee. Both the incremental costs to obtain and fulfill a contract with a franchisee are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company reviews existing franchisee contract terminations and, where terminations are identified, the associated contract and fulfillment costs are fully impaired. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $12.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively, of Deferred costs to obtain and fulfill contracts with franchisees. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $4.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in amortization of these Deferred costs, inclusive of impairment charges noted below. The amortization of these costs is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses for Costs to obtain a contract and Cost of franchise revenue for costs to fulfill a contract in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $3.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of impairment charges with respect to these assets within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nRevenue recognition-Change in estimate\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Company entered into franchise agreements that included a discount on upfront establishment fees and modified other contract terms as part of a limited-time promotional offer made exclusively to existing franchises (limited-time promotional deals). The Company deemed that the limited-time promotional deals did not meet the criteria of a contract at the inception of the agreement under ASC 606-10-25-1 due to the Companys inability to determine that collectability under the agreements was probable, and as such, the Company did not begin immediately recognizing revenue upon the inception of these franchise agreements. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company assessed the limited-time promotional deals and determined the criteria of a contract under ASC 606-10-25-1 had been met and, as a result, recorded cumulative revenue of $2.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The Company noted the assessment of collectability was primarily driven by a review of post-COVID payment and collection histories for franchisees who owned multiple studios within the Company's network, system-wide sales per region, and increases in post re-opening weekly visit volume and store-level gross sales volumes compared to specified periods in which the contracts were initially signed.\nThe Companys United States subsidiary, Training, Inc., operates in various states within the United States which require the Company to defer collection of certain fees (the Deferred States), including the initial establishment fees, until certain criteria are met as specified by state and local requirements. In Deferred States, the Company concluded that the deferred establishment fees represent variable consideration as receipt was subject to uncertainty due to a lack of experience with contracts requiring deferral of establishment fees and uncertainty on the length of timing between inception of an agreement and the opening of a studio. As a result, establishment fees were excluded from the transaction price upon signing of the franchise agreements within the Deferred States. The Company re-evaluates the transaction price on its Deferred States franchise agreements if there is a significant change in facts and\ncircumstances at the end of each reporting period. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company increased the transaction price of the Deferred States contracts by $1.7 million because of an enhanced history of franchise agreements and collections history on Deferred States franchise agreements, as well as a review of post-COVID payment and collection history for similar franchisees, resulting in the recognition of an additional $1.3 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021\nAdvertising\nAdvertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, advertising expenses included in Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $16.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax (benefit) expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws or enacted tax rates in the period during which they are signed into law. The factors used to assess the Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented. Under ASC 740, a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the correct character. Failure to achieve previous forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could negatively impact the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings.\nTax benefits from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within the Provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nForeign currency\nThe functional currency for the Company is the United States dollar. The Company has determined all other international subsidiaries functional currencies are the local currency. The assets and liabilities of the international subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while income and expense amounts are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are disclosed as a separate component of Other comprehensive loss. Transaction gains or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in Other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards subject to both performance and market conditions on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation cost for awards whose vesting is subject to the occurrence of both a performance condition and market condition is recognized immediately at the time the performance condition is achieved. Liability-classified awards are accounted for at fair value at the grant date and remeasured at each reporting period until the awards are settled, with all changes in fair value recorded in\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nBasic and diluted loss per share\nThe Company computes loss per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Companys convertible preferred stock are participating securities, as preferred stockholders have rights to participate in dividends with the common stockholders on a pro-rata, as converted basis. These participating securities do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Companys losses.\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nFair value measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements are based on a fair value hierarchy, based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying amount of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts receivable, Inventory, and Accounts payable and accrued expenses, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.\nThe warrant liabilities (see Note 14-Warrant liabilities) and promotional agreements (see Note 18-Commitments and contingencies) are Level 3 instruments and use internal models to estimate fair value using certain significant unobservable inputs which requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Such inputs include risk free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected volatility, and expected vesting date. These Level 3 liabilities generally decrease (increase) in value based upon an increase (decrease) in risk free interest rate, expected vesting date, and expected dividend yield. Conversely, the fair value of these Level 3 liabilities generally increase (decrease) in value if the expected volatility were to increase (decrease).\nDerivative instruments\nInterest rate swap\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility on its floating-rate debt. The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, which terminated in July 2021 in connection with the IPO. The principal objective of these agreements is to eliminate or reduce the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with the Companys floating-rate debt, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest payment cash flows. The Company elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for the agreement. The agreement was carried at fair value as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the agreement designated as a cash flow hedge was recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within stockholders (deficit) equity and was amortized to Interest expense over the term of the related debt.\nEmbedded derivatives\nWhen the Company enters into a financial instrument such as a debt or equity agreement (the host contract), the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of any embedded features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the remainder of the host contract. When it is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the host contract, and (ii) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a financial derivative instrument, then the embedded feature is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative liabilities. The estimated fair value of the derivative feature is recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets, separate from the carrying value of the host contract. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded as a gain or loss in within Loss on derivative liabilities in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe Company fair values the embedded derivatives using the Bond plus Black-Scholes option pricing model. Valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification review. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. The embedded derivatives were extinguished in connection with the repayment of the debt upon the IPO.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nUnder the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company (EGC). The Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842), by issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02). Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition, ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements, ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, ASU No. 2019-01, Codification Improvements, ASU No. 2019-10, Effective Dates, and ASU No. 2020-02, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to ASU 2016-02. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 with an effective date of January 1, 2022. The Company adopted the new standard using the effective date method by recording a right-of-use (ROU) asset of $8.4 million, short-term portion of lease liabilities of $1.7 million, and long-term portion of lease liabilities of $11.3 million as of the effective date. Prior periods will not be restated and will continue to be reported under Topic 840 guidance in effect during those periods. The Company\nelected the package of practical expedients to not reassess the classification of existing leases, whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, and initial direct costs for any existing leases. See Note 18-Commitments and contingencies for further information and disclosures related to adoption of this standard.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which amends ASC 740. This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by modifying the treatment of intraperiod tax allocation in certain circumstances, eliminating an exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences for foreign equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries when ownership or control changes, and modifying interim period tax calculations when a loss is forecasted. In addition, this ASU also requires that enacted changes in tax laws or rates be included in the annual effective rate determination in the period that includes the enactment date and clarifies the tax accounting of a step up in tax basis of goodwill. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2022, with no material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). Topic 326 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements, ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements, ASU No. 2019-05, Targeted Transition Relief; ASU No. 2019-10, Effective Dates, ASU No. 2019-11, Codification Improvements, and ASU No. 2020-02, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC section on Effective Date Related to ASU 2016-02, and ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The guidance changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance replaces the current \u2018incurred loss model with an \u2018expected loss approach. The guidance will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (ASU 2022-06), which provides companies with optional guidance, including expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and other transactions affected by reference rate reform, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). ASU 2022-06 is effective for the Company upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2022-06 on its consolidated financial statements; however, the Company does not believe that adoption of ASU 2022-06 will materially impact its consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., Deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning with the year ended December 31, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nNote 4-Restructuring\nOn July 26, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company initiated a reduction in force, reducing the number of Company employees by approximately 110 employees, which represented approximately 45% of the Companys total employees globally. This decision was made in light of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty in order to position the Company to achieve sustained growth over the near and long term, as well as the loss of growth capital as a result of the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into a separation agreement with its Chief Executive Officer and amended the employment agreement with its Chief Financial Officer (these actions are collectively referenced as the Restructuring Plan). The Restructuring Plan was substantially complete by the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\nDue to the actions taken as a result of the Restructuring Plan, the Company tested certain property and equipment and intangible assets for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows. Based on the results of the recoverability test, the Company determined that as of September 30, 2022, the undiscounted cash flows of certain asset groups were below the carrying values, indicating impairments. As a result, the assets were written down to their estimated fair value based on their expected liquidation value.\nCharges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to severance and personnel costs which include employee termination costs, costs associated with the separation agreement signed between the Company and former Chief Executive Officer, Adam J. Gilchrist, and costs incurred from the amendment to the employment agreement between the Company and then Chief Financial Officer, Chris Payne; financing-related charges associated with the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement; professional fees incurred as a result of the restructuring; and impairment charges associated with the write-off of assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company moved into the Austin, Texas headquarters and placed the assets associated with the new headquarters into service.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, management identified various qualitative factors that collectively indicated that the Company had triggering events, including (i) the change in plans regarding timing of franchising operations of the Malibu Crew and Avalon House concepts, and (ii) a sustained decrease in stock price. The Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain asset groups. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $0.2 million related to Avalon House, $0.4 million related to Malibu Crew, and $0.2 million related to Vive. No impairments were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021. Impairment charges are included within Impairment of fixed and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nDepreciation expense related to Property and equipment was $1.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation expense was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote 7-Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Surf & Turf Holdings Pty Ltd (Vive Active or Vive)\nOn October 29, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Vive Active. Vive Active, located in Australia, provides Pilates classes through its online platform and its studios. The consideration exchanged for the acquisition amounted to $7.5 million (50% cash up front and 50% deferred cash paid no later than 6 months after completion and which is not subject to any other conditions). The stock acquisition was a strategic transaction to leverage Vives intellectual property, content, and expertise to supplement the Companys brands, to expand the Companys corporate footprint across Australia and key global markets, and to leverage Vive management teams experience in developing corporate-owned studios.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred at the date of acquisition, as well as the calculation of goodwill based on the excess of consideration over the provisional fair value of net assets acquired (in thousands):\nFair value of consideration transferred:\nCash paid to shareholders $ 7,521\nLess: cash acquired (19)\nFair value of consideration transferred, net of cash acquired $ 7,502\nLess: net assets acquired\nAssets acquired:\nAccounts receivable $ 7\nInventory 53\nPrepaid expenses 31\nOther assets 30\nProperty and equipment, net 1,292\nIntangible assets 2,141\n$ 3,554\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ (161)\nShort-term debt (170)\nDeferred tax liability (497)\n$ (828)\nNet assets acquired 2,726\nGoodwill $ 4,776\nThe creation of goodwill in this transaction was the result of the expected growth in future cash flows and cost savings to be derived from economies of scale of combining Vives assets and workforce to the Companys business operations. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe acquired intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nUseful Life (in years) Fair Value as of October 29, 2021\nBrand name Indefinite $ 418\nSoftware 6 485\nCustomer contracts 7 1,238\nTotal $ 2,141\nThe fair values of the customer contracts and brand name were based on multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods, respectively. The fair value of the software was based on replacement\ncost method. Such methods are widely accepted valuation techniques, which inherently use critical assumptions such as future revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates.\nTransaction-related expenses of $0.3 million were expensed as incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nVive was consolidated into the consolidated financial statements starting on the acquisition date of October 29, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Companys consolidated revenue and consolidated net loss included $2.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, attributable to Vive. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Companys consolidated revenue and consolidated net loss included $0.5 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, attributable to Vive. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified a change in customer contracts and the use of the acquired software and IP which resulted in an impairment charge of $0.3 million (see Note 8-Goodwill and intangible assets).\nThe Company has not disclosed pro forma information of the combined business as the transaction is not material to the Companys consolidated revenue or consolidated net loss.\nAcquisition of Flywheel Sports, Inc. (Flywheel)\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into an intellectual property license agreement with FW SPV II LLC (FW SPV), a Delaware limited liability company, regarding certain intellectual property previously owned by Flywheel Sports, Inc. (Flywheel IP). The license agreement is for a period of five years at a rate of $5.0 million per year. The Company initially recorded $20.8 million of intangible assets when the license agreement became effective in April 2021 based on the present value of the annual payments throughout the term of the license agreement.\nOn July 19, 2021, after the consummation of the IPO, the Company acquired certain assets of the Flywheel indoor cycling studio business for $25.0 million in cash consideration, effectively transferring control of the assets to the Company and terminating the license agreement entered into in April 2021. The acquisition was accounted as an asset acquisition. On the acquisition date, the Company reversed the net carrying amount of $19.8 million of Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $0.8 million, and $20.6 million of the related liability that was initially recorded under the license agreement, resulting in a decrease to the cash consideration transferred by $0.8 million. The net purchase consideration of $24.2 million was allocated to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis, which primarily consisted of the client relationship management (CRM) software and trade names. The CRM software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 9 years, while the trade names have an indefinite life. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified a change in use of the acquired software which resulted in an impairment charge of $18.5 million and a change in the remaining estimated useful life to three years of the remaining asset balance. The change in estimated useful life was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate (see Note 8-Goodwill and intangible assets). The write-off of acquired software from the Flywheel acquisition was part of a strategic reassessment of the Companys long-term customer relationship management needs in light of recent headcount changes and the technical capabilities of certain of the Companys existing technology vendors and the wind down of the Companys operations of Malibu Crew and Avalon House in Australia. The Company determined that the estimated cash flows resulting from the change in use were less than the carrying values for certain intangibles as a result of this assessment. The impairment loss is included in Impairment of fixed and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote 8-Goodwill and intangible assets\nThe following table summarizes changes in the carrying value of Goodwill (in thousands):\nAmount\nAs of December 31, 2021 $ 4,614\nForeign currency translation (280)\nImpairment (2,189)\nAs of December 31, 2022 $ 2,145\nThe following table summarizes the useful lives and carrying values of intangible assets, including internal-use software (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021\nUseful Life Gross Value Accumulated Amortization Net Value Gross Value Accumulated Amortization Net Value\n(in years)\nInternal-use software 3 $ 5,852 $ 3,054 $ 2,798 $ 3,862 $ 2,077 $ 1,785\nTrade names & trademarks n/a 1,808 - 1,808 3,329 - 3,329\nCustomer contracts 7 733 30 703 1,194 30 1,164\nAcquired software 3 - 6\n966 13 953 23,324 1,156 22,168\nTotal intangible assets, net $ 9,359 $ 3,097 $ 6,262 $ 31,709 $ 3,263 $ 28,446\nThe amortization expense of intangible assets was $4.6 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The weighted average remaining life of internal-use software was 1.8 years and 1.6 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted average remaining life of acquired software was 2.3 years and 4.8 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company assesses potential impairment of its amortizable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. During the third quarter of 2022, management identified qualitative factors that collectively indicated the Company had a triggering event in which the carrying amount may not be recoverable, including (i) revision of forward guidance (ii) a reduction in force implemented by the Company and (iii) a sustained decrease in the Company stock price. As a result of the quantitative assessment, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 representing internal-use software and trademarks associated with the Companys United States subsidiaries of Malibu Crew and Avalon House, which the Company no longer intends to pursue.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified a change in customer contracts and the use of the acquired software and IP which resulted in an impairment charge of $0.3 million. There were no such impairments for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the performance of its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that the fair value was less than the carrying value and recognized an impairment loss of $2.2 million, which is included in Impairment of fixed and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. There was no goodwill impairment loss recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $19.9 million, caused by the write-off of acquired software and trade names from the Flywheel acquisition as part of a strategic reassessment of the Companys long-term customer relationship management needs in light of recent headcount changes and the technical capabilities of certain of the Companys existing technology\nvendors and the wind down of the Companys operations of Malibu Crew and Avalon House in Australia. The Company determined that the estimated cash flows resulting from the change in use were less than the carrying values for certain intangibles as a result of this assessment. The impairment loss is included in Impairment of fixed and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. No impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the expected amortization of intangible assets for future periods, excluding those assets not yet placed in service of $0.2 million, is as follows (in thousands):\nFuture Amortization\n2023 $ 1,669\n2024 1,339\n2025 760\n2026 174\n2027 165\nThereafter 100\nTotal $ 4,207\nNote 9-Other long-term assets\nOther long-term assets consists of unbilled receivables, right of return asset, debt issuance costs, investments in CLF High Street Limited, long-term accounts receivable and other long-term assets. The Company recorded a right of return asset related to World Packs that were sold to franchisees in 2022 pursuant to multi-unit development agreements. These agreements did not meet the criteria of a contract with a customer under ASC 606. The Company intends to recover the World Packs that were delivered, for which it has not yet received payment. The amounts for delivered World Packs have been recorded as a right of return asset. The following table summarizes long term assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n(As Restated)\nUnbilled receivables, net of current $ 11,112 $ 17,635\nRight of return asset 8,224 -\nDebt issuance costs 733 969\nInvestment in CLF High Street Limited\n590 540\nLong-term accounts receivable 2,135 404\nOther long-term assets 852 2,816\nTotal $ 23,646 $ 22,364\nNote 10-Accounts payable and accrued expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses were comprised of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n(As Restated)\nAccounts payable $ 21,767 $ 4,774\nAccrued sales tax 6,329 6,632\nAccrued payroll and benefits 3,281 1,858\nStock-based compensation liability - 4,221\nAccrued litigation expenses 9,613 4,177\nAccrued professional fees 3,557 2,691\nAccrued inventory purchases 3,089 10,284\nOther payables 849 113\nTotal $ 48,485 $ 34,750\nNote 11-Deferred revenue\nDeferred revenue results from establishment fees paid by franchisees at the outset of the contract term and the value of material rights related to discounted renewal options as well as equipment fees paid by franchisees prior to the transfer of the equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized approximately $18.8 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period. The following table reflects the change in Deferred revenue from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nDeferred Revenue\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 14,095\nNet change 8,271\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 (as restated) $ 22,366\nNet change (3,457)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 18,909\nDeferred revenue expected to be recognized within one year from the balance sheet date is classified as current, and the remaining balance is classified as non-current. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted franchise and equipment revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue recognized as revenue in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, remaining performance obligations were $18.9 million of which the Company expects to recognize approximately $15.9 million as revenue over the next 12 months.\nNote 12-Debt\nSubordinated Convertible Debt Agreement\nOn October 6, 2020, the Company entered into a subordinated convertible debt agreement (the Convertible Notes), whereby the Company issued $100.0 million of Convertible Notes to certain holders maturing on September 30, 2025. The Convertible Notes had an annual interest rate of 8.28%, which accrued as paid-in-kind through the duration of the contract. Repayment of principal and accrued interest was payable in cash or shares of the Company upon the occurrence of certain qualifying events or at the end of the contract term. Interest accrued over the term of the debt and was payable upon repayment at maturity or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events.\nAs a part of the subordinated convertible debt agreement, the Company identified embedded derivatives that required bifurcation under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, relating to the contingent conversion option, payment of liquidation, default payment and prepayment options. See Note 13-Derivative instruments for further discussion on the Companys accounting for these embedded derivatives.\nIn conjunction with the IPO on July 15, 2021, the outstanding Convertible Notes of $106.3 million of principal and interest were converted into 14,847,066 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $16.00.\nSubordinated Second Lien Term Loan\nOn October 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Subordinated Second Lien Term Loan (Subordinated Credit Agreement) with certain lenders which committed the lenders to provide $125.0 million of financing to the Company in exchange for a note payable. This agreement matured over a five-year period that carried a Paid-In Kind (PIK) Interest rate of 13.00%. PIK Interest accrued over the term of the Subordinated Credit Agreement. The Subordinated Credit Agreement had a maturity date of October 5, 2025.\nIn connection with the Subordinated Credit Agreement, the Company paid the lenders approximately $3.8 million in fees. Similarly, the Company paid third parties fees of approximately $1.0 million. The Company determined that all fees paid to the lenders and third parties would result in a reduction of the initial carrying amount. The Company amortized the debt discount and debt issuance costs into interest expense utilizing the effective interest method.\nOn July 19, 2021, the Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments and obligations under the Subordinated Credit Agreement. The Company used proceeds from its IPO to repay $150.5 million under the terms of the Subordinated Credit Agreement, inclusive of a prepayment penalty of $3.8 million and penalty of six months of advanced interest for $9.3 million as a result of the repayment of indebtedness or termination of the Subordinated Credit Agreement.\nFirst Lien Loan\nThe Company entered into a senior secured credit agreement, dated as of September 18, 2019 (the Secured Credit Agreement), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Australian Security Trustee, Lender, Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank, consisting of a $20.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) and a $30.0 million term loan facility (the Term Facility). Initial borrowings of $30.0 million from the Term Facility and $11.9 million of the availability under the Revolving Facility were used to repay, in full, amounts due to common stockholders as a result of the MWIG transaction. See Note 19-Convertible preferred stock and stockholders' (deficit) equity for further discussion. The remaining availability under the Revolving Facility may be drawn and used for general corporate purposes. The obligations under the Secured Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain operating subsidiaries of the Company and secured by a majority of the Companys assets. The Revolving Facility may be prepaid and terminated by the Company at any time without premium or penalty (subject to customary LIBOR breakage fees). The Term Facility bore interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%.\nOn June 23, 2020, the Company amended the Secured Credit Agreement to allow it to enter into a definitive agreement with a special purpose acquisition corporation. On October 6, 2020, the Company amended the agreement, pursuant to which amendment, the Company agreed to convert $8.0 million of the amount outstanding on the Revolving Facility to be part of the Term Facility. In addition to converting a portion of the Revolving Facility to the Term Facility, the Company agreed to repay $5.0 million of the principal amount of the Revolving Facility outstanding. The interest rate of both the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility were amended to 4.00% and 3.00% for Eurodollar loans and letters of credit, and ABR Loans, respectively.\nOn July 19, 2021, the Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments and obligations under the Term Facility. The Company used proceeds from its IPO to repay the Term Facility and Revolving Facility in the amount of $31.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively.\nOn August 13, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the Senior Credit Agreement) which amended and restated the Secured Credit Agreement dated September 18, 2019. The Senior Credit Agreement provides for a $90.0 million five-year senior secured revolving facility (Facility). The Senior Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances, the Company may increase the aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments by an aggregate amount of up to $35.0 million. The proceeds from the Facility are used for general corporate purposes. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate equal to either, at the Companys election, the LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.50% per annum, or base rate plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.50%, in each case depending on the Companys total leverage ratio, which was 7.19% at December 31, 2022.\nAs a result of the amendment, the Company modified the existing covenant under the Senior Credit Agreement. The total leverage ratio was modified to require the Company to maintain a total leverage ratio of less than 3.00 to 1.00.\nIn connection with the Senior Credit Agreement, the Company paid lender and third-party fees of $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, associated with the amendment. The Company concluded that the amendment resulted in a modification of debt rather than a debt extinguishment. As such, the Company determined that all fees incurred in connection with the Senior Credit Agreement would be deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement.\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment) to the Senior Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, certain terms of the Senior Credit Agreement were amended to permit the execution of the Fortress Credit Agreement (including establishing the securitization of the franchisee loans described below) and the issuance of warrants pursuant to the Warrant Purchase Agreement (see Note 14-Warrant liabilities).\nThe outstanding balance of the Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $88.1 million and $0, respectively. The unamortized debt issuance cost in connection to the Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.\nIn connection with the Facility, the Lender has issued standby letters of credit on behalf of the Company associated with our corporate headquarters. The outstanding commitments under these letters of credit as of December 31, 2022 totaled $1.6 million of which $0.1 million has expiration dates in less than one year and $1.5 million has an expiration date greater than one year. The amount of borrowings available at any time under the Facility is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding.\nOn July 25, 2022, the Company entered into a Waiver Under Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement Waiver) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and Australian Security Trustee. Pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement Waiver, certain lenders party to the Credit Agreement agreed to waive certain defaults under the Senior Credit Agreement related to cross-default provisions associated with required minimum market capitalization thresholds under the Companys Fortress Credit Agreement.\nSubordinated Credit Agreement\nOn February 14, 2023, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Subordinated Credit Agreement; collectively with the Senior Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreements) with certain subsidiaries of the Company party thereto as guarantors (the Guarantors), Alter Domus (US) LLC, as administrative Agent and Australian security trustee, and the lenders party thereto. The lender group consists of existing stockholders of the Company led by affiliates of KLIM, the investment manager to significant stockholders of the Company and party to the Companys Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement. The Subordinated Credit Agreement provides for a $90.0 million, five-and-a-half-year term loan facility (the Term Loan) at an original issue discount of 3.00% payable in kind. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used by the Company to pay down $20.1 million of outstanding amounts owed on the Senior Credit Agreement to pay down other liabilities of the Company and for general corporate purposes. The obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors.\nAmounts outstanding under the Subordinated Credit Agreement accrue interest at a rate of 12.00% per annum, payable in kind. Upon repayment or acceleration of the Term Loan (including in connection with a change of control), the Company is required to pay an exit fee equal to: (i) 35% of the then-current principal balance of the Term Loan during the first 12 months following closing of the Term Loan; (ii) 25% of the then-current principal balance of the Term Loan during the next 12 months; and (iii) 10% of the then-current principal balance of the Term Loan thereafter.\nWaiver Under Credit Agreement\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and Australian Security Trustee, entered into a Consent Under Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated March 31, 2023 (the JPM Credit Agreement Consent) under the Senior Credit Agreement.

Pursuant to the June 2023 Consent, the lenders agreed to extend the deadlines under the Subordinated Credit Agreement with respect to delivery of the Companys Financial Statements and financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, together with the accompanying compliance certificates, and financial projections, to August 31, 2023, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement Consent.\nAmendment of Side Letter Agreement\nIn connection with the Subordinated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023, by and among the Company, as borrower, the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as administrative agent and as Australian security trustee, the Company and affiliates of KLIM entered into a letter agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023 (the Side Letter), as previously disclosed in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2023. On July 13, 2023, the Company and such affiliates of KLIM entered into an Amendment to the Side Letter (the Amendment) to extend the time period provided to the Company to identify a permanent Chief Financial Officer candidate.\nConsents Under Credit Agreements\nOn each of August 31, 2023, September 15, 2023 and September 29, 2023, the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as administrative agent and Australian security trustee, entered into a Consent under Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the JPM Consents), under the Senior Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the JPM Consents, the lenders agreed to extend the deadlines under the Senior Credit Agreement with respect to delivery of (i) the Companys audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the 2022 Financial Statements), together with the accompanying compliance certificate, to October 20, 2023, and (ii) the Companys financial statements for the first and second quarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 (together with the 2022 Financial Statements, the Financial Statements) together with the accompanying compliance certificates, to November 8, 2023, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the JPM Consents.\nOn each of August 31, 2023, September 15, 2023 and September 29, 2023, the Company as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Alter Domus (US) LLC as administrative agent, entered into a Consent Under Subordinated Credit Agreement (the Subordinated Credit Agreement Consent and, together with the JPM Consents, the Credit Agreement Consents) under the Subordinated Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Subordinated Credit Agreement Consent, the lenders have agreed to extend the deadlines under the Subordinated Credit Agreement with respect to delivery of (i) the 2022 Financial Statements, together with the accompanying compliance certificate, to October 20, 2023, and (ii) the Companys financial statements for the first and second quarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, together with the accompanying compliance certificates, to November 8, 2023, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Subordinated Credit Agreement Consent.\nThe Company believes it will be in a position to file its quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 by November 8, 2023. If the Company is unable to file its quarterly reports by such dates, it believes that it will be able to obtain a further waiver under the terms of the New Credit Agreement and the Existing Credit Agreement.\nAmendment to Subordinated Credit Agreement\nOn October 20, 2023 in connection with the Subordinated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Subordinated Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the lenders have agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to extend credit in the form of an incremental loan in an original aggregate principal amount equal to $41.2 million, upon the same terms as the original loan amount. Approximately $5.0 million of the proceeds will be used to pay down a portion of the loan outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, the lenders have agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to provided the Company with a delayed draw facility of up to $10.0 million.\nFortress Credit Facility\nThe Fortress Credit Agreement, which was entered into on May 13, 2022 and terminated on August 14, 2022, consisted of a $150.0 million (the Maximum Committed Amount) seven-year credit facility (the New Facility). The Maximum Committed Amount could be increased to $300.0 million in certain circumstances under the terms of the Fortress Credit Agreement. The Fortress Credit Agreement required that the Company enter into a limited guaranty, guaranteeing the Companys obligations under the New Facility, in an amount not to exceed 10% of the total New Facility size. The proceeds from the New Facility were used by SPV Finance Company LLC in its capacity as the borrower thereunder to purchase loans made by another subsidiary of the Company, Intermediate Holdco, LLC, to certain franchisees of the Company (the Receivables). The obligations under the Fortress Credit Agreement were secured by the Receivables. Amounts outstanding under the Fortress Credit Agreement accrued interest at a rate equal to the amount of interest received by the Company from each franchisee loan agreement.\nThe covenants of the Fortress Credit Agreement included negative covenants that, among other things, restricted the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens and make certain acquisitions, investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. In addition, the Fortress Credit Agreement contained certain financial covenants that required the Company to maintain certain market capitalization levels. During July 2022, the Company determined it was no longer in compliance with covenants requiring minimum market capitalization thresholds in the Fortress Credit Agreement. Subsequently, on August 14, 2022, SPV Finance Company, LLC, delivered a notice to Fortress, as administrative agent, terminating its Fortress Credit Agreement. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Fortress Credit Agreement at the time of termination.\nIn connection with entry into the Fortress Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a warrant purchase agreement with certain affiliates of Fortress, pursuant to which the Company is obligated to issue warrants in up to four tranches, each representing 1.25% of the fully diluted shares of the Companys common stock outstanding on the issue date of the warrants (see Note 14-Warrant liabilities). As a result of issuance of the warrants, the Company determined the fair value of the warrants of approximately $8.9 million issued in connection with the Fortress Credit Agreement would be deferred and amortized over the term of the Fortress Credit Agreement. The Company recorded additional debt issuance costs for fees paid to lenders and third parties of approximately $2.9 million. As a result of the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement on August 14, 2022, the Company recorded Interest expense of $11.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 associated with the write-off of debt issuance costs incurred on the Fortress Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Company recorded additional charges of approximately $2.5 million associated with fees incurred with termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nPPP Loan\nOn April 10, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds of approximately $2.1 million under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), provides for loans to qualifying businesses to help sustain its employee payroll costs, rent, and utilities due to the impact of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Loans obtained through the PPP are eligible to be forgiven as long as the proceeds are used for qualifying purposes, which include the payment of payroll costs, interest on covered mortgage obligations, rent obligations and utility payments. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on its adherence to the forgiveness criteria. In June 2020, Congress passed the Payroll Protection Program Flexibility Act that made several significant changes to PPP loan provisions, including providing greater flexibility for loan forgiveness.\nThe Company used the proceeds from the PPP loan to fund payroll costs in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions of the CARES Act. The Company followed the government guidelines and tracking costs to ensure full forgiveness of the loan. To the extent it was not forgiven, the Company would have\nbeen required to repay that portion at an interest rate of 1% over a period of 1.5 years, beginning November 2020 with a final installment in April 2025.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the outstanding balance on the PPP loan including interest was forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The Company recognized a gain of $2.1 million from the extinguishment of the PPP loan, which is included in Other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company is subject to examination by the SBA as the total loan forgiveness exceeds the $2.0 million threshold.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense recorded on the debt facilities, excluding charges previously recorded associated with the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement, was $3.6 million and $59.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table reflects the write off of debt discounts and penalties incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 that are included in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nDebt Discount Penalty Total\nSubordinated Convertible Debt $ 23,740 $ - $ 23,740\nSubordinated Second Lien Term Loan 4,463 13,034 17,497\nFirst Lien Loan 241 - 241\nTotal $ 28,444 $ 13,034 $ 41,478\nThe weighted-average interest rate on the Companys outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022 was 7.33%. There was no outstanding debt as of December 31, 2021.\nNote 13-Derivative instruments\nInterest rate swap\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt. From time to time, the Company enters into swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nOn October 25, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract (the Swap Agreement) with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. to fix the interest rate on the Term Facility over the life of the loan. The notional amount of the swap covered the entire $30.0 million borrowings outstanding under the Term Facility. Under the terms of the Swap Agreement, the Term Facility, which formerly accrued interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%, started effectively accruing interest on the effective date (October 30, 2019) at a fixed rate of 1.74% on an annualized basis.\nTo hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to debt issuances. The Swap Agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge. The derivative's gain or loss was recorded in other comprehensive loss and was subsequently reclassified to Interest expense over the life of the related debt.\nOn July 21, 2021, in connection with the repayment in full of all outstanding obligations under the Subordinated Credit Agreement, the Company terminated the swap agreement. The Company paid $0.5 million to terminate the Swap Agreement. Due to the termination, the accumulated fair value of the interest rate swap was reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to Interest expense of $0.5 million in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of the termination, the Company had no interest rate liability as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nConvertible notes\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into a subordinated convertible debt agreement (the Convertible Notes) as discussed in Note 12-Debt, whereby the Company issued $100.0 million of\nconvertible notes to certain holders maturing on September 30, 2025. These notes were convertible\ninto common shares of the Company at the holders option. The Company analyzed the\nconversion and redemption features of the agreement and determined that certain of the embedded\nfeatures should be bifurcated and classified as derivatives. The Company bifurcated the following\nembedded derivatives: (i) Liquidity Event Conversion Option; (ii) Liquidity Event Redemption Option;\nand (iii) Qualified Public Offering (QPO) Redemption Option.\nThe $27.8 million initial fair value of the embedded derivatives for the Convertible Notes was\nrecorded as a debt discount along with a corresponding liability in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The initial debt discount was not subsequently re-valued and was being amortized using the effective interest method over the life of the Convertible Notes. Prior to the Companys IPO, the derivative liabilities were classified in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current as the Company was not required to net cash settle within 12 months of the balance sheet date and were marked-to-market at each reporting period. Changes in fair value were recorded within Loss on derivative liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAs discussed in Note 12-Debt, in connection with the IPO, outstanding Convertible Notes of $106.3 million, including principal and interest, were converted into 14,847,066 shares of common stock.\nNote 14-Warrant liabilities\nIn conjunction with the New Facility with Fortress, on May 13, 2022, the Company issued (i) immediately exercisable warrants (Immediately Exercisable Warrants) to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,211,210 shares of the Companys common stock and (ii) warrants that will become exercisable on the date on which loans in an amount equal to 50% of the Maximum Committed Amount (as in effect on the date any warrant is issued) have been drawn under the Fortress Credit Agreement (50% Utilization Warrants and together with the Immediately Exercisable Warrants, the Warrants) (the date a 50% Utilization Warrant becomes exercisable upon reaching required utilization levels under the New Facility, a Vesting Date) to purchase up to 1.25% of the fully diluted shares of common stock as of the Vesting Date.\nThe exercise price of the Warrants is $16.00 per share of the Companys common stock, subject to adjustment as defined within the warrant purchase agreement. The Warrants will be exercisable from the date of issuance (in the case of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants) or their Vesting Date (in the case of the 50% Utilization Warrants) until the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance of each Warrant, may only be exercised on a cashless net exercise basis, and are subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events such as a distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar event.\nEach holder of the Warrants had the right to put back the Warrants to the Company (the Put Option) once vested at an aggregate price (the Aggregate Put Price) equal to the product of (a) such holders percentage share of $2.5 million (calculated based on the number of Warrants issued to such holder relative to the number of Warrants issued to all holders) and (b) a fraction, expressed as a percentage, equal to the number of shares of the Companys common stock subject to the Warrants for which the Put Option is being exercised divided by the number of shares of the Companys common stock subject to the Warrants issued to the holder as of the issue date of the Warrant (in the case of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants) or the Vesting Date (in the case of the 50% Utilization Warrants). The Aggregate Put Price will be settled (i) within the first twelve months after the issue date (in the case of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants) or the Vesting Date (in the case of the 50% Utilization Warrants), solely in shares of the Companys common stock, subject to the Share Issuance Cap (as defined herein) and certain limitations on beneficial ownership of the holders (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation), based on a trailing volume-weighted average price (VWAP) or (ii) after the twelve month anniversary of the issue date (in the case of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants) or the Vesting Date (in the case of the 50% Utilization Warrants), in cash or shares of common stock based on a trailing VWAP, at the holders option, and subject to the Share Issuance Cap and the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. In the event that the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of the Put Option would\nexceed the Share Issuance Cap or the Beneficial Ownership Limitations with respect to a holder, a cash payment will be made in lieu of delivery of such excess shares of common stock.\nThe Immediately Exercisable Warrants and the 50% Utilization Warrants issued do not meet the criteria for equity classification and therefore must be recorded as liabilities pursuant to ASC 480 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging, respectively. The liability for these Warrants was recorded at fair value on the date of the issuance of the Warrants and subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date or exercise date with changes in the fair value included in earnings.\nThe fair value of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants and the 50% Utilization Warrants was calculated using a Binomial Lattice model. The following are the assumptions used in calculating fair value on the date of issuance:\nTrading price of common stock on measurement date $ 6.52\nExercise price $ 16.00\nRisk-free interest rate 2.9 %\nWarrant life in years 7.0 years\nExpected volatility 50.0 %\nExpected dividend yield $ -\nPut price (per share) $ 2.06\nExpected vesting date(1)\n5/31/2024\n(1) The expected vesting date criteria is only relevant in the calculation of the fair value of the 50% Utilization Warrants as the Immediately Exercisable Warrants vested at issuance.\nOn May 17, 2022, holders of the Immediately Exercisable Warrants exercised the Put Option via a net share settlement, resulting in the issuance of 346,192 shares of common stock.\nDue to the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement on August 14, 2022, the Company recognized a gain of $4.5 million in Change in fair value - warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the termination of the Fortress Credit Agreement, no warrants were outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nNote 15-Fair value\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements are based on a fair value hierarchy, based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe carrying amount of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash, Accounts receivable, Inventory, and Accounts payable and accrued expenses, as reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.\nThe warrant liabilities (see Note 14-Warrant liabilities), promotional agreements (see Note 18-Commitments and contingencies), goodwill and intangibles (see Note 8-Goodwill and intangible assets), property, and equipment (see Note 6-Property and equipment, net), and derivative instruments (see Note 13-Derivative instruments) are Level 3 instruments and use internal models to estimate fair value using certain significant unobservable inputs which require determination of relevant inputs and assumptions. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Such inputs include risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected volatility, and expected vesting date. The Level 3 liabilities generally decrease (increase) in value based upon an increase (decrease) in risk-free interest rate, expected vesting date, and expected dividend yield. Conversely, the fair value of these Level 3 liabilities generally increase (decrease) in value if the expected volatility were to increase (decrease).\nThe following table summarizes the Companys total Level 3 liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nDerivative Liability Warrant Liabilities Promotional Agreements Total Level 3 Liabilities\nFair value as of January 1, 2021 $ (36,640) $ - $ - $ (36,640)\nChange in fair value of derivative liability (48,603) - - (48,603)\nConversion of convertible debt into common stock 85,243 - - 85,243\nChange in fair value of promotional agreements - - 4,474 4,474\nFair value as of December 31, 2021 $ - $ - $ 4,474 $ 4,474\nIssuance of common stock pursuant to promotional agreement awards - - (5,094) (5,094)\nIssuance of warrants - 8,917 - 8,917\nExercise of put option on Immediately Exercisable Warrants - (4,460) - (4,460)\nChange in valuation of promotional agreements - - 620 620\nChange in fair value - warrant liabilities(1)\n- (1,265) - (1,265)\nTermination of 50% Utilization Warrants - (3,192) - (3,192)\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 $ - $ - $ - $ -\n(1) Change in fair value - warrant liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote 16-Income taxes\nThe Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax expense (benefit) is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to recognize the effects of changes in tax laws or enacted tax rates in the period during which they are signed into law. The factors used to assess the Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets are the Companys forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented. Under ASC 740 a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the correct character. Failure to achieve previous forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could negatively impact the Companys effective tax rate on future earnings.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\nThe tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within Provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nLoss before income taxes includes the following components (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nUnited States $ (148,783) $ (208,436)\nForeign (7,660) 5,428\nTotal $ (156,443) $ (203,008)\nThe following table summarizes the components of the Provision (benefit) for income taxes (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nCurrent\nFederal $ 574 $ 1,171\nState - 51\nForeign 437 3,842\nTotal Current 1,011 5,064\nDeferred\nFederal 12,020 (11,231)\nState 1,710 (1,605)\nForeign 7,615 (1,771)\nTotal Deferred 21,345 (14,607)\nTotal $ 22,356 $ (9,543)\nA reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the statutory federal income tax rate to income taxes as reflected in the consolidated financial statements is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nFederal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income tax expense, net of federal tax effect 1.3 % 0.5 %\nPermanent differences (2.5) % (3.7) %\nForeign rate differential 0.4 % (0.2) %\nConvertible note and related expenses - % (11.2) %\nOther adjustments (0.4) % (3.0) %\nWithholding tax (0.4) % (0.8) %\nUnrecognized tax benefits (7.6) % (0.1) %\nValuation allowance (26.0) % 2.2 %\n(14.2) % 4.7 %\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The significant components of the Companys Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2022 2021\nAccrued expenses $ 9,702 $ 14,575\nDeferred revenue 831 1,880\nNet operating loss & other carryforward 30,461 6,468\nProperty, equipment and intangibles 601 (562)\nLeased assets (2,467) -\nLeased liabilities 3,747 -\nDeferred costs (2,058) (2,034)\nTransaction costs 2,152 1,732\nStock-based compensation 869 1,475\nLess: Valuation allowance (43,838) (2,200)\nTotal Deferred tax assets, net $ - $ 21,334\nThe Company had gross deferred tax assets of $48.4 million and $26.1 million, respectively, and gross deferred tax liabilities of $48.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Gross deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances to the extent the Company determines it is not more likely than not the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. The gross deferred tax liability is inclusive of a valuation allowance of $43.8 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates its valuation allowance on an annual basis based on all the available positive and negative evidence. When circumstances change and this causes a change in managements judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is reflected in current operations.\nBased on the Companys policy on deferred tax valuation allowances and its analysis of positive and negative evidence with a few exceptions, management believed that there was sufficient evidence, including, but not limited to, a cumulative loss position, for the Company to conclude that it was not more likely than not that it would realize its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company determined that its future financial performance declined such that management determined that a 45% reduction in workforce was warranted. These significant impacts on the financial forecasts result is sufficient negative evidence that a valuation allowance is needed. As a result, a full valuation allowance was recorded against all of the Companys deferred tax assets across all domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $43.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of valuation allowances against gross deferred tax assets. The net increase (decrease) in the valuation allowance for Deferred tax assets was $41.6 million and $(4.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. All of the Companys tax years remain open for audit.\nIncluded in Deferred tax assets, net are federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards due to expire beginning in 2027 through various dates. The Companys federal NOL carryforwards do not expire. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state NOL carryforwards of $100.5 million and $119.9 million, respectively.\nThe Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits (exclusive of interest and penalties) was as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 3,699 $ 3,699\nGross increase - tax positions in prior periods - -\nGross increase - tax positions in current period 11,500 -\nEnding balance $ 15,199 $ 3,699\nThe Company recognized an increase in the unrecognized tax benefits related to deferred tax assets for marketing service awards that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized due to a insufficient evidence to support payment of the service awards. Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company recorded $0.3 million and $0.3 million of interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is included in Income tax expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained an indefinite reinvestment assertion on any undistributed earnings and profits related to the foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States noting that its foreign operations have experienced historical losses.\nNote 17-Related party transactions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $9.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of Franchise revenue, and $3.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, of Equipment and merchandise revenue due to related party transactions. These consist of sales made to related party studios. The Company expensed $7.4 million and $20.0 million with Cost of equipment and merchandise during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Club Franchise had 15 studios opened as of December 31, 2022 under the multi-unit studio agreement.\nClub Franchise is obligated to pay to the Company the same general fees as other franchisees in the U.S., and to enter into a franchise agreement in respect of each studio upon approval by the Company of the studio site. Consistent with some of the franchise agreements in the United States entered into since July 2019, Club Franchise is required to pay the Company a monthly franchise fee based on the greater of a fixed monthly franchise fee of $2,500 per month or 7% of gross monthly studio revenue regardless of whether such studios are open.

As of October 13, 2023, no franchise agreement rights had been assigned under the MFA. However, the Company anticipates assigning the franchise agreements in November 2023. The term of the MFA provides for a ten-year period for Club Sports to sell licenses to franchisees with the option to renew the MFA for two additional ten-year periods at the then current master franchise fee rate.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had established a litigation accrual of $9.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in Accounts payable and accrued expenses for claims brought against the Company in the ordinary course of business. Subsequent to year end, the Company resolved certain legal claims for approximately $6.3 million, which was included in the litigation accrual as of December 31, 2022, and paid during 2023. The Companys accruals for loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional information becomes available. The Company does not presently believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity, consolidated financial position, and/or results of operations.\nLease commitments\nEffective January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASC 842 using the effective date method for initial application. The Company elected the use of the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which allows the Company not to reassess whether a contract contains a lease, carry forward the historical lease classification, not reassess initial direct lease costs, and not separate lease and non-lease components for real estate assets. The Company also elected to apply the short-term measurement and recognition exemption in which the right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for short-term leases, representing those which have a term of less than twelve months. As a result, the Company has short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less that are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of this standard resulted in the Company recording ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $8.4 million and $13.0 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2022. The standard did not materially affect the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and had no impact on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. The Company evaluates whether (1) explicitly or implicitly identified assets have been deployed in the contract and (2) the Company obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As the Companys leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment.\nFor periods prior to January 1, 2022, the Company recorded rent expense related to leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Any difference between rent expense and rent paid as a result of lease incentives or rent abatement periods was recorded as deferred rent in Other long-term liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company lease portfolio consists of office buildings, a company-owned studio, and warehouse space in the United States, England, and Australia. Certain lease agreements contain options that allow the Company to extend the lease agreement. All of the Companys leases are classified as operating leases.\nIn conjunction with the restructuring performed during July 2022, the Company ceased use of a facility under an operating lease which was to be used for corporate-owned studio concepts. As a result of the restructuring and change in use of the operating right-of-use asset, the Company concluded a triggering event had occurred and, accordingly, an interim impairment test was performed. Based on the condition of the facility and lack of identifiable potential sub-tenants, the Company concluded the carrying value of the asset group exceeded its fair value and recognized an impairment expense of $4.2 million. On December 28, 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord in which all future payments were relieved in exchange for $0.8 million. As a result of the termination agreement, the Company recognized a gain on termination of the lease of $3.5 million which is included in Other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe following table summarizes the balances as it relates to leases as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nClassification December 31, 2022\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Lease right-of-use asset\n$ 14,258\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities Other current liabilities $ 2,559\nLong-term operating lease liabilities Lease liabilities, net of current portion 17,184\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 19,743\nComponents of Lease Cost\nOperating lease costs $ 3,464\nVariable lease costs 887\nShort-term lease costs 1,413\nTotal $ 5,764\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases 8.0 years\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 4.1 %\nMaturities of the operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nOperating Leases\n2023 $ 3,790\n2024 3,353\n2025 3,293\n2026 3,053\n2027 2,922\nThereafter 10,036\nTotal minimum lease payments 26,447\nLess: imputed interest (6,704)\nPresent value of lease liability $ 19,743\nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information related to leases were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2022\nCash paid, net, for lease liabilities $ 2,573\nOperating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 6,162\nGuarantees\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding guarantees of $2.7 million in aggregate total for lease payments related to 8 franchisee studio leases in the states of California, Maryland, and Virginia with non-cancelable lease periods ranging from 1 to 10 years.

Prior to the filing of the compliant, the Company recognized expenses associated with the DB Ventures promotional agreement over the service period which was to run through December 5, 2025.

The $10.0 million in funds raised by the issue of the additional Preferred Stock were used in full to partially settle the outstanding Sellers Notes.\nOn December 30, 2020, MWIG converted 1,145,568 shares of preferred stock of the Company\ninto 3,181,514 shares of common stock of the Company and sold those shares of common stock to affiliates of L1 Capital Fund, an Australian based global fund manager.\nThe rights and features of the Companys preferred stock are as follows:\nDividends\nThe Company shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company (other than stock dividends) unless the holders of the preferred stock then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share of preferred stock in an amount at least equal to the product of (1) the dividend payable on each share of such class or series determined, if applicable, as if all shares of such class or series had been converted into common stock and (2) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a share of preferred stock.\nLiquidation\nUpon the occurrence of a deemed liquidation event, as defined in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, before any distribution or payment to the holders of common stock, an amount equal to the greater of (1) preferred stock issue price per share for such preferred stock, as adjusted to reflect any combination or subdivision, stock dividend or other similar recapitalization, plus declared but unpaid dividends, if any, on such shares, and (2) the amount per share of common stock to which the holder would be entitled had all outstanding Preferred Stock shares been converted to common stock immediately before the distribution. After the distributions or payments to the holders of preferred stock have been paid in full, the entire remaining assets and funds, if any, will be distributed ratably among the holders of common stock in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them.\nConversion\nThe holder of each share of preferred stock has the option to convert the share at any time, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock that results from dividing the preferred stock issue price for the preferred stock share by the preferred stock conversion price that is in effect at the time of conversion. In addition, on (i) the consummation of Qualified Public Offering (as defined in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) or (ii) with the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, each share of preferred stock will be automatically converted. The preferred stock conversion price should initially be equal to the preferred stock issue price but subject to special adjustment upon either a Qualified Public Offering, a deemed liquidation event or a fair market value determination (each a Conversion Price Adjustment Event). Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Price Adjustment Event, the conversion price will be adjusted based on a formula, as defined in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which results in reductions to the preferred stock conversion price and additional value to the holder based on higher enterprise value; provided that in no event shall the preferred stock conversion price exceed $10.00 or be less than $7.2014 (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any combination or subdivision, stock dividend or other similar recapitalization).\nVoting rights\nThe holders of preferred, on an as-converted basis, and common stock vote together as a single class, except with respect to certain matters specified in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that require the separate approval of the holders of preferred stock.\nThe Company classified the preferred stock in temporary equity in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99 because the preferred stock is redeemable for cash or other assets of the Company upon a Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) that are not solely within the control of the Company. The net carrying amount of the preferred stock is not currently accreted to a redemption value because the preferred stock is not currently redeemable or probable of becoming redeemable in the future.\nIn July 2021, due to the completion of a public offering, all preferred stock outstanding was automatically converted into an aggregate of 27,368,102 shares of common stock with a conversion price of $16.00. There were no shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 20-Stock-based compensation\nIssuance of restricted stock units\nIn connection with the transaction with MWIG described in Note 1-Nature of the business and basis of presentation, on March 15, 2019, the Company entered into a promotional agreement with Mark Wahlberg (Mr. Wahlberg), a member of the Companys Board of Directors, Chief Brand Officer and an investor in MWIG, pursuant to which Mr. Wahlberg agreed to provide promotional services to the Company. In exchange for the agreed upon services provided in the promotional agreement, the Company issued 2,738,648 restricted stock units (RSUs) to Mr. Wahlberg.\nThe RSUs were to vest based on the Company attaining certain valuation thresholds upon a vesting event, defined as: (i) a deemed liquidation event or change in control; (ii) the closing of a financing transaction including the sale, issuance or redemption of the Companys (or one of its subsidiaries) equity securities, and any initial public offering; or (iii) at any time that the Companys common stock is publicly traded, with the Companys equity value exceeding the following thresholds:\nCompany Equity Value Threshold Potential Restricted Stock Units Vested\n$1.0 billion 912,882\n$1.5 billion 912,882\n$2.0 billion 912,884\nThe Company determined that the RSUs are equity classified awards that contained both performance (deemed liquidation event, closing of a financing transaction or the public trading of the Companys common stock) and market conditions (achievement of prescribed Company equity values) in order for the units to vest.\nOn July 5, 2021, the Company approved the acceleration of Mr. Wahlbergs RSUs such that 100% of the RSUs granted to Mr. Wahlberg are fully vested concurrent with and subject to the consummation of the IPO, effectively eliminating the market condition based on the achievement of prescribed Company equity values. The RSUs shall be settled in shares of common stock on a date determined by the Company during 2022 but no later than March 15, 2022. All remaining terms and conditions in the original promotional agreement are still applicable. The Company determined the modification of the RSUs as a Type IV modification in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, because at the modification date, both the original and modified awards were considered improbable of vesting as the performance condition has not been met on the modification date of July 5, 2021. The Company utilized the assumed initial public offering price of $16.00 per share as the modification date fair value.\nIn connection with the Company becoming publicly traded on July 15, 2021, the fair value of the RSUs of 2,738,648 became fully vested and were recognized as compensation expense in the amount of $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n2021 Incentive Plan\nThe Companys stock-based compensation plan, which became effective at the IPO date, includes equity incentive compensation plans under which three types of share-based compensation plans are granted to the employees, directors and consultants of the Company, which are stock options (SOs), RSUs and restricted stock awards (RSAs). The purpose of the plan is to assist the Company in securing and retaining the service of eligible award recipients, to provide incentives to employees, directors and consultants and promote the long-term financial success of the Company and thereby increase stockholder value. In accordance with the 2021 Incentive Plan, subject to adjustment for certain dilutive or related events, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be subject to stock awards and sold under this plan is 5,000,000 shares, or the share reserve (Share Reserve). Beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on January 1, 2031, the Share Reserve will automatically increase on January 1 of each year during the term of the 2021 Incentive Plan in an amount equal to 5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year; provided, however, that the Companys board of directors may provide that there will not be a January 1 increase in the Share Reserve in a given year or that the increase will be less than 5% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the preceding December 31.\nEmployees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards. In accordance with the Companys accounting policy, forfeitures of SOs, RSUs and RSAs are accounted for as they occur.\nStock options\nSOs granted under the incentive equity plans are generally non-statutory stock options, but the incentive equity plans permit some options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. SOs generally vest over one to three years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of the Companys stock on the option grant date. The majority of SOs issued by the Company are subject to only service vesting conditions.\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of SOs subject to service-based vesting conditions. The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value for SOs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 were as follows:\n2022 2021\nWeighted-average fair value(1)\n$ 1.51 $ 4.67\nRisk-free interest rate(2)\n2.20% - 3.51%\n0.92% - 1.33%\nExpected dividend yield(3)\n- -\nExpected volatility(4)\n26.40% - 42.14%\n26.30% - 29.20%\nExpected term in years 5.05 - 6.25\n5.46 - 5.76\n(1) The weighted-average fair value based on stock options granted during the period.\n(2) The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on U.S. Treasury scrips.\n(3) The expected dividend yield represents a constant dividend yield applied for the duration of the expected term of the award.\n(4) Selected volatility is relevered equity volatility based on median asset volatility.\nA summary of option activity under the employee share option plan as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and changes during the period then ended, is presented below:\nShares (in thousands) Weighted - Average Exercise Price Weighted - Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2021 - $ - $ -\nGranted 267 15.93\nExercised - -\nForfeited, expired, or canceled (15) 16.00\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 252 $ 15.92 $ -\nGranted 2,254 4.25\nExercised - -\nForfeited, expired, or canceled (315) 12.36\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 2,191 $ 4.43 10.42 $ 1,160\nVested and exercisable 1,198 $ 4.13 9.72 $ 580\nExpected to vest 993 $ 4.80 11.26 $ 580\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have realized had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of the year ended December 31, 2022. The aggregate intrinsic value of vested and unvested options as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.2 million and $0, respectively, as options as of December 31, 2021 were out-of-the-money. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between the Companys closing stock price of $2.85 and $10.89, respectively, on the last trading day of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no options were exercised, respectively. The total grant date fair value of the options vested during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to the ISO was $1.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.62 and 1.55 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the maximum contractual term of the ISO is approximately 10.0 years.\nRestricted stock units\nRSUs may be granted at any time and from time to time as determined by the Company. The Company will set vesting criteria at its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of RSUs that will be paid out to the participant. The Company may set vesting criteria based upon the passage of time, the achievement of target levels of performance, or the occurrence of other events or any combination thereof as determined by the Company at its discretion. Dividend equivalents shall not be paid on an RSU during the period it is unvested. The RSUs granted by the Company are subject to service vesting conditions. RSUs also provide for accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plans and related grant agreements.\nThe Company uses the closing stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of service-based RSUs. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions using the closing stock price on the grant date.\nA summary of RSUs activity is as follows:\nShares (in thousands)\nWeighted - Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2021 - $ -\nGranted 3,676 15.48\nVested (2,513) 15.34\nForfeited (166) 16.00\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 997 $ 15.74\nGranted 3,017 4.20\nVested (877) 10.47\nForfeited (49) 2.10\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 3,088 $ 5.93\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, total recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs was $1.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively, which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs was $16.5 million and $15.5 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting periods of 2.1 years and 1.5 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the maximum contractual term of RSUs is approximately 4.0 years and 3.0 years, respectively.\nRestricted stock awards\nSubject to the terms and provisions of the plan, the Company, may grant shares of restricted stock to service providers in such amounts as the Company, in its sole discretion, will determine. During the period of restriction, service providers holding shares of restricted stock may exercise full voting rights and will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares, unless the Company determines otherwise. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in shares, the shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the shares of restricted stock with respect to which they were paid. The RSAs granted by the Company are subject to service vesting conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total number of shares subject to outstanding RSAs was 360,683 and 116,949, respectively.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of RSAs subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions using the closing stock price on the grant date.\nA summary of RSAs activity is as follows:\nShares (in thousands)\nWeighted - Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2021 - $ -\nGranted 117 14.60\nVested - -\nForfeited - -\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 117 $ 14.60\nGranted 407 4.54\nVested (115) 14.97\nForfeited (48) 5.87\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 361 $ 4.44\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, total recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested RSAs was $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards was $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 0.5 years and 0.4 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the maximum contractual term of the RSAs is one year.\nNon-employee promotional agreements\nLiability classified awards\nAs described in Note 18-Commitments and contingencies, the Company entered into promotional agreements with ABG-Shark, DB Ventures, MJE, and CDP which included RSUs that contain equity-based payments, which have performance, market and service conditions with exception of the DB Ventures RSUs which did not contain market conditions.\nThe Company determined that the RSUs are liability-classified awards that contain both performance (deemed liquidation event, closing of a financing transaction or the public trading of the Companys common stock) and market conditions (achievement of prescribed Company equity values) in order for the units to vest. As of December 31, 2022, the market conditions have not been met on the ABG-Shark and MJE promotional agreements. The Company began recognizing stock-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period when the performance condition was met through the achievement of the IPO on July 15, 2021. The stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs are recognized ratably over the requisite service period in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nEquity-classified awards\nThe promotional agreement with TK included RSAs that contain equity-based payment, which has a service condition. The Company determined that the RSAs granted to TK are equity-based awards that contain a service condition to vest. The stock-based compensation expense related to the RSAs are recognized ratably over the requisite service period in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote 21-Basic and diluted net loss per share\nThe computation of net loss per share and weighted average shares of the Companys common stock outstanding for the periods presented are as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\n(As Restated)\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders-basic and diluted $ (178,799) $ (193,465)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding-basic and diluted 96,363,343 60,195,201\nNet loss per common share:\nBasic and diluted $ (1.86) $ (3.21)\nAnti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted loss per common share:\nUnvested restricted stock units 2,174,727 2,835,019\nUnvested restricted stock awards 247,007 116,949\nStock options to purchase common stock 1,200,051 252,737\nStock warrants 81,489 -\nTotal\n3,703,274 3,204,705\nThe contingently issuable shares in relation to the promotional agreements with ABG-Shark, CDP, and MJE are not included in diluted net loss per share computation as the market conditions for vesting have not been met as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 22-Segment and geographic area information\nThe Companys operating segments align with how the Company manages its business and interacts with its franchisees on a geographic basis. is organized by geographic regions based on the Companys strategy to become a globally recognized brand. has three reportable segments: United States, Australia and Rest of World. The Company refers to United States as the operations in the United States and South America. The Company refers to Australia as the operations in Australia, New Zealand and the immediately surrounding island nations. The Company refers to Rest of World as the operations in locations other than the United States and Australia. The Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) group is comprised of two executive officers, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Subsequent to the Company entering into a Separation Agreement with Adam Gilchrist on July 26, 2022 and Chris Paynes resignation on November 15, 2022, the Company identified a change to the CODM group. On March 29, 2023, Mr. Ben Coates, who was serving as interim Chief Executive Officer since July 24, 2022, stepped down from such role, and Tom Dowd was appointed to succeed him in such role. Further, on July 13, 2023, the Board appointed Patrick Grosso as Interim Chief Financial Officer, in light of the vacancy created by Robert Madores resignation as Interim Chief Financial Officer on July 9, 2023.

The lender group consists of existing stockholders of the Company led by affiliates of KLIM, the investment manager to significant stockholders of the Company and party to the Companys Third Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement. The Subordinated Credit Agreement provides for a $90.0 million, five-and-a-half-year term loan facility (the Term Loan) at an original issue discount of 3.00% payable in kind. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used by the Company to pay down $20.1 million of outstanding amounts owed on the Senior Credit Agreement, to pay down other liabilities of the Company and for general corporate purposes. The obligations under the Subordinated Credit Agreement are secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors.\nOn July 13, 2023, the Company and such affiliates of KLIM entered into an Amendment to the Side Letter (the Amendment) to extend the time period provided to the Company to identify a permanent Chief Financial Officer candidate.\nConsents Under Credit Agreements\nOn each of August 31, 2023, September 15, 2023 and September 29, 2023, the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Approximately $5 million of the proceeds will be used to pay down a portion of the loan outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, the lenders have provided the Company with a delayed draw facility of up to $10 million.\nDepartures and Appointments in Executive Roles\nAs of March 29, 2023, Ben Coates has stepped down from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and will continue his role as a member of our Board of Directors.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Management regularly monitors the Companys internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This assessment was based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), based on the existence of material weaknesses.\nA material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, even appropriate internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nIn connection with managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, management has identified the deficiencies described below that constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. These deficiencies led to material errors in our previously issued financial statements, which in turn led to the restatement of those previously issued financial statements, as described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMaterial Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Continuation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses\nControl Environment\nThe control environment, which is the responsibility of senior management, helps set the tone of the organization (including a commitment to honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior) is an important component affecting how the organization performs financial analysis, accounting, and financial reporting. A proper organizational tone can be promoted through a variety of means, such as policies and codes of ethics, a commitment to hiring competent employees, the manner and content of oral and written communications, and structures that promote and reward openness, strong internal controls, effective governance, and ethical behavior.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company experienced significant turnover in its executive team and continued to experience significant employee turnover in its accounting and financial reporting team. The Companys employee turnover, combined with the lack of entity level controls that comply with the Control Environment principles within the COSO framework, gave rise to the material weaknesses described below.\nNon-Routine Revenue Transactions and Business Process Changes\nAs part of managements evaluation as of December 31, 2022, management evaluated the design and operational effectiveness of the Companys internal controls regarding non-routine revenue transactions and business process changes. This evaluation included whether the Company had an adequate level of precision in the review of non-routine contracts and the appropriate recording of such contracts under GAAP, including the probability of collection, identification of performance obligations, material contingencies in contracts with franchisees and corresponding tracking and recording of inventories and costs of goods sold. Management concluded that the Company has not properly designed or maintained effective controls over the review of non-routine revenue transactions and the identification and assessment of certain business process changes that ensure compliance with GAAP on a timely basis.\nAccounting for Costing of Inventories and Cost of Sales\nThe Companys current process for tracking and costing of inventories is highly manual and time intensive. In addition, the Companys inventory reconciliations are not prepared using a consistent process across geographies that allow it to facilitate a precise review by a qualified professional in a timely manner. Therefore, management has concluded that the Company has not maintained properly designed or maintained effective controls over its accounting for costing of inventories and cost of sales to ensure compliance with GAAP.\nFinancial Close Process\nDue to insufficient internal resources, including as a result of employee turnover in the Companys finance and accounting department, the Company has not been able to implement sufficient control procedures to\nensure timely execution of the financial close process and provide for a sufficient level of precision in managements review. Management has identified the following deficiencies related to the Companys financial close process:\nAccounting and financial close process lacks clearly defined processes and procedures resulting in delays in data collection, reconciliation, and financial reporting;\nManual processes, reconciliations and transaction processing requires additional layers of review and approval;\nComplex transactions with complex accounting rules require an additional level of oversight and precision that is lacking;\nInsufficient resources, including personnel, technologies, and tools, to appropriately assess and review non-routine transactions, including but not limited to impairment of goodwill, adoption of 842, long lived-assets, and revenue transactions; and\nLack of segregation of duties in certain key financial reporting processes and inadequate segregation of duties in key business process controls, including privileged administrative access to the Companys NetSuite platform.\nRemediation Plan for Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nSubsequent to our December 31, 2022 fiscal year end, we began developing a plan to redesign processes and controls to address all of the material weaknesses. Based on the deficiencies identified above, the Company has identified additional processes, procedures and controls as noted below to improve the effectiveness of its internal controls over the financial close process:\nBoard-level direction to senior management to ensure that a proper, consistent tone is communicated throughout the organization, including through changes in personnel and policies;\nEmphasis by the management team of the expectation that previously existing deficiencies will be rectified through implementation of certain processes and controls to ensure strict compliance with GAAP and regulatory requirements;\nHire additional accounting personnel with expertise to review and identify complex agreements and the accounting related to them in compliance with GAAP;\nDevelop, formalize, and implement additional management review controls across the organization in order to add more comprehensive levels of review and approval for significant non-routine transactions;\nImplement control procedures to identify and assess non-routine revenue contracts and business process changes in a timely manner;\nProvide training of standard operating procedures and internal controls to key employees within the revenue and purchasing processes;\nLeverage existing technologies within our NetSuite platform, our ERP system, to track the movement of and costing for our inventories, including implementation of a perpetual inventory system;\nEstablish a more formal process for reconciling inventories in a timely manner across our geographies and create an independent review process by a qualified professional independent of the preparer;\nStandardize our process for costing inventories on a more consistent basis across our geographies leveraging our NetSuite platform;\nOnboarding additional resources and appropriate personnel necessary to effectively implement additional review and analysis procedures;\nEnhancing the use of automation within our accounting system to provide better tracking and more timely reporting of certain processes; and\nEnhancing the Companys controls over the review of journal entries including timely monitoring and review of administrative access granted to employees.\nThe Company believes the actions described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weaknesses. However, management will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and make further changes as appropriate.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than those actions described above, there have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors are described below. Members of each committee will serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors may establish other committees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time. Each committee operates under a written charter, available on our website at https://ir.f45training.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nOur board of directors has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to formalize its governance practices, which serve as a framework within which our board of directors and its committees operate. These principles cover a number of areas, including the role of our board of directors, board composition and leadership structure, director independence, director selection, qualification and election, director compensation, executive sessions, CEO evaluation, succession planning, annual board assessments, board committees, director orientation and continuing education, stockholder engagement and others. A copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines is available on our website at ir.f45training.com.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nIn addition to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board of directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, in addition to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, serve as the foundation for the Companys system of corporate governance. They also provide guidance for maintaining ethical behavior, require that directors and employees comply with applicable laws and regulations, prohibit conflicts of interest and provide mechanisms for reporting violations of the Companys policies and procedures.\nIn the event the Company makes any amendment to, or grants any waiver from, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer that requires disclosure under applicable SEC or NYSE rules, the Company will disclose such amendment or waiver and the reasons therefor on its website at ir.f45training.com.\nDelinquent Section 16 Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our ordinary shares and other equity securities. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with the SEC or written representations that no Form 5 was required, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we believe that our directors, officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities timely filed all reports required under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, except that, due to administrative error, the following reports required under Section 16(a) were filed late: (1) a Form 3 reporting Mr. Davis as an insider of the Company, (2) a Form 4 reporting the grant of restricted stock with respect to Mr. Davis, (3) a Form 4 reporting the withholding of stock to satisfy tax withholding obligation on the vesting of restricted stock with respect to Mr. Grosso in March 2023, (4) a Form 4 reporting the withholding of stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock with respect to Ben Coates, a former director and former Interim Chief Executive Officer, in January 2023, (5) a Form 4 reporting the withholding of stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock with respect to Mr. Coates in February 2023 and (6) a Form 4 reporting the withholding of stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock with respect to Mr. Coates in March 2023.

Base salaries for our named executive officers are established based on the scope of their responsibilities, taking into account relevant experience, internal pay equity, tenure, and other factors deemed relevant.\nAnnual Bonuses\nFor fiscal year 2022, certain of our NEOs were eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus determined as a percentage of base salary based upon the achievement of pre-established corporate performance goals and evaluation of individual performance. The target award opportunity for Messrs. Gilchrist and Payne was 100% of base salary and the target award opportunity for Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Grosso is 75% of base salary. Neither Mr. Gilchrist nor Mr. Payne was eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus payout for the year due to their terminations of employment. As Interim CEO, Mr. Coates was not eligible to participate in the annual incentive bonus plan. For 2022, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Grosso did not receive an annual incentive bonus.\nEquity Incentives\nWe maintain the Training Holdings Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan) pursuant to which we currently grant stock option and restricted stock unit awards to eligible participants.

Gilchrist, Payne, Armstrong, and Grosso. Mr. Armstrongs and Mr. Grossos agreements were amended and restated on July 13, 2023. The Employment Agreements superseded all prior employment agreements and arrangements. The Employment Agreements provide for at-will employment and are for no specified term; provided, however, that if a change in control occurs, the agreement will continue for at least 24 months thereafter. Each executive is (or was, as applicable) entitled to receive an annual base salary (in 2022, $1,200,000 for Mr. Gilchrist, $1,000,000 for Mr. Payne, $600,000 for Mr. Armstrong and $450,000 for Mr. Grosso) and has (or had, as applicable) a target annual bonus opportunity equal to a percentage of base salary (100% for Messrs.

Following the end of the fiscal year, we amended the Employment Agreement for each of Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Grosso to provide, among other things, for a base salary equal to $780,000 and $700,000, respectively.\nOn September 20, 2022, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Coates in connection with his service as the Interim Chief Executive Officer (as amended, the Coates Employment Agreement).

If termination of employment occurs as a result of the executives death or disability, executive (or executives beneficiaries or estate, as the case may be) will be entitled to receive executives target bonus, pro-rated for the length of employment during the year of termination, payable in a lump sum as soon as practicable following such termination. The executives are bound by certain restrictive covenants, including a restriction on competing with the Company for a two-year period following termination of employment.\nUnder the Coates Employment Agreement, in connection with his termination of employment and subject to his execution of a release in favor of the company, Mr. Coates became eligible to receive a cash severance payment in an amount equal to $500,000 and his unvested restricted stock units that were scheduled to vest on March 31, 2023 became vested on the date of termination. Mr. Coates continues to serve as a member of the Board of Directors.\nIn connection with Mr. Gilchrists termination, we entered into a separation agreement with him effective as of July 24, 2022, which had the effect of terminating his Employment Agreement. Pursuant to the separation agreement, Mr. Gilchrist remains available to provide transition services to the extent needed by the Company and Mr. Gilchrist remains on the Board as a Class III, non-employee director. Under the terms of the separation agreement, Mr. Gilchrist is eligible to receive the following payments and benefits, subject to certain agreed conditions set forth in the separation agreement, including a release of claims in favor of the company and compliance with certain restrictive covenants: (i) a one-time cash payment of $4,800,000; (ii) commencing on August 1, 2022, payment by the Company of a 12-month lease of Mr. Gilchrists residence in Florida, with an annual lease amount of up to $1,200,000; (iii) reimbursement for COBRA premiums for Mr. Gilchrist and his covered dependents for up to eighteen months; (iv) relocation expenses up to $20,000; (v) reimbursement of legal fees related to the separation agreement; and (vi) a one-time cash payment of $1,000,000. As a non-employee member of the Board, as of July 24, 2022, Mr. Gilchrist became eligible to receive compensation pursuant to the Companys non-employee director compensation program as described in more detail below.\nOn July 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Employment Agreement with Mr. Payne. Pursuant to the amendment, so long as Mr. Payne remained employed through October 15, 2022, Mr. Payne would become entitled to a cash retention bonus in the amount of $2,400,000, along with accelerated vesting of his outstanding and unvested equity awards, and 18 months of Company-paid COBRA. He would also be eligible for the relocation benefits provided for in his existing Employment Agreement following any termination of employment following that date. The amendment also provided that if Mr. Payne received these retention payments and benefits, he would not be entitled to any additional severance compensation or benefits under his Employment Agreement in connection with any termination of employment with the company. Therefore, in connection with his termination in November 2022, he became entitled to the foregoing benefits in lieu of the severance provisions set forth in his Employment Agreement.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe offer our eligible employees, including our eligible named executive officers, the opportunity to participate in our tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Employees can contribute a percentage of their eligible earnings up to the Internal Revenue Services annual limits on a before-tax basis, which is generally $22,500 for 2023.

The annual restricted stock award vests in full on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant.\nFor any non-employee continuing director that previously received an annual equity award based on the date of the companys previous annual shareholder meeting, that director will receive successive annual grants based on that date rather than the directors date of appointment.\nDirectors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their activities as directors.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation for 2022\nName Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) Stock Awards ($) (1)\nTotal ($)\nEugene Davis(6)\n$ 12,902 $ 200,000 $ 212,902\nAngelo Demasi(2)\n$ 82,500 $ 200,000 $ 282,500\nVanessa Douglas(2)\n$ 50,481 $ 203,180 $ 253,661\nRichard Grellman(3)\n$ 123,750 $ 200,000 $ 323,750\nElizabeth Josefsberg $ 215,000 $ 200,000 $ 415,000\nMichael T.
