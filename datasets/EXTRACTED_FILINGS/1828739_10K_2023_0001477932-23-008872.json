ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nNot Applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n4 | Page\nRESULTS OF OPERATION\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had deficit of $74,505. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.\nYear ended September 30, 2023 compared to year ended September 30, 2022\nRevenue\nDuring year ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated $7,982 in revenue compared to $-0- in revenue during year ended September 30, 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $24,759 and cost of goods sold of $6,525 compared to $32,466 for the year ended September 30, 2022. General and administrative and professional fee expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $23,302 compared to $32,466 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs at September 30, 2023 our total assets were $2,499 compared to $5,676 in total assets at September 30, 2022. As at September 30, 2023, our current liabilities were $45,859 compared to $25,734 as of September 30, 2022.\nStockholders deficit was $43,360 as of September 30, 2023 compared to stockholders equity of $20,058 as of September 30, 2022.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in operating activities was $33,236, consisting of net loss of $23,302, amortization expenses of $66 and decrease in accounts payable of $10,000.

Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.\nExisting working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.\nMATERIAL COMMITMENTS\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.\nPURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT\nWe do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022\nStatements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nStatement of Changes in Stockholders Equity for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nStatements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n-F-8\n7 | Page\nMICHAEL GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC\nCERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS\nVANCOUVER, WA 98666\n206.353.5736\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders & Board of Directors\nAzzurro Solutions Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Azzurro Solutions Corp. as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements) for the periods then ended. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/S/ MICHAEL GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nPCAOB ID: 6108\nVancouver, Washington\nNovember 14, 2023\nAZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nSEPTEMBER 30,\n(AUDITED)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\n(AUDITED)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash & cash equivalents\n$ 565\n$ 5,676\nTotal current assets\n5,676\nNon-current assets\n1,934\n-\nTotal non-current assets\n1,934\n-\nTotal Assets\n$ 2,499\n$ 5,676\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable\n$ -\n$ 10,000\nLoans from related parties\n45,859\n15,734\nTotal current liabilities\n45,859\n25,734\nTotal Liabilities\n45,859\n25,734\nStockholders Equity\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized:\n4,058,167 shares issued and outstanding\n4,058\n4,058\nAdditional Paid-In-Capital\n27,087\n27,087\nAccumulated Deficit\n(74,505 )\n(51,203 )\nTotal Stockholders equity\n(43,360 )\n(20,058 )\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders equity\n$ 2,499\n$ 5,676\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nAZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (AUDITED)\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nYEAR ENDED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nRevenue\n$ 7,982\n$ -\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of goods sold\n6,525\n-\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n24,759\n$ 32,466\nNet loss from operations\n(23,302 )\n(32,466 )\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(23,302 )\n(32,466 )\nProvision for income taxes\n-\n-\nNet income (loss)\n$ (23,302 )\n$ (32,466 )\nIncome (loss) per common share:\nBasic and Diluted\n$ (0.00 )\n$ (0.00 )\nWeighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding:\nBasic and Diluted\n4,058,167\n4,058,167\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nAZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP.\nSTATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (AUDITED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2023\nNumber of\nCommon\nShares\nAmount\nAdditional\nPaid-In -Capital\nAccumulated\nDeficit\nTotal\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n4,058,167\n$ 4,058\n$ 27,087\n$ (18,737 )\n$ 12,408\nNet income (loss)\n-\n-\n-\n(32,466 )\n(32,466 )\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n4,058,167\n$ 4,058\n$ 27,087\n$ (51,203 )\n$ (20,058 )\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n4,058,167\n$ 4,058\n$ 27,087\n$ (51,203 )\n$ (20,058 )\nNet income (loss)\n-\n-\n-\n(23,302 )\n(23,302 )\nBalance as of September 30, 2023\n4,058,167\n$ 4,058\n$ 27,087\n$ (74,505 )\n$ (43,360 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nAZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP.\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (AUDITED)\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nYEAR ENDED\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet loss\n$ (23,302 )\n$ (32,466 )\nAmortization expense\n-\nAccounts payable\n(10,000 )\n10,000\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n(33,236 )\n(22,466 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nComputer Software\n(2,000 )\n-\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(2,000 )\n-\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nProceeds of loan from shareholder\n30,125\n13,964\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n30,125\n13,964\nNet decrease in cash and equivalents\n(5,111 )\n(8,502 )\nCash and equivalents at beginning of the period\n5,676\n14,178\nCash and equivalents at end of the year/ period\n$ 565\n$ 5,676\nSupplemental cash flow information:\nCash paid for:\nInterest\n$ -\n$ -\nTaxes\n$ -\n$ -\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nAZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP.\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (OCTOBER 4, 2019) TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS\nAZZURRO SOLUTIONS CORP. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on October 4, 2019. The Company administrative office is located at V Osik\u00e1ch, 24, Dolni Mecholupy, Prague, Czech Republic 10900. The Company intends to commence operations in the distribution of Bohemian Crystal Chandeliers.\nThe Company has adopted September 30 fiscal year end.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN\nThe Companys financial statements as of September 30, 2023 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated loss from inception (October 4, 2019) to September 30, 2023, of $74,505. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Company functional and operational currency is US Dollar.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At September 30, 2023 the Companys bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees.\nStock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company utilizes the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 related to Income Taxes to account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Topic 740 for Income Taxes clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement and classification in financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be in a tax return. Further, it prescribes a two-step process for the financial statement measurement and recognition of a tax position. The first step involves the determination of whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent likelihood) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step requires that any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold be measured and recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This topic also provides guidance on the accounting for related interest and penalties, financial statement classification and disclosure. The Companys policy is that any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense when incurred. The Company has no uncertain tax positions or related interest or penalties requiring accrual at September 30, 2023.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThere were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC 825, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2023.\nThe respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximate their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and related party loan payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair value.\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45 Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal.\nNOTE 4 - CAPITAL STOCK\nThe Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.\nIn September 2020, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $3,000 and 180,000 shares of its common stock at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $1,800. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 878,167 shares of its common stock at $0.03 per share for total proceeds of $26,345.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had 4,058,167 shares issued and outstanding.\nNOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.\nSince October 4, 2019 (Inception) through September 30, 2023, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $45,859 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. As of September 30, 2023, the amount outstanding was $45,859. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.\nNOTE 6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events from September 30, 2023 to the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are the following items to disclose:\nIn October 2023, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $8,350 to pay for operating expenses. This loans is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms.

Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
