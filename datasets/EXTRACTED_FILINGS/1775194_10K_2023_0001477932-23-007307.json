We have continued to manage these operations with our corporate focus moving towards other larger opportunities and investments for the future.\nIn the United States, hemp products that are manufactured by Upexi are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and various state agencies within the individual States. As an initial matter, the hemp products manufactured and distributed by Upexi must meet the requirements of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (the Farm Bill). Under the Farm Bill, all hemp products must contain no more than 0.3% of 9-delta-tetraydrocannabidiols (9-delta) on a dry weight basis. To ensure compliance with this provision, Upexi requires all hemp products it manufactures and distributes to contain no more than 0.3% of all tetraydrocannabidiols not simply 9-delta. The Farm Bill also requires that Upexi only use hemp [manufacturers/producers] that are duly licensed under state law or pursuant to the regulations issued by the USDA. Consequently, the Company processes, develops, manufactures, and sells its products pursuant to the Farm Bill. CBD products manufactured and distributed by Upexi Inc. must also meet the requirements of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the federal Food and Drug Administrations (the FDA) regulations implementing the FDCA. While neither the FDCA nor FDA has specific provisions that relate to the marketing of hemp products, the products are subject to the general adulteration and labeling provisions of the FDCA and FDAs regulations depending on whether the product is marketed as a cosmetic, dietary supplement or food. The permissibility of hemp products containing cannabinoids remains in a state of flux. The FDA has issued guidance titled FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including Cannabidiol (CBD) pursuant to which the FDA has taken the position that cannabidiol (CBD) is prohibited from use as an ingredient in a food or beverage or as a dietary ingredient in or as a dietary supplement based on several provisions of the FDCA. In the definition of dietary supplement found in the FDCA at Section 201(ff), an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement. A similar provision in the FDCA at 301(ll) makes it a prohibited act to introduce or deliver into commerce any food with a substance that was investigated as a new drug prior to being included in a food. There are no similar exclusions for the use of CBD in non-drug topical products, as long as such products otherwise comply with applicable laws. The FDA created a task force to address the further regulation of CBD and other cannabis-derived products and is currently evaluating the applicable science and pathways for regulating CBD and other cannabis-derived ingredients. Additionally, various states have enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp products. Compliance with state-specific laws and regulations could impact our operations in those specific states. It is important to note that FDA has not taken any specific positions regarding the regulatory status of other cannabinoids, for example CBDA, CBDG, and CBDN. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission is the agency that is vested with ensuring that all marketing claims for hemp products are truthful and non-misleading.\nOur Products\nUpexi is a multi-faceted brand owner with established brands in the health, wellness, pet, beauty and other growing markets. We operate in emerging industries with high growth trends and look to drive organic growth of our current brands. We focus on direct to consumer and Amazon brands that are scalable and have anticipated, high industry growth trends. Our goal is to continue to accumulate consumer data and build out a significant customer database across all industries we sell into. The growth of our current customer database has been key to the year-over-year gains in sales and profits. To drive additional growth, we have and will continue to acquire profitable Amazon and eCommerce businesses that can scale quickly and reduce costs through corporate synergies. We utilize our in-house SaaS programmatic ad technology to help achieve a lower cost per acquisition and accumulate consumer data for increased cross-selling between our growing portfolio of brands.\nThe global ecommerce growth rate for 2022 is forecast at 12.2 percent, bringing global eCommerce sales worldwide to $5.542 trillion. Online shopping trends are expected to grow 50 percent in the U.S. in the next few years. eCommerce sales are forecast to increase by a whopping 50 percent from $907.9 billion in 2022 to $1.4 trillion in 2025. The industry saw exponential growth during the pandemic, as consumers were more apt to buy online than go into stores, but while the CAGR has dipped from 2020, the industry continues to grow steadily.\nThe market, customers and distribution methods for eCommerce products are large and diverse. While Amazon remains the largest eCommerce channel, others are carving out a big chunk of the market, including Walmart, eBay, and Etsy. More opportunities are popping up for sellers as well. Being able to navigate multiple marketplaces is a key to our success and helps reach different demographics and consumers with specific buying behaviors.\nEach of our brands creates new opportunities for us to target additional markets and consumers. Our goal through this diverse portfolio is to create products that can be cross-sold between brands to help take advantage of our growing list of consumer data.\nOur target customers are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales; however, we see growth opportunities in direct-to-consumer retail stores, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe attribute our success to our diverse portfolio of consumer products.\nDiversification of Product Offerings. As an aggregator, our research and development team carefully tracks the growth rates for various consumer products, which serves as the first means of identifying profitable brands that have significant opportunities for scale. While many companies continue to spend on growth at all costs, we have spent to increase our profitability and build a foundation for profits in the toughest of times. We remained patient when other aggregators were over-extending their means which has provided us for better opportunities at more favorable valuations.\nAdvertising Technology. We understand that advertising and consumer data is the key to growth when it comes to any eCommerce business. Our investment in such technology helps lower our advertising costs, while providing a revenue stream from others who we outsource this programmatic SAAS to. This ownership of data allows us to help cross-sell any brand we acquire or launch.\nLogistical Expertise. Our executive team comes from a background in logistics, with CEO, Allan Marshall, the founder of XPO Logistics (formerly known as Segmentz, Inc.). With increased shipping costs affecting online retailers, our strength is understanding this and finding ways to lower our costs and overhead, thus increasing profit margins on all of our products.\nLiquidation Markets. Resellers on and off Amazon represent a significant part of our business, which allows us to use our capital to buy in bulk with quick resale opportunities, whether it be direct Amazon listings or through partnerships with the likes of Walmart, BJs, Costco, Sams Club, etc. As a result, we are able to expand our network, build new relationships, and sell branded products without the added cost of advertising.\nRetail Partnerships. While eCommerce is our direct line of business, we have grown and continue to expand our relationships with big box retailers in order to sell branded products as resellers or to place our in-house brands in those stores. With longstanding accounts that we have taken ownership of through acquisitions, we have grown our network and have untapped additional revenue streams.\nProfessionalism and Entrepreneurial Culture. Our professionalism and entrepreneurial culture fosters highly dedicated employees who provide our customers with unsurpassed customer service. We continue to invest in our talent by providing every employee with an extensive and ongoing education and have successfully developed programs that provide comprehensive product knowledge and the tools needed to have a unique understanding of our customers personalities and decision-making processes.\nExperienced and Proven Management Team Driving Growth through Organic and Accretive Acquisition Opportunities. We believe our management team has extensive experience in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in accounting, mergers and acquisitions, financial services, consumer packaged goods, retail operations and third-party logistics.\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur growth will focus on the expansion of our brand portfolio through organic growth and strategic acquisitions.\nDirect-to-Consumer expansion. Our direct-to-consumer business is expected to be our growth driver for the next several years, driven by acquisitions of profitable Amazon and eCommerce businesses. This allows us to tap into multiple markets and helps us acquire proven brands that are at a stage in their lifecycle when they lack the resources (capital and personnel) to grow rapidly on their own. Our model helps inject those resources into the business in hopes to scale the business efficiently.\nResellers & liquidators. While direct-to-consumer brands represent a major part of our growth, our company has realized the potential of acquiring profitable resellers who sell on/to Amazon, Walmart, Costco, BJs, Sams Club, and more. Our first acquisition in the space, Cygnet Online, sells branded OTC products on Amazon. A letter of intent was signed on August 2, 2022 for the acquisition of E-Core, Inc. and its subsidiaries to further expand this segment of our business. We believe this is a lucrative industry that also helps establish strong, big box retail partnerships.\nTalent acquisition. A large part of our acquisition process is to not only evaluate the brand/product offerings, but to understand the team that has been responsible for its success. In a tough market for hiring, this has proven to be a strategic method for bringing on talent. We not only get a great brand, but look to retain the personnel, often the heartbeat of said brand, give them resources, and even utilize them for other brands that we have launched internally or acquired. We strongly believe that continued success relies on a growing team of experts across various industries.\nAdvertising technology. With online sales increasing, so has the cost of advertising. Our in-house, programmatic advertising technology, Interactive Offers, not only acts as a revenue stream for our business, but provides us with endless research, consumer data, and allows us to achieve lower advertising costs for our brands. The business has a growing list of publishers and advertisers who also utilize our technology to monetize their data, achieve better CPMs, and even increase their average order values.\nInternational expansion. Our primary focus has been on the U.S. eCommerce market which, as mentioned, is forecasted to grow stronger than others. However, with recently acquired brands and their presence in international markets, we expect nearly all of our products to be offered worldwide over the next few years.\nAcquiring aggregators. The aggregation craze took off in 2019 to 2020, but many found themselves overpaying for brands and not being able to support the growth they had forecasted. Recently, these aggregators have been looking for funding and/or selling their assets. We seek to take advantage of this opportunity to bring on additional brands and talent that, for better or worse, were overwhelmed and unprepared.\nCompetition\nThere is heavy competition in the aggregation market, but each company seems to be trying to carve their own niche in the space. We compete against several national and international companies, most of which have substantially greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known and funded, private companies. Our goal is never to compete against these aggregators, but to do our own research, focus on profitability, and grow efficiently, rather than overextend ourselves and pay up for valuations that dont make sense.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These laws and regulations affect the Companys activities in areas, including, but not limited to, the hemp business in the United States, the consumer products and nutritional supplement markets in the United States, consumer protection, labor, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, federal and state healthcare, environmental and safety. The successful execution of our business objectives will be contingent upon our compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, permits and registrations, which may be onerous and expensive. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in such applicable laws and regulations and the expansion of the Companys business, could make our products less attractive to our customers, delay the introduction of new products, and require the Company to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nWe operate our business in markets that are both highly regulated and rapidly evolving. We are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations affecting the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and sale of food, beverages, dietary supplements, and personal care products/cosmetics, as well as the use of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients like CBD in such products. The FDA regulates hemp and hemp-derived ingredients in FDA-regulated products pursuant to the provisions of the FDCA and regulations promulgated pursuant to it, in particular those related to adulteration and labeling of cosmetic, food, and dietary supplements. The FDA has issued guidance on the subject and issued letters to companies regarding claims made for products and the use of such ingredients in various products. The FDA also initiated a task force to evaluate pathways for further regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients. At various times, bills pertaining to the regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients have been introduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and additional proposed legislation is expected to be introduced in the future to clarify the regulatory status of cannabinoids from hemp generally and CBD generally. Future legislation approved by Congress and signed by the President, or rulemaking promulgated by the FDA, could either positively or adversely impact the future sale of products by the Company.\nWe are currently not subject to any foreign regulations as we do not currently distribute or export any products, including hemp or CBD related products outside the U.S. Additionally, we are not aware of any foreign regulations that we had to comply with in regard to the sale of our flavoring products to one end user customer in the U.S. who distributed such products to Europe where it had operations. The responsibility for compliance with any European regulations would be on such customer.\nAdditionally, numerous states have passed forms of hemp legislation governing the cultivation of hemp, as well as the further processing and sale of hemp and products with hemp or hemp-derived ingredients. Those states that have not yet enacted laws or issued regulations pertaining to hemp and hemp-derived ingredients may do so in the near future. Unless Congress specifically enacts laws preempting the state regulations of hemp products, we will continue to be subject not only to federal law but various state laws. Presently, Upexi and only distributes hemp-products in states that it is legal to do so. Changes in the state laws and regulations could again either positively or adversely affect our ability to sell products in those states.\nEmployees\nThe Company has 95 full-time employees working out of its headquarters in Tampa Florida, its Henderson, Nevada, manufacturing facility, its offices and distribution warehouses in Southern Florida or individuals home-based offices.\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\nYou are advised to read this Form 10-K in conjunction with other reports and documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. You may obtain copies of these reports directly from us or from the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F. Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549, and you may obtain information about obtaining access to the Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains information for electronic filers at its website http://www.sec.gov. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. See also Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business prospects and management.\nThe Company was incorporated on September 5, 2018 and only commenced operations thereafter. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. Operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we cannot assure you that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nThe Companys prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Future operating results will depend upon many factors, including our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, our ability to establish short term credit lines or obtain financing from other sources, such as this Offering, our ability to develop and market new products, our ability to control costs, and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that the Company will successfully address any of these risks. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain appropriate intellectual property protection in the United States and foreign countries with respect to our proprietary formulations and products. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends on our ability to build and maintain brand recognition using trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other intellectual property. We may rely on trade secret, trademark, patent and copyright laws, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken and the steps we will take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are unsuccessful or inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. Protecting against unauthorized use of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may be expensive, difficult and in some cases not possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage growth.\nAs we continue to grow our business and develop products, we expect to need additional research, development, managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, accounting, legal and other resources. The Company expects its growth to place a substantial strain on its managerial, operational and financial resources. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations, or that its facilities, systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support its operations. The Companys inability to manage future growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management may not be able to control costs in an effective or timely manner.\nThe Companys management has made reasonable efforts to assess, predict and control costs and expenses. However, the Company only has a brief operating history upon which to base those efforts. Implementing our business plan may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than management has predicted. Likewise, the cost of compensating employees and consultants or other operating costs may be higher than managements estimates, which could lead to sustained losses.\nWe expect our quarterly financial results to fluctuate.\nWe expect our net sales and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including changes in:\n\u00b7\nDemand for our products;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to obtain and retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to manage our product inventory;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions, both domestically and in foreign markets;\n\u00b7\nAdvertising and other marketing costs; and\n\u00b7\nCosts of creating and expanding product lines.\nAs a result of the variability of these and other factors, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of our stockholders.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of U.S. federal securities laws, which can be expensive.\nWe will be subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited financial statements to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we had remained privately held. In addition, it may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures.\nCybersecurity breaches of our IT systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers, delay our ability to recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.\nWe increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security, or that of our website, and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service. Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third-party contractors, including our manufacturers and logistics providers, and our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of our contractors own cybersecurity measures. Similarly, we rely upon distributors, resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend, in part, on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures. Additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyberattacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\nWe may incur significant costs and require significant management resources to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any failure to comply or any adverse result from such evaluation may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we will be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404) and to include an internal control report beginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022. This report must include managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. Failure to comply, or any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could harm our business.\nWe may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such an increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased prices for our products.\nOur failure to meet the continuing listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our securities.\nIf, after this offering, we fail to satisfy the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ, such as the corporate governance, stockholders equity or minimum closing bid price requirements, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would likely take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQs listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our securities, prevent our Common Stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQs listing requirements.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ. In addition, our management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company. We expect complying with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products. Additionally, if these requirements divert our managements attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a public company, we also expect that it may be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nWe are eligible to be treated as an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this annual report and our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in this annual report. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any December 31 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, after which, in each case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately.\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior the end of our second fiscal quarter ending December 31 of each year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior to the end of our second fiscal quarter ending December 31 of each year. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nAfter we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, and if we are unable to compete with our competitors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competition includes all other companies that are in the business of producing or distributing hemp-based products for personal use or consumption. Many of our competitors have greater resources that may enable them to compete more effectively than us in the CBD industry. Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater capital resources, facilities and product line diversity, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. Our competitors may devote their resources to developing and marketing products that will directly compete with our product lines. The Company expects to face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants. If a significant number of new entrants enters the market in the near term, the Company may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward pricing pressure on the Companys products as new entrants increase production. Such competition may cause us to encounter difficulties in generating revenues and market share, and in positioning our products in the market. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, our lack of competitive advantage will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products or similar products developed and distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which could result in decreased sales and fluctuations in our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on consumer perception regarding the safety and quality of our products, as well as similar products marketed and distributed by other companies. Consumer perception of hemp-based products can be significantly influenced by adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, national media attention or other publicity, which may associate consumption of our products or other similar products with adverse effects or question the benefits and/or effectiveness of our products or similar products. A new product may initially be received favorably, resulting in high sales of that product, but that level of sales may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change over time. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or any of our particular products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Unfavorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales.\nOur failure to appropriately and timely respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Our failure to accurately predict or react to these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of us as a source for the latest products, which in turn could harm our customer relationships and cause us to lose market share. The success of our product offerings depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nAnticipate customer needs;\n\u00b7\nInnovate and develop new products;\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully introduce new products in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nPrice our products competitively with retail and online competitors;\n\u00b7\nDeliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u00b7\nDifferentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIf we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely manner, some of our products could be rendered obsolete, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments and partnerships could be difficult to identify and integrate with our business, disrupt our business, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may seek to acquire or invest in businesses and product lines that we believe could complement or expand our product offerings, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not the acquisitions are completed. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, if an acquired business or product line fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFailure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and their products and other assets into our Company, or if integrated, failure to further our business strategy, may result in our inability to realize any benefit from such acquisition.\nWe expect to grow by acquiring relevant businesses, including other cannabis-related businesses. The consummation and integration of any acquired business, product or other assets into our Company may be complex and time consuming and, if such businesses and assets are not successfully integrated, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, cost-savings or growth opportunities. Furthermore, these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose our Company to increased competition or other challenges with respect to our products or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business, technology or other asset or arrangement.\nThe failure to attract and retain key employees could hurt our business.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain numerous highly qualified employees. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or consultants could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We face competition for personnel and consultants from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Our failure to attract and retain skilled management and employees may prevent or delay us from pursuing certain opportunities. If we fail to successfully fill many management roles, fail to fully integrate new members of our management team, lose the services of key personnel, or fail to attract additional qualified personnel, it will be significantly more difficult for us to achieve our growth strategies and success.\nWe have limited supply sources, and price increases or supply shortages of key raw materials could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are composed of certain key raw materials. If the prices of such raw materials increase significantly, it could result in a significant increase in our product development costs. If raw material prices increase in the future, we may not be able to pass on such price increases to our customers. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its continued success will depend upon the availability of raw materials that permit the Company to meet its labeling claims and quality control standards. The supply of our industrial hemp is subject to the same risks normally associated with agricultural production, such as climactic conditions, insect infestations and availability of manual labor or equipment for harvesting. Any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could substantially increase the cost of such materials, could require product reformulations, the qualification of new suppliers and repackaging and could result in a substantial reduction or termination by the Company of its sales of certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the disruption of the Companys supply sources will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nLoss of key contracts with our suppliers, renegotiation of such agreements on less favorable terms or other actions these third parties may take could harm our business.\nMost of our agreements with suppliers of our industrial hemp, including our key supplier contract, are short term. The loss of these agreements, or the renegotiation of these agreements on less favorable economic or other terms, could limit our ability to procure raw material to manufacture our products. This could negatively affect our ability to meet consumer demand for our products. Upon expiration or termination of these agreements, our competitors may be able to secure industrial hemp from our existing suppliers which will put the company at a competitive disadvantage in the market.\nLoss of key customers could harm our business.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, a significant portion of our sales were to two large customers, but we do not have contracts for future purchases in place with either of these customers. As such, we do not have any purchase commitments from these customers, and there can be no assurance that they will continue to purchase our products. If these customers do not purchase our products in the future, and we are not able to generate a similar volume of sales from other customers, it could have a material effect on our total sales and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business.\nThere is limited availability of clinical studies.\nAlthough hemp plants have a long history of human consumption, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these innovative product ingredients or combinations thereof in concentrated form. Although the Company performs research and/or tests the formulation and production of its products, there is limited clinical data regarding the safety and benefits of ingesting industrial hemp-based products. Any instance of illness or negative side effects of ingesting industrial hemp-based products would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe face substantial risk of product liability claims and potential adverse product publicity.\nLike any other retailer, distributor or manufacturer of products that are designed to be ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused loss or injury. In the event we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification, product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company is not currently a named defendant in any product liability lawsuit; however, other manufacturers and distributors of hemp-based products currently are or have been named as defendants in such lawsuits. The successful assertion or settlement of any uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims, or a claim exceeding the Companys insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain independent distributors for our products.\nAs a direct selling company, our revenue depends in part upon the number and productivity of our independent distributors. Like most direct selling companies, we experience high levels of turnover among our independent distributors from year to year, who may terminate their service at any time. Generally, we need to increase the productivity of our independent distributors and/or retain existing independent distributors and attract additional independent distributors to maintain and/or increase product sales. Many factors affect our ability to attract and retain independent distributors, including the following:\n\u00b7\npublicity regarding our Company, our products, our distribution channels and our competitors;\n\u00b7\npublic perceptions regarding the value and efficacy of our products;\n\u00b7\nongoing motivation of our independent distributors;\n\u00b7\ngovernment regulations;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nour compensation arrangements, training and support for our independent distributors; and\n\u00b7\ncompetition in the market.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if our independent distributors are unable to maintain their current levels of productivity, or if we are unable to retain existing distributors and attract new distributors in sufficient numbers to maintain present sales levels and sustain future growth.\nWe could incur obligations resulting from the activities of our independent distributors.\nWe sell our products through a network of independent distributors. Independent distributors are independent contractors who operate their own business separate and apart from the Company. We may not be able to control certain aspects of our distributors activities that may impact our business. If local laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof, change and require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or if our independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including employment-related taxes and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the possibility that some jurisdictions may seek to hold us responsible for false product or earnings-related claims due to the actions of our independent distributors. Liability for any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our independent distributors failure to comply with applicable advertising laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe advertisement of our products is subject to extensive regulations in the markets in which we do business. Our independent distributors may fail to comply with such regulations governing the advertising of our products. We cannot ensure that all marketing materials used by our independent distributors comply with applicable regulations, including bans on false or misleading product and earnings-related claims. If our independent distributors fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subjected to claims of false advertising, misrepresentation, significant financial penalties, and/or costly mandatory product recalls and relabeling requirements with respect to our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the CBD Industry\nLaws and regulations affecting the CBD industry are evolving under the Farm Bill, and changes to applicable regulations may materially affect our future operations in the CBD market.\nThe CBD used by the Company is derived from hemp as defined in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (United States) (the Farm Bill ) and codified at 7 USC 1639o means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. The Cannabis sativa plant and its derivatives may also be deemed marijuana, depending on certain factors. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and is defined in the Federal Controlled Substances Act at 21 USC Section 802(16) as all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Exemptions to that definition provided in 21 USC Section 802(16) include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination or hemp as defined in 7 USC 1639o.\nSubstances meeting the definition of hemp in the Farm Bill and 7 USC 1639o may be used in clinical studies and research through an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA). Substances scheduled as controlled substances, like marijuana, require more rigorous regulation, including interaction with several agencies including the FDA, the DEA, and the NIDA within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nAccordingly, if the CBD used by the Company is deemed marijuana and, therefore, a Schedule I controlled substance, the Company could be subject to significant additional regulation, as well as enforcement actions and penalties pertaining to the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and any resulting liability could require the Company to modify or cease its operations.\nFurthermore, in conjunction with the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD use in food and dietary supplements, noting that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDAs authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Any difficulties we experience in complying with existing and/or new government regulation could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our results of operations in future periods. The FDA has issued guidance titled FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including Cannabidiol (CBD) pursuant to which the FDA has taken the position that CBD is prohibited from use as an ingredient in a food or beverage or as a dietary ingredient in or as a dietary supplement based on several provisions of the FDCA. In the definition of dietary supplement found in the FDCA at 201(ff), an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement. A similar provision in the FDCA 301(ll) makes it a prohibited act to introduce or deliver into commerce any food with a substance that was investigated as a new drug prior to being included in a food. There are no similar exclusions for the use of CBD in non-drug topical products, as long as such products otherwise comply with applicable laws. The FDA created a task force to address the further regulation of CBD and other cannabis-derived products and is currently evaluating the applicable science and pathways for regulating CBD and other cannabis-derived ingredients.\nAs a result of the Farm Bills recent passage, we expect that there will be a constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the CBD industry which could affect the Companys plan of operations. Local, state and federal hemp laws and regulations may be broad in scope and subject to changing interpretations. These changes may require us to incur substantial costs associated with legal compliance and may ultimately require us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations of these laws, or alleged violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business.\nChanges to state laws pertaining to industrial hemp could slow the use of industrial hemp, which could impact our revenues in future periods. Approximately 40 states have authorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the Farm Bill. Additionally, various states have enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp products. Compliance with state-specific laws and regulations could impact our operations in those specific states. Continued development of the industrial hemp industry will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp at the state level, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp industry is currently encouraging, growth is not assured, and while there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests.\nUnfavorable interpretations of laws governing hemp processing activities could subject us to enforcement or other legal proceedings and limit our business and prospects.\nThere are no express protections in the United States under applicable federal or state law for possessing or processing hemp biomass derived from lawful hemp not exceeding 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis and intended for use in finished product, but that may temporarily exceed 0.3% THC during the interim processing stages. While it is a common occurrence for hemp biomass to have variance in THC content during interim processing stages after cultivation but prior to use in finished products, there is risk that state or federal regulators or law enforcement could take the position that such hemp biomass is a Schedule I controlled substance in violation of the CSA and similar state laws. In the event that the Companys operations are deemed to violate any laws, the Company could be subject to enforcement actions and penalties, and any resulting liability could cause the Company to modify or cease its operations.\nCosts associated with compliance with various laws and regulations could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe manufacture, labeling and distribution of CBD products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict our ability to market CBD-based products in the future. The FDA regulates our products to ensure that the products are not adulterated or misbranded. We may also be subject to regulation by other federal, state and local agencies with respect to our CBD-based products. Our advertising activities are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC and state attorneys general have initiated numerous investigations of dietary and nutritional supplement companies and products. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe shifting regulatory environment necessitates building and maintaining of robust systems to achieve and maintain compliance in multiple jurisdictions and increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the legal requirements applicable to our business and products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, injunctions, or product withdrawals, recalls or seizures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty caused by potential changes to legal regulations could impact the use and acceptance of CBD products.\nThere is substantial uncertainty and differing interpretations and opinions among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids and the Controlled Substances Act. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the DEA and/or the FDA, and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The existing uncertainties in the CBD regulatory landscape in the United States cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps state-level, legislation and regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing laws and regulations. If these uncertainties are not resolved in the near future or are resolved in the manner inconsistent with our business plan, such uncertainties may have an adverse effect upon our plan of operations and the introduction of our CBD-based products in different markets.\nIf we fail to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals under applicable laws and regulations, our business and plan of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses and regulatory approvals in the jurisdictions where we sell or plan to sell our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any necessary licenses, permits or approvals. Any material delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, such licenses, permits and approvals is likely to delay and/or inhibit our ability to carry out our plan of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential future international expansion of our business could expose us to additional regulatory risks and compliance costs.\nAlthough we have no plans to expand internationally for at least two or more years, if the Company intends to expand internationally or engage in the international sale of its products, it will become subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates, or in which it imports or exports products or materials, including, but not limited to, customs regulations in the importing and exporting countries. The varying laws and rapidly changing regulations may impact the Companys operations and ability to ensure compliance. In addition, the Company may avail itself of proposed legislative changes in certain jurisdictions to expand its product portfolio, which expansion may include unknown business and regulatory compliance risks. Failure by the Company to comply with the evolving regulatory framework in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for health and wellness products is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively in the market, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for CBD products is a competitive and rapidly evolving market. There are numerous competitors in the industry, some of whom are more well-established with longer operating histories and greater financial resources than the Company. We expect competition to continue to intensify following the recent passage of the Farm Bill. We believe the Company will be able to compete effectively because of the quality of our products and customer service. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will effectively compete with existing or future competitors. Increased competition may also drive the prices of our products down, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nGiven the rapid changes affecting the global, national and regional economies generally, the Company may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The Companys success will depend on our ability to keep pace with any changes in such markets, especially legal and regulatory changes. Our success will depend on our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nOur executive and corporate offices are located at 3030 North Rocky Point Drive, Suite 420, Tampa, Florida 33607.

Other sources of revenue and related costs are aggregated and viewed by management as immaterial or have similar economic characteristics, products, production, distribution processes and regulatory environment as the other product sales.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended June 30, 2023, as compared to June 30, 2022:\nThe following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, which are included herein.\nJune,\nChange\nRevenue\n$ 80,676,509\n$ 23,065,344\n$ 57,611,165\nCost of revenue\n$ 47,118,189\n$ 8,195,734\n$ 38,922,455\nSales and marketing expenses\n$ 10,376,003\n$ 5,116,868\n$ 5,259,135\nDistribution costs\n$ 12,369,903\n$ 2,214,322\n$ 10,155,581\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$ 9,546,188\n$ 9,141,667\n$ 404,521\nOther operating expenses\n$ 8,818,233\n$ 4,885,883\n$ 3,932,350\nOther (expense) income\n$ (10,919,488 )\n$ 101,082\n$ (11,020,570 )\nNet (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest\n$ 559,967\n$ (54,820 )\n$ 614,787\nDiscontinued operations\n$ (2,068,054 )\n$ 3,823,621\n$ (5,891,675 )\nNet loss attributable to Upexi, Inc.\n$ (16,930,289 )\n$ (2,100,850 )\n$ (14,182,442 )\nRevenues increased by $57,611,165 or 250% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. $41,041,341 or 71% of the increase was related to the acquisitions of the LuckyTail brand and E-Core Technology, Inc. (2023 acquisitions) during 2023 and $18,848,230 or 33% was related to the acquisitions of Cygnet Online, LLC and VitaMedica, Inc. (2022 acquisitions) compared to the prior year period. This was offset by a decline in other businesses of $2,278,475 or 4%. Our primary brands of VitaMedica, LuckyTail and newly acquired Tytan Tiles all had significant growth year over year and management will continue to focus on these high margin and growth potential business in 2024 and beyond. The recommerce businesses, E-Core Technology, Inc. and Cygnet Online, LLC, continue to represent a significant portion of the overall revenue of the Company, although we did see lower than expected sales volume from our Amazon sales channels. Management expects revenue to continue to increase in the 2024 fiscal year with a primary focus on growing our branded products.\nCost of revenue increased by $38,922,455 or 475% compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. $31,144,149 or 80% of the increase was related to the 2023 acquisitions and $8,640,033 or 22% was related to the 2022 acquisitions. The gross profit increased by $18,688,710. The gross profit margin declined by 22% to 42% compared to 64% in the prior year. The decline in gross profit margin was primarily related to the sales from the recommerce business versus the sales of our branded products. Management expects the gross margin to improve as the branded products segment continues to grow as a percentage of the overall sales and as we continue to gain economies of scale in our purchasing of products.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $5,259,135 or 103% compared with the same period last year. $2,396,876 or 46% of the increase was related to the 2023 acquisitions and $1,373,733 or 26% was related to the 2022 acquisitions. There was an increase of $1,488,526 or 28% related to the other business. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to the acquisitions and increased expenditures for brand and company awareness, however management has aligned the marketing expenditures with the expected growth strategy to decrease the overall percentage of sales and marketing costs to sales. We anticipate our advertising expenses will continue to fluctuate in the following quarters as we fully implement our overall brand marketing strategy.\nDistribution costs increased $10,155,581 or 459% compared with the same period last year. $1,850,306 or 18% of the increase was related to the 2023 acquisitions and $7,306,309 or 72% of the increase was related to the 2022 acquisitions and the rest of the business. There continue to be increases in transportation costs and third-party provider rates. Management has implemented a strategy to change promotions, increase prices and adjust packaging to decrease the overall percentage of distribution costs to sales and is in process of consolidating its distribution centers, including closing the California facility as of July 1, 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $404,521 or 4% compared with the same period last year. General and administrative expenses increased by $2,332,690 from 2023 acquisitions with the remainder of the business had a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1,928,169. Management has actively been reducing general and administrative costs by consolidation of administrative functions and capitalizing on the overall size of the Company. Management will continue to implement strategies to decrease the percentage of general and administrative costs when compared to total sales.\nOther operating expenses increased by $3,932,350 or 80% compared with the same period last year. These expenses are primarily non-cash and increase based on the intangible assets created with acquisitions and the continued amortization of stock compensation. $1,612,815 or 41% was related to the 2023 acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and $1,616,188 or 41% of the increase was related to the 2022 acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets. The remaining increase of $703,347 was related to increases in stock-based compensation and depreciation.\nOther expenses increased by $11,020,570, which was primarily the loss recognized on the sale of Infusionz and select CBD assets, the reserves against amounts owed to the Company by the buyers of that business, the impairment of Interactive Offers intangible assets and an increase of interest expense from both acquisition debt and the termination of a $15,000,000 senior secured debt facility on October 1, 2022. Management estimates based on the current and expected debt balances in fiscal year 2024 that interest expense will be less than $2,800,000 and cash paid for interest expense to be less than $1,400,000.\nThe Company had a net loss of $16,930,289 compared to a net loss of $2,100,850 in the prior year. The decrease in the net losses primarily related to the above-mentioned changes, which was offset by the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of our consolidated subsidiary.\nOperating Segments\nThe Companys financial reporting is organized into two segments: Our Branded Product segment and our Recommerce segment. Our Branded Product segment is focused on the development, growth and distribution of the branded products that we own. Our Recommerce segment is focused on the purchase and sale of new and used products through channels such as Amazon and wholesale distributors. Other sources of revenue and related costs are aggregated and viewed by management as immaterial or have similar economic characteristics, products, production, distribution processes and regulatory environment as the other product sales.\nSegment Information\nThe Company provides the following segments: (a) branded product segment and (b) product distribution segment.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023:\nBranded Products\nRecommerce\nTotal\nRevenue\n$ 26,526,385\n$ 54,150,124\n$ 80,676,509\nLoss from operations\n$ (6,945,411 )\n$ (606,596 )\n$ (7,552,007 )\nOther (expense)\n$ (10,378,183 )\n$ (541,305 )\n$ (10,919,488 )\nDepreciation expense\n$ 944,704\n$ -\n$ 944,704\nIncome tax benefit\n$ 3,049,293\n$ -\n$ 3,049,293\nSegment assets:\nAdditions to property, plant, and equipment\n$ 1,078,264\n$ -\n$ 1,078,264\nTotal assets\n$ 28,588,365\n$ 35,264,702\n$ 63,853,067\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nAs of\nJune 30, 2023\nAs of\nJune 30, 2022\nCurrent assets\n$ 25,455,714\n$ 17,061,622\nCurrent liabilities\n$ 19,606,010\n$ 10,127,748\nWorking capital\n$ 5,849,291\n$ 6,933,874\nCash Flows\nYears Ended June 30,\nCash flows provided by operating activities - continuing operations\n$ 517,697\n$ 715,150\nCash flows used in investing activities - continuing operations\n(2,574,858 )\n(10,903,318 )\nCash flows used in financing activities - continuing operations\n(285,333 )\n3,699,744\nCash flows used by operating activities - discontinued operations\n(315,021 )\n(895,981 )\nCash flows provided by (used by) investing activities - discontinued operations\n-\n-\nCash flows provided by (used by) financing activities - discontinued operations\n-\n-\nNet decrease in cash during the period\n$ (2,657,515 )\n$ (7,384,405 )\nOn June 30, 2023, the Company had cash of $4,492,291 or a decrease of $2,657,515 from June 30, 2022.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Company to the sellers cash consideration and equity instruments issued. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\nGoodwill - The Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment, simplifying the test for goodwill Impairment at least annually and when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company performed its annual test as of June 30, 2023. No impairment charge was identified in connection with the annual goodwill impairment test\nRevenue Recognition - The Company analyzes its contracts and purchase orders to assess that revenue is properly recognized. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, whether for goods and services or licensing, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company acts as a principal in its revenue transactions as the Company is the primary obligor in the transactions. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for its products when ownership is transferred to the customer, provided no significant obligations remain and collection is probable.\nProduct Revenue - Most of the Companys revenue contracts are from domestic sales and represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of its products. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on the Companys selling list price, which is then reduced by estimated costs for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts used to incentivize sales growth and build brand awareness.\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product is transferred to the customer, which is upon shipment to the customer or other customer-designated delivery point. Taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental agencies are accounted for on a net basis and not included as revenue.\nThe Company does not accept sales returns from wholesale customers, as the products are pre-approved prior to production and shipment. E-Commerce product returns must be completed within 45 days of the date of purchase. The Company does not accrue for estimated sales returns as historical sales returns have been minimal. The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable. Substantially all the deferred revenue as of June 30, 2022 was recognized as revenue in the year ended June 30, 2023.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in revenue. Shipping and handling fees associated with freight are generally included in cost of revenue.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment indicators exist, the Company estimates the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether or not the asset values are recoverable. The Company did not recognize impairment on its long-lived assets during the years ended June 30, 2023, or 2022.\nStock Based Compensation - The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) or immediately if the share-based payments vest immediately.\nInventory - The Company reviews the inventory level of all products and raw materials quarterly. For most products that have been in the market for one year or greater, we consider inventory levels of greater than one years sales to be excess or other items that show slower than projected sales. Due to limited market penetration for our products, we have decided to write down 50% of the cost against certain raw materials and finished products. Products that are no longer part of the current product offering are considered obsolete. The potential for re-sale of slow-moving and obsolete inventories is based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The recorded cost of obsolete inventories is then reduced to zero and the slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written off and are recorded as charges to cost of goods sold. All adjustments for obsolete inventory establish a new cost basis for that inventory as we believe such reductions are permanent declines in the market price of our products. Generally, obsolete inventory is sold to companies that specialize in the liquidation, while we continue to market slow-moving inventories until they are sold or become obsolete. As obsolete or slow-moving inventory is sold or disposed of, we write it off.\nNon-GAAP Measures (unaudited)\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Net Loss)\nYear Ended June 30,\nNet income (Net loss) GAAP\n$ (16,930,289 )\n$ (2,100,850 )\nIncome tax\n(3,049,293 )\n(518,398 )\nInterest expense, net\n4,761,903\n202,120\nDepreciation and amortization\n5,153,695\n1,554,297\nStock compensation\n3,664,538\n3,331,586\nLoss on the sale of Infusionz and select assets\n2,212,542\n-\nChange in derivative liability\n(1,770 )\n3,293\nLoss (gain) on discontinued operations\n2,068,054\n(3,823,621 )\nGain on SBA PPP loan forgiveness\n-\n(300,995 )\n(Loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest\n(559,967 )\n54,820\nLease impairment, California facility\n200,512\n-\nGain on sale of asset\n-\n(5,500 )\nImpairment of Intangible assets\n3,746,301\n-\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,266,226\n$ (1,603,248 )\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company discloses and uses the above-mentioned non-GAAP financial measures internally as a supplement to GAAP financial information to evaluate its operating performance, for financial planning purposes, to establish operational goals, for compensation plans, to measure debt service capability, for capital expenditure planning and to determine working capital needs and believes that these are useful financial measures also used by investors. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income or net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for the non-cash stock compensation and stock option expense, acquisition, integration & restructuring expenses, charges and gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and other non-cash items. Non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA are not terms defined by GAAP and, as a result, the Companys measure of non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance, financial position, or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to net income or net loss as reported for GAAP on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, cash and cash flows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and as reflected on the Companys financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for or presented in lieu of financial measures provided by GAAP and all measures and disclosures of financial information pursuant to GAAP should be read to obtain a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the Companys financial results. The reconciliations of non-GAAP EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to GAAP operating income (loss) and/or GAAP net income (net loss) referred to in the highlights or elsewhere are provided in the schedules that are a part of this document.

(the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Upexi, Inc. as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ B F Borgers CPA PC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nLakewood, Colorado\nOctober 2, 2023\nPCAOB ID Number 5041\nUPEXI, INC.\nCONSOLDIATED BALANCE SHEETS\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash\n$ 4,492,291\n$ 7,149,806\nAccounts receivable\n7,163,564\n939,875\nInventory\n11,557,128\n4,725,685\nDue from Bloomios\n845,443\n-\nDeferred tax asset, current\n-\n462,070\nPrepaid expenses and other receivables\n1,307,299\n760,900\nCurrent assets of discontinued operations\n89,989\n3,023,286\nTotal current assets\n25,455,714\n17,061,622\nProperty and equipment, net\n7,526,463\n7,338,866\nIntangible assets, net\n13,571,960\n8,755,012\nGoodwill\n10,251,281\n4,644,609\nDeferred tax asset\n5,604,056\n2,002,759\nOther assets\n96,728\n75,613\nAssets held for sale\n936,054\n7,767,698\nRight-of-use asset\n410,811\n844,856\nTotal other assets\n38,397,353\n31,429,413\nTotal assets\n$ 63,853,067\n$ 48,491,035\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable\n$ 3,969,746\n$ 1,572,275\nAccrued compensation\n533,842\n489,712\nAccrued liabilities\n3,365,562\n816,632\nCurrent portion of notes payable\n2,731,377\n749,752\nCurrent portion of convertible notes payable\n1,254,167\n3,125,000\nCurrent portion of acquisition note payable\n5,656,620\n1,550,000\nLine of Credit\n882,845\n-\nCurrent portion of operating lease payable\n419,443\n183,881\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations\n792,408\n1,640,496\nTotal current liabilities\n19,606,010\n10,127,748\nOperating lease payable, net of current portion\n163,359\n700,411\nConvertible notes payable\n895,833\n3,180,406\nAcquisition notes payable, net of current\n7,605,085\n-\nNotes payable, net of current portion\n7,746,157\n5,695,726\nTotal long-term liabilities\n16,410,434\n9,576,543\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' equity\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized, and 500,000 and 500,000 shares issued and outstanding, respectively\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, 100,000,000 shares authorized, and 20,215,961 and 16,713,345 shares issued and outstanding, respectively\n20,216\n16,713\nAdditional paid in capital\n51,522,229\n34,985,597\nAccumulated deficit\n(23,201,175 )\n(6,270,886 )\nTotal stockholders' equity attributable to Upexi, Inc.\n28,341,770\n28,731,924\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiary\n(505,147 )\n54,820\nTotal stockholders'' equity\n27,836,623\n28,786,744\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$ 63,853,067\n$ 48,491,035\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nUPEXI, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended June 30,\nRevenue\nRevenue\n$ 80,676,509\n$ 23,065,344\nCost of Revenue\n47,118,189\n8,195,735\nGross profit\n33,558,320\n14,869,609\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing\n10,376,003\n5,116,868\nDistribution costs\n12,369,903\n2,214,322\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n9,546,188\n9,141,667\nShare-based compensation\n3,664,538\n3,331,586\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n4,208,991\n979,988\nDepreciation\n944,704\n574,309\n41,110,327\n21,358,740\nLoss from operations\n(7,552,007 )\n(6,489,131 )\nOther income (expense), net\nInterest (expense) income, net\n(4,761,903 )\n(202,120 )\nChange in derivative liability\n1,770\n(3,293 )\nLoss on sale of Infusionz and select assets\n(2,212,542 )\n-\nImpairment of Interactive Offers intangible assets\n(3,746,301 )\n-\nGain on sale of property and equipment\n-\n5,500\nLease impairment, California facility\n(200,512 )\n-\nGain on SBA PPP loan extinguishment\n-\n300,995\nOther (expense) income, net\n(10,919,488 )\n101,082\nNet loss before income tax\n(18,471,495 )\n(6,388,049 )\nIncome tax benefit\n3,049,293\n518,398\nNet loss from continuing operations\n(15,422,202 )\n(5,869,651 )\n(Loss) income from discontinued operations -

Accordingly, the results of the business were classified as discontinued operations in our statements of operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nThe significant accounting policies followed are:\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates underlying the Companys reported financial position and results of operations include the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, inventory valuation, fair value of stock-based compensation and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances.\nAccounts Receivable - The Company regularly reviews accounts receivable for any bad debts based on an analysis of the Companys collection experience, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on managements review of accounts receivable, the Company recorded $65,500 and $57,000 as allowance for doubtful accounts at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had no bad debt expenses and $131,968 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were direct write-offs against the specific accounts receivable.\nInventory - Inventory consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost is determined by the weighted average moving cost inventory method. Net realizable value is determined, with appropriate consideration given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, and other factors. On June 30, 2023 the Company had $11,557,128 of finished goods inventory and at June 30, 2022 had $4,725,685 of finished goods inventory with an inventory reserve of $475,000 and $50,000, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives of 5 years or the related lease term. Gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in the Statements of Operations in the period of disposition. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. The Company disposed of some equipment during 2023 and 2022 which resulted in gains on the sales as shown in the accompanying Statements of Operations.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Company to the sellers cash consideration and equity instruments issued. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\nGoodwill - The Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment at least annually and when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company performed its annual test as of June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. There was no impairment charge identified in connection with the annual goodwill impairment test at June 30, 2022. It was determined by management that the goodwill related to Interactive Offers was completely impaired at June 30, 2023 based on the sale of the business at September 1, 2023. An impairment of goodwill in the amount of $2,889,158 was recorded at June 30, 2023 eliminating all of the goodwill related to Interactive Offers.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. When impairment indicators exist, the Company estimates the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life in measuring whether or not the asset values are recoverable.\nThe Company did not recognize impairment on its long-lived assets during the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company did recognize an impairment of $857,143 on the assets held for sale, related to the Interactive Offers long-lived assets during the years ended June 30, 2023, leaving $716,944 of intangible assets related to Interactive Offers and classified as assets available for sale.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company analyzes its contracts and purchase orders to assess whether revenue is properly recognized. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, whether for goods and services or licensing, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company acts as principal in its revenue transactions as the Company is the primary obligor in the transactions. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for its products when ownership is transferred to the customer, provided no significant obligations remain and collection is probable.\nProduct Revenue - Most of the Companys revenue contracts are from domestic sales and represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of its products. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on the Companys selling list price, which is then reduced by estimated costs for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts used to incentivize sales growth and build brand awareness.\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product is transferred to the customer, which is upon shipment to the customer or other customer-designated delivery point. Taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental agencies are accounted for on a net basis and not included as revenue.\nThe Company does not accept sales returns from wholesale customers, as the products are pre-approved prior to production and shipment. E-Commerce product returns must be completed within 45 days of the date of purchase. The Company does not accrue estimated sales returns as historical sales returns have been minimal. The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable. Substantially all the deferred revenue as of June 30, 2022, was recognized as revenue in the year ended June 30, 2023.\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in revenue, as this revenue is not directly related to the distribution costs associated with an order. Shipping fees associated with freight are generally included in distribution costs.\nAdvertising - The Company supports its products with advertising to build brand awareness of the Companys various products in addition to other marketing programs executed by the Companys marketing team. The Company believes continual investment in advertising is critical to the development and sale of its branded products. Advertising costs of $7,978,607 and $3,225,256 were expensed as incurred during the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStock Based Compensation - The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) or immediately if the share-based payments vest immediately.\nNon-employee Stock-based Payments - The Companys accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of ASC 2018-07, which simplifies the accounting for non-employee share-based payment transactions. The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantors own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. Stock-based payments related to non-employees is accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services, whichever is more readily determinable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendors performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.\nFair Value Measurements - The Company accounts for financial instruments in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 Fair value Measurement and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\n\u00b7\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n\u00b7\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nThe estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue and debt are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nLeases - The Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception. GAAP requires that the Companys leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance leases for financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option will result in an economic penalty. All of the Companys real estate leases are classified as operating leases.\nMost real estate leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend the lease term for an additional two years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Companys discretion. The Company evaluates renewal options at lease inception and on an ongoing basis and includes renewal options that it is reasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities. Lease agreements generally do not require material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe Companys leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment.\nIncome Taxes - Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences. Such temporary differences result from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company identifies and evaluates uncertain tax positions, if any, and recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions for which there is a less than more-likely-than-not probability of the position being upheld when reviewed by the relevant taxing authority. Such positions are deemed to be unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding liability is established on the balance sheet. The Company has not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. There are no material uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2023.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate and the net operating loss incurred after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely and the two year net operating loss carried back was eliminated (prohibited).\nEarnings (loss) per Share - Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and upon the conversion of notes. For the year ended, the dilutive common shares are as follows:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nStock options\n4,839,278\n4,279,888\nWarrants\n220,297\n106,850\nPreferred stock\n277,778\n277,778\nConvertible debt\n1,157,651\n-\nTotal potential dilutive weighted average shares outstanding\n6,495,004\n4,664,516\nThe dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. During the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company reported a net loss, so the potential effect is not reflected in the financial statements.\nDeferred Revenue - The Company records deposits as deferred revenue when a customer pays in advance of shipping the product. Once the product is shipped, the deposit is recorded as revenue and the related commissions are paid. All products were shipped related to deposits in deferred revenue, in less than one year.\nConvertible Debt and Securities - The Company follows beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20, which applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion options in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as interest over the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the expense must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65, Non-controlling Interests in consolidated Financial Statements. This ASC clarifies that a non-controlling (minority) interest in subsidiaries is an ownership interest in the entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts attributed to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. In accordance with ASC 810-10-45-21, those losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries may exceed their interests in the subsidiarys equity. The excess and any further losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest shall be attributed to those interests even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (FASB), or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations upon adoption. The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the new provisions of ASC 326 (Financial Instruments - Credit Losses) pertaining to current expected credit losses, and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements.\nNote 3. Acquisitions\nVitaMedica Corporation\nThe Company purchased VitaMedica on August 1, 2021. VitaMedica Corporation is a leading online seller of supplements for surgery, recovery, skin, beauty, health, and wellness.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred to acquire VitaMedica and the amount of identified assets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\nFair value of consideration transferred:\nCash\n$ 2,000,000\nCash, working capital adjustment\n74,589\nCommon stock, 100,000 shares valued at $4.82 per common share, the closing price on August 4, 2021.\n482,000\nNote payable\n500,000\n$ 3,556,589\nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed:\nAccounts receivable\n$ 107,446\nInventory\n619,837\nPrepaid expenses\n117,268\nProperty and equipment\n13,220\nTrade name\n463,000\nCustomer list\n1,329,000\nNon-compete\n143,000\nRight of use asset\n112,612\nAccounts payable\n(140,068 )\nOperating lease\n(56,894 )\nOperating lease\n(112,612 )\nTotal identifiable net assets\n$ 2,595,809\nGoodwill\n$ 960,780\nThe business was acquired through an asset purchase agreement, that acquired all the tangible and intangible assets of the VitaMedica business.

Risks and Uncertainties\nThere is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in different markets.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced. The spread of COVID-19 around the world in the first quarter of 2020 has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. and international economies and, as such, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNote 15.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Companys financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were effective as of June 30, 2023.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Companys financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023. The ineffectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff:\n(i)\ninadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and\n(ii)\nlack of multiple levels of supervision and review.\nWe are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the current fiscal year, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.\nOur management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nManagements Remediation Plan\nThe weaknesses and their related risks are not uncommon in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of staff. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.\nHowever, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the current fiscal year as resources allow:\n(i)\nAppoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies and to implement additional levels in the review process and the implementation of the new ERP for all subsidiaries; and\n(ii)\nWe will attempt to implement the remediation efforts set out herein by the end of the 2024 fiscal year. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.\nManagement believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2023, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has added significant qualified resources to ensure proper segregation of duties and proper review of the financial reporting policies and procedures. Item 9B.

Our Board believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. We do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board. The Board, with the help of its nomination and corporate governance committee, will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.\nStockholder Communications\nWe do not have a formal policy regarding stockholder communications with our Board. A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chief Executive Officer, at the address appearing on the first page of this filing.

In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.

The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee or such other committee as is appointed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the 2019 Plan (the Committee). The Committee has full authority to administer and interpret the provisions of the 2019 Plan including, but not limited to, the authority to make all determinations with regard to the terms and conditions of an award made under the 2019 Plan.

Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nThe aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nAudit Fees\n$ 188,000\n$ 160,000\nAudit Related Fees and Acquisition Audit Fees\n189,420\n137,800\nTax Fees\n136,600\n122,500\nAll Other Fees\nTotal\n$ 514,020\n$ 420,300\nOur Board of Directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.\nOur Board of Directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors independence.\nPART IV Item 15.
