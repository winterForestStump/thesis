    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nOur Company\nWe are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 25, 2021 for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more market-leading, high-growth branded consumer and retail companies across a range of attractive and growing industry verticals. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn November 15, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 23,000,000 public units. Each unit consists of one Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A common stock for $11.50 per share.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 11,700,000 private placement warrants which were sold to our sponsor and at a purchase price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $11,700,000.\nUpon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $234,600,000 ($10.20 per Unit) of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were deposited into a trust account (the Trust Account) in the United States at First Republic Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.\nIt is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Aarti Kapoor, our Chief Executive Officer and Director, and Angad Hira, our Chief Financial Officer, who have many years of experience in covering and advising high-growth consumer and retail companies and brands in both M&A and capital markets transactions. We must complete our initial business combination by May 15, 2023, 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by May 15, 2023, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.\nOur Market Opportunity\nWhile we may acquire a business in any industry and in any geography, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management teams background and capitalize on their ability to identify and acquire a business focused on the consumer and retail industries in the United States and Canada.\nWe believe that select themes - including health & wellness, omnichannel distribution, sustainability & social impact and the success of challenger brands - are quickly shaping consumer behavior and driving rapid innovation within the consumer and retail industry. We believe that the next generation of brands in the consumer and retail landscape must be prepared to meet the needs of consumers who are increasingly wellness-conscious, values-driven, demand the convenience of shopping both online and in physical stores, and are seeking innovation across all facets of their lifestyle. With VMGs years of experience positioning portfolio companies to thrive in a dynamic consumer and retail environment, we believe that we are poised to continue supporting the next generation of brands as the consumer landscape continues to evolve.\nOur Management Team\nOur management team is led by Aarti Kapoor, our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Mauz\u00e9, our Chairman of the Board, and Angad Hira, our Chief Financial Officer. They are complemented by our independent directors, Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth.\nPast performance of our management team and advisors is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical performance record of our management team or advisors as\nindicative of our future performance. Additionally, in the course of their respective careers, members of our management team have been involved in businesses and deals that were unsuccessful. Some of our officers, directors and advisors have not had experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies in the past. In addition, our executive officers, directors and advisors may have conflicts of interest with other entities to which they owe fiduciary or contractual obligations with respect to initial business combination opportunities.\nOur Mission\nVMG Consumer Acquisition Corp. is a platform created to acquire and generate value for consumer and retail companies across a range of attractive and growing industry verticals. We are an affiliate of VMG Partners, an investment firm founded in 2005 to invest in emerging consumer businesses and support founders and management teams in strengthening their brands, enhancing their quality of operations and accelerating the growth trajectory of their businesses. We believe our affiliation with VMG Partners, combined with our managements extensive experience across multiple verticals and business models, will enable us to identify the emerging trends and consumer behavioral shifts that are shaping the future of the consumer and retail industry.\nOur areas of focus span an array of business models, including consumer packaged goods, brick-and-mortar, digital and tech-enabled brands, with key industry verticals including but not limited to:\nFood & Beverage\nBeauty & Personal Care\nHealth & Wellness\nPet Products & Services\nHousehold Products\nApparel, Footwear & Accessories\nMulti-Unit Retailers / Services\nWith the combined expertise of our management and VMG investment professionals, we believe that VMG Consumer Acquisition Corp. benefits from a differentiated ability to access high-quality, fast-growing consumer and retail companies and which can generate meaningful value for stockholders under the Companys ownership.\nFor further details regarding our business, see the sections titled Our Company and Our Market Opportunity contained in our prospectus dated November 12, 2021, incorporated by reference herein (the prospectus).\nVMG\nFounded in 2005, VMG Partners invests in high-growth, emerging consumer and retail businesses and supports founders and management teams on their mission to create differentiated consumer brands and experiences.\nFor further details regarding our sponsor, see the section titled VMG contained in our prospectus dated November 12, 2021, incorporated by reference herein.\nOur Acquisition and Value Creation Strategy\nWe intend to source and pursue potential targets that we believe will benefit from the collective investment, advisory and operating expertise of our management team, directors, advisory board members, VMG Partners and the broader VMG relationship network.\nWe believe we can drive value creation by leveraging various aspects of the existing VMG Partners playbook, and building upon these skills with the incremental experience of our management team, directors and advisory board members to provide additional areas of support relevant to consumer and retail targets in the public market.\nWe intend to acquire a company with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the placement units and the sponsor loan. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing.\nFor further details regarding our acquisition and value creation strategy, see the section titled \u2018Our Acquisition and Value Creation Strategy contained in our prospectus dated November 12, 2021, incorporated by reference herein.\nInitial Business Combination\nAs required by Nasdaq rules, our initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Nasdaq rules also require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Although we may purchase multiple businesses in related industries in connection with our initial business combination, we do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.\nOur Business Combination Process\nIn evaluating prospective business combinations, we conduct a thorough due diligence review process that encompasses, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), in-depth assessment of the management talent, on-site inspection of\nfacilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, assessment of the organization readiness for public company status, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We also seek to utilize the expertise of our management team in analyzing technology companies and evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nCertain of our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he may need to honor his fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will provide that we renounce, to the maximum extent permitted by law, our interest or expectancy in, or being offered an opportunity to participate in any business combination opportunity: (i) which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and our sponsor or its affiliates and any companies in which our sponsor or its affiliates have invested about which any of the officers or directors acquire knowledge\u037e or (ii) the presentation of which would breach an existing legal obligation of a director or officer to another entity, and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will contain provisions to exculpate and indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such persons in respect of any liability, obligation or duty to our company that may arise as a consequence of such persons becoming aware of any business opportunity or failing to present such business opportunity. In addition, our officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to the completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved.\nOur Management Team\nWe currently have two officers: Aarti Kapoor and Angad Hira. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\nWe believe our management teams operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships in the consumer and retail industry. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management teams relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.\nStatus as a Public Company\nWe believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this\nmethod a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.\nFurthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.\nWhile we believe that our structure and our management teams backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 15, 2026, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A Common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our Common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.\nFinancial Position\nWith funds available for an initial business combination in the amount of $234,935,876 (assuming no redemptions), which amount includes $8,050,000 of the underwriters deferred discount, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of\nits operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.\nEffecting Our Initial Business Combination\nWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A Common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\nSince our inception, we have examined a number of potential business combinations, including discussions between our officers and the target businesses themselves, and in some instances, with our underwriters and advisers. Some of the members of our management team are employed by certain affiliates of VMG. VMG is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination. We have not and will not consider a business combination with any company that has already been identified to VMG as a suitable acquisition candidate for it. We continue to examine potential business combinations with new and existing target businesses. Although our management assesses the risks inherent in all particular target businesses with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter, including risks outside of our control.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.\nSources of Target Businesses\nOur management team has built a broad network of relationships in the consumer and retail industry, and we believe this network will be significantly bolstered by the collective relationships of our directors, advisory board members and VMG Partners. Over the course of their careers, the members of each of these groups have built relationships with relevant industry constituencies including founders, management teams, stockholders, industry experts and advisors across multiple consumer and retail verticals, both in the U.S. and globally. Our management teams relationship network is a product of both investment banking and principal investing activities such as consumer and retail industry coverage, mergers & acquisitions and IPO transaction advisory, investment target sourcing and the acquisition, financing and sale of businesses under varying economic and financial market conditions.\nIn addition to relationships from principal business activities, the members of our management team, our directors and our advisory board members have developed contacts from serving on the boards of directors of several companies in the consumer and retail industry and beyond. Similarly, VMG investment professionals benefit from VMGs track record of evaluating potential investment candidates as well as working with current and former VMG portfolio management teams and board members.\nWe believe this combined reach across our management team, directors, advisory board members and VMG Partners will provide management with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of investors are invited to participate in the sale process. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banks, growth equity funds, private equity funds and strategic corporations seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. We also expect that we may receive direct inbound requests from unaffiliated targets given VMGs history and touchpoints in the consumer and retail industry.\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, directors or officers. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.\nAs more fully discussed in Conflicts of Interest, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our directors and officers currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.\nEvaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination\nAs required by Nasdaq rules, our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Nasdaq rules also require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.\nIn any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaqs 80% fair market value test. There is no basis for our investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.\nTo the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\nIn evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, in-depth assessment of the management talent, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, assessment of the organization readiness for public company status, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.\nThe time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.\nLack of Business Diversification\nFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:\nsubject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and\ncause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.\nLimited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team\nAlthough we continue to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\nFollowing an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\nStockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination\nWe may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.\nType of Transaction\nWhether\nStockholder\nApproval is\nRequired\nPurchase of assets\nNo\nPurchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company\nNo\nMerger of target into a subsidiary of the company\nNo\nMerger of the company with a target\nYes\nUnder Nasdaqs listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:\nwe issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);\nany of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) have a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or\nthe issuance or potential issuance of Common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.\nThe decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and other reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\nthe timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;\nthe expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;\nthe risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;\nother time and budget constraints of the company; and\nadditional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.\nPermitted Purchases of our Securities\nIn the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.\nThere is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates determine to undertake any such transactions, such transactions could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. They will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. Subsequent to the consummation of our initial public offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) clear certain trades prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.\nIn the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.\nThe purpose of such transaction could be to (1) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of our initial business combination, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our securities and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nOur sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of public shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and their respective affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.\nAny purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of Common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.\nRedemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination\nWe will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering.\nLimitation on Redemptions\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise fund through the sale of equity, debt or a combination thereof in connection with our initial business combination in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\nWe will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock or seek to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaqs stockholder approval rules. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.\nIf a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation:\nconduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and\nfile tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.\nUpon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.\nIn the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).\nIf, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation:\nconduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and\nfile proxy materials with the SEC.\nWe expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least ten days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.\nIn the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares, alignment shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our\ninitial stockholders will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, alignment shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all public shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to the Excess Shares without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.\nHowever, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.\nTendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights\nWe may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least ten days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would\nbe made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\nThe foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.\nAny request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.\nIf our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.\nIf our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period.\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination\nOur sponsor, directors and officers have agreed that we will initially have only 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time frame to complete our initial business combination.\nOur sponsor, directors and officers will agree, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,600,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.\nIf we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.20. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.20. Please see Risk Factors - If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.20 per share and other risk factors described in our Registration Statement. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims.\nAlthough we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver only if management believes that such third-partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.\nOur sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.20 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third-party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (1) $10.20 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.20 per share. Please see Risk Factors -If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.20 per share and other risk factors described in our Registration Statement.\nWe will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,600,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. Because our offering expenses in connection with our initial public offering (including underwriting commissions) were less than our estimate of $900,000, the amount of funds we intend to hold outside the trust account has increased by approximately $450,425 to approximately $2,050,425.\nUnder the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.\nFurthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we have not completed our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our acquisition period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.\nBecause we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.\nAs a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below: (1) $10.20 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third-party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.\nIf we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Please see, in our Registration Statement, Risk Factors - If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nOur public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants.\nComparison of Redemption or Purchase Prices in Connection with Our Initial Business Combination and if We Fail to Complete Our Initial Business Combination.\nThe following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and if we have not completed our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period.\nRedemptions in Connection with\nour Initial Business Combination\nOther Permitted Purchases of\nPublic Shares by our Affiliates\nRedemptions if we Fail to\nComplete an Initial Business\nCombination\nCalculation of redemption price\nRedemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. In either case, our public stockholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination (which is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per share), including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take place if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit to the prices that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may pay in these transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going- private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.\nIf we have not completed our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount, then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per share), including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest income to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.\nRedemptions in Connection with\nour Initial Business Combination\nOther Permitted Purchases of\nPublic Shares by our Affiliates\nRedemptions if we Fail to\nComplete an Initial Business\nCombination\nImpact to remaining stockholder\nThe redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining stockholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and interest withdrawn in order to pay our taxes and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (to the extent not paid from amounts accrued as interest on the funds held in the trust account).\nIf the permitted purchases described above are made, there would be no impact to our remaining stockholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us.\nThe redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our initial stockholders, who will be our only remaining stockholders after such redemptions.\nCompetition\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.\nConflicts of Interest\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:\nthe corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;\nthe opportunity is within the corporations line of business; and\nit would not be fair to our company and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nBelow is a table summarizing the VMG-related and other entities to which our officers and directors currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations:\nIndividual\nEntity/Organization\nEntitys Business\nAffiliation\nAarti Kapoor*\nAngad Hira\nVMG Partners\nInvestments\nChief Financial Officer, Partner\nMichael Mauz\u00e9\nVMG Partners\nSpindrift\nIlegal Mezcal\nLittle Freddie\nST Distributing\nInvestments\nConsumer Products\nConsumer Products\nConsumer Products\nConsumer Products\nPartner\nDirector\nDirector\nDirector\nDirector\nJasmin Allen\nMoet Hennessey USA\nConsumer Products\nSenior Vice President and General Manager\nLowell Singer\nAcrisure\nInsurance and Financial Services\nChief Financial Officer\nJohn Toth\nPhoenix Industries\nHousehold Fixtures\nBoard Member\n*Beginning on January 1, 2023, Ms. Kapoor will become an employee of VMG Partners II, LLC, an affiliate of the Company and its sponsor.\nInvestors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:\nOur officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs.\nOur initial stockholders purchased founder shares prior to the date of this Report and will purchase private placement warrants in a transaction that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. Our sponsor, officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, our sponsor, officers and directors will agree to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or during any Extension Period. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Furthermore, our sponsor, officers and directors will agree not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the date following the completion of our initial business combination on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, the founder shares will be released from the lockup. The private placement warrants (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable until 30 days following the completion of our initial business combination. Because each of our officers and directors will own common stock or warrants directly or indirectly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Furthermore, in no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid by the company any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination.\nIn addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. Our board of directors will review any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.\nWe cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nIn the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares, and they and the other members of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and any shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination.\nLimitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will provide that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors.\nWe have entered into agreements with our officers, directors and advisory board members to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, advisory board members or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification.\nWe expect to purchase a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers, directors and advisory board members against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers, directors and advisory board members.\nOur officers, directors and advisory board members have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination.\nOur indemnification obligations may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nWe believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers, directors and advisory board members.\nFacilities\nWe currently utilize office space at 39 Mesa Street, Suite 310, San Francisco, CA 94129 from our sponsor and the members of our management team as our executive offices. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\nEmployees\nWe currently have two officers: Aarti Kapoor and Angad Hira. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\nPeriodic Reporting and Financial Information\nWe have registered our units, shares of Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.\nWe will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.\nWe will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.\nPrior to the date of our Report, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations:\nwe are a newly incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective;\nour public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination;\nif we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders, directors and officers have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote;\nyour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of such business combination;\nthe ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target;\nthe requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders;\nour search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and other events and the status of debt and equity markets;\nwe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may receive only $10.20 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless;\nif we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may elect to purchase shares or warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our securities;\nbecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless;\nwe may have limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company;\nwe may be able to complete only one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability;\nwe are dependent upon our directors and officers and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate;\nour key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous;\nour directors directors and officers will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination;\nour directors, officers, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests;\nthe ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares;\nyou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares and/or warrants, potentially at a loss;\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions;\nyou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies;\nif we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of the shares of our Class A common stock, you will lose your ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of shares of our Class A common stock;\nwe may be subject to a 1% excise tax on any repurchase of our corporate stock beginning on January 1, 2023, pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022; and\nour independent registered public accounting firms report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, since we will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by May 15, 2023.\nFor the complete list of risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our Registration Statement. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties.\nWe currently utilize office space at 39 Mesa Street, Suite 310 San Francisco, CA 94129 from our sponsor as our executive offices. Commencing on the effective date of the initial public offering, we began payments to our sponsor or an affiliate thereof of up to $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of our management team. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nTo the knowledge of our management team, there is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n(a)Market Information\nOur public units, public shares and public warrants are each traded on Nasdaq under the symbols VMGAU, VMGA and VMGAW, respectively. Our public units commenced public trading on November 11, 2021, and our public shares and public warrants commenced separate public trading on January 3, 2022.\n(b)Holders\nOn September 30, 2022, there was 1 holder of record of our units, 1 holder of record of our Class A Common stock and 2 holders of record of our warrants.\n(c)Dividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\n(d)Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans.\nNone.\n(e)Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn July 1, 2021, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. Such securities were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size of our initial public offering would be a maximum of 23,000,000 units if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after our initial public offering. Up to 750,000 of these shares may be surrendered for no consideration depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment is exercised.\nOur sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation D. Each of the equity holders in our sponsor is an accredited investor under Rule 501 of Regulation D. The sole business of our sponsor is to act as the companys sponsor in connection with our initial public offering. The limited liability company agreement of our sponsor provides that its membership interests may only be transferred to our officers or directors or other persons affiliated with our sponsor, or in connection with estate planning transfers.\nOur sponsor entered into a written agreement dated November 10, 2021 to purchase from us an aggregate of 11,700,000 private placement warrants at $1.00 per warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $11,700,000. This purchase took place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering. This issuance will be made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nNo underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales.\n(f)Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\n(g)Use of Proceeds from the Initial Public Offering\nOn November 15, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 23,000,000 public units, including 3,000,000 public units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one public share and one-half of one public warrant, with each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one public share for $11.50 per share. The public units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $230,000,000, Moelis acted as bookrunner and representative of the underwriters of the initial public offering.\nOn November 15, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of an aggregate of 11,700,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of $11,700,000.\nA total of $234,600,000 of the proceeds from our initial public offering (which amount includes $8,050,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) and the sale of the placement units, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account, maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. The proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Item 6. Reserved. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a blank check company incorporated on March 25, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry, we intend to focus our search on companies in the consumer and retail sectors. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.\nThe issuance of additional shares in connection with a business combination to the owners of the target or other investors:\nmay significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions with respect to the Class B common stock resulted in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the shares of Class B common stock;\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of Class A common stock if preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A common stock;\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;\nmay have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or warrants. Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to bank or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result in:\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;\nour inability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock;\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nResults of Operations\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through September 30, 2022 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, the Companys search for a target business with which to complete a Business Combination and activities in connection with the proposed Transactions. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing a Business Combination.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we had a net loss of $634,686, which consists of general and administrative expenses of $1,070,562, franchise tax expense of $175,000, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $848,246 and income tax expense of $237,370.\nFor the period from March 25, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021 we had a net loss of 105,725, which consisted all of formation costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUntil the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Companys only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of shares of Class B common stock by the Sponsor and loans from our Sponsor.\nOn November 15, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 Units, inclusive of the underwriters election to exercise their option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $11,700,000.\nFollowing the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $234,600,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $17,699,575 in transaction costs, including $4,600,000 of underwriting fees and $5,049,575 of other costs and $8,050,000 in deferred underwriting fees.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $(1,583,882). This was made up of a Net loss of $(634,686) and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(100,950), and a $(848,246) gain on marketable securities. For the period from March 25, 2021 (Inception) through September 30, 2021 there was no cash flow from operating activities.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $235,448,246. We may withdraw interest to pay our income taxes, if any. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash of $535,276. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant unit at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.\nWe do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. The liquidation deadline for the Company is also within the next twelve months if an initial Business Combination is not consummated. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful.\nAs a result of the above, in connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the liquidity conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern through approximately one year from the date of filing. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nContractual obligations\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities.\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $8,050,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will be waived by the underwriters in the event that the Company does not complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.\nAdministrative Support Agreement\nThe Company agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month, commencing on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering, for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the management team. Upon completion of the initial Business Combination or the liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred and paid $106,333 in administrative support fees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:\nClass A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The Companys Class A common stock represented by Public Shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2022, all Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside the stockholders deficit section of the Companys balance sheets.\nNet loss per Share of Common Stock\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding during the period. The Company has not considered the effect of warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement to purchase common stock in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events.\nThe Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock (the Founder Shares). Earnings are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares on the assumption that the consummation of the initial Business Combination is the most likely outcome. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. As of September 30, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\nRecent accounting standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a standard (ASU No. 2020-06) to reduce the complexity of accounting for convertible debt and other equity-linked instruments. For certain convertible debt instruments with a cash conversion feature, the changes are a trade-off between simplifications in the accounting model (no separation of an equity component to impute a market interest rate, and simpler analysis of embedded equity features) and a potentially adverse impact to diluted EPS by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The new standard will also impact other financial instruments commonly issued by both public and private companies. For example, the separation model for beneficial conversion features is eliminated simplifying the analysis for issuers of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. Also, certain specific requirements to achieve equity classification and/ or qualify for the derivative scope exception for contracts indexed to an entitys own equity are removed, enabling more freestanding instruments and embedded features to avoid mark-to-market accounting. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard can either be adopted on a modified retrospective or a full retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 upon its incorporation. The impact to the Companys balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flows was not material.\nThe Companys management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statement. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nNot required for smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThis information appears following Item 15 of this Report and is included herein by reference. Item 9.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year of 2022 covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\nPART III Item 10.

Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to the rights of holders of Class B common stock to elect directors may be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our common stock voting in a general meeting.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.\nOur officers are elected by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to elect officers as it deems appropriate pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nDirector Independence\nThe rules of Nasdaq require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the companys board of directors, would interfere with the directors exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this Report forms a part, we expect to have three independent directors as defined in Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our board of directors has determined that Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth are independent directors as defined in Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Both our audit committee and our compensation committee will be composed solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee will operate under a charter that will be approved by our board and will have the composition and responsibilities described below. The charter of each committee is available on our website at www.vmgspac.com.\nAudit Committee\nWe have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth serve as members of our audit committee, and John Toth chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth meets the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.\nEach member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that John Toth qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules and has accounting or related financial management expertise.\nWe have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including:\nassisting board oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm; the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;\npre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; reviewing and discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm all relationships the registered public accounting firm have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;\nsetting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (1) the independent registered public accounting firms internal quality-control procedures and (2) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the registered public accounting firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;\nmeeting to review and discuss our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including reviewing our specific disclosures under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and\nreviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompensation Committee\nWe have established a compensation committee of the board of directors. Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth are independent, and Lowell Singer chairs the compensation committee.\nWe have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:\nreviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our chief executive officers compensation, evaluating our chief executive officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our chief executive officers based on such evaluation;\nreviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to the compensation, and any incentive compensation and equity based plans that are subject to board approval of all of our other officers;\nreviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;\nimplementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;\nassisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;\napproving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;\nif required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and\nreviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to an affiliate of our sponsor of up to $10,000 per month, for up to 18 months, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination.\nThe charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nWe have established a nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors. Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth serve as members of our nominating and corporate governance committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, all the directors on the nominating and corporate governance committee must be independent. Jasmin Allen, Lowell Singer and John Toth are independent, and Jasmin Allen chairs the nominating and corporate governance committee.\nWe have adopted a nominating and corporate governance committee charter, which will detail the purpose and responsibilities of the nominating and corporate governance committee, including:\nidentifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors, consistent with criteria approved by the board, and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual general meeting or to fill vacancies on the board of directors;\ndeveloping and recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines;\ncoordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance of the company; and\nreviewing on a regular basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary.\nThe charter also provides that the nominating and corporate governance committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of, and terminate, any search firm to be used to identify director candidates, and will be directly responsible for approving the search firms fees and other retention terms.\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. Prior to our initial business combination, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board of directors.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committee charters as exhibits to our Registration Statement and copies are available on our website at www.vmgspac.com. You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at www.vmgspac.com or at the SECs web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Item 11. Executive Compensation\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nSince November 11, 2021, we have paid and will continue to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.\nNone of our executive officers or directors have received any cash (or non-cash) compensation for services rendered to us. We may pay our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation in connection with identifying, investigating and completing our initial business combination, which may be paid from the proceeds held in the trust account upon consummation of an initial business combination. These individuals and entities are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, advisors or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination are made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination.\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our managements motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not\nbelieve that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.\nThe compensation committee has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based upon its review and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Report. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of September 30, 2022 based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of Common stock, by:\neach person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding Common stock;\neach of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our Common stock; and\nall our executive officers and directors as a group.\nIn the table below, percentage ownership is based on 28,750,000 our Common stock, consisting of (i) 23,000,000 our Class A Common stock and (ii) 5,750,000 our Class B Common stock, issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022. On all matters to be voted upon holders of the Class A Common stock and Class B Common stock vote together as a single class. Currently, all of the Class B Common stock are convertible into Class A Common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the placement units as these private units are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.\nClass A Ordinary Shares\nClass B Ordinary Shares\nName and Address of Beneficial Owner(1)\nNumber of\nShares\nBeneficially\nOwned\nApproximate\nPercentage of\nClass\nNumber of\nShares\nBeneficially\nOwned(2)\nApproximate\nPercentage\nof Class\nApproximate\nPercentage\nof\nOutstanding\nOrdinary\nShares\nVMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings,\nLLC(3)\n-\n-\n5,585,000\n97.1%\n19.4%\nAarti Kapoor\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAngad S.

Such shares will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment, as described in the section entitled Description of Securities.\n(3)\nVMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC, our sponsor, is the record holder of the securities reported herein. VMG Partners IV GP, L.P. is the general partner of VMG Partners IV, L.P. and its parallel vehicle, VMG Partners Mentors Circle IV, L.P., which jointly control VMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC as its sole members with consent rights. Voting and investment determinations with respect to the securities held of record by VMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC have been delegated by VMG Partners IV GP, L.P. to VMG Partners II, LLC. VMG Partners II, LLC is controlled by its members, consisting of Michael Mauz\u00e9, Wayne Wu, Robin Tsai and Carle Stenmark. Accordingly, each of the entities and individuals named herein may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the securities held of record by VMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC. Each of them disclaims any such beneficial ownership.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Table\nNone.\nChanges in Control\nNone. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\nOn July 1, 2021, our sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, for an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares. Up to 750,000 of the founder shares may be surrendered by our sponsor for no consideration depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment is exercised. In September and October 2021, our sponsor transferred 35,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors and 15,000 founder shares to each of our advisory board members, in each case at a purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share.\nOur sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,700,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $11,700,000, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold in our initial public offering except that the private placement warrants, (i) will not be redeemable by us, (ii) may not (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights. The private placement warrants (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.\nWe currently utilize office space at 39 Mesa Street, Suite 310 San Francisco, CA 94129 from our sponsor as our executive offices. Commencing on the effective date of our initial public offering, we began payments to our sponsor or an affiliate thereof of up to $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of our management team. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.\nNo compensation of any kind, including finders and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.\nIn addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.\nAny of the foregoing payments to our sponsor, repayments of loans from our sponsor or repayments of working capital loans prior to our initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account.\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.\nOn November 10, 2021, we entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder shares and private placement warrants.\nPolicy for Approval of Related Party Transactions\nThe audit committee of our board of directors has adopted a policy setting forth the policies and procedures for its review and approval or ratification of related party transactions. A related party transaction is any consummated or proposed transaction or series of transactions: (i) in which the company was or is to be a participant; (ii) the amount of which exceeds (or is reasonably expected to exceed) the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of the companys total assets at year end for the prior two completed fiscal years in the aggregate over the duration of the transaction (without regard to profit or loss); and (iii) in which a related party had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related parties under this policy will include: (i) our directors, nominees for director or officers; (ii) any record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing if the foregoing person is a natural person; and (iv) any other person who maybe a related person pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the policy, the audit committee will consider (i) the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms-length dealings with an unrelated third party, (ii) the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction, (iii) whether the transaction contravenes our code of ethics or other policies, (iv) whether the audit committee believes the relationship underlying the transaction to be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders and (v) the effect that the transaction may have on a directors status as an independent member of the board and on his or her eligibility to serve on the boards committees. Management will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party. Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.\nThe firm of Marcum LLP, or Marcum, acts as our independent registered public accounting firm. The following is a summary of fees paid to Marcum for services rendered.\nAudit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Marcum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of Marcum related to audit and review services in connection with our regulatory filings totaled approximately $77,250 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAudit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we did not pay Marcum any audit-related fees.\nTax Fees. Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. We did not pay Marcum for tax return services, planning and tax advice for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAll Other Fees. All other fees consist of fees billed for all other services. We did not pay Marcum for any other services for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nPre-Approval Policy\nOur audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).\nPART IV Item 15.

Form 10-K Summary\nNot applicable.\nVMG CONSUMER ACQUISITION CORP.\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID # 688)\nFinancial statements:\nBalance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nStatements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (Inception) through September 30, 2021\nStatements of Changes in Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption and Stockholders Deficit for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (Inception) through September 30, 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (Inception) through September 30, 2021\nNotes to Financial Statements\n-\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of\nVMG Consumer Acquisition Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of VMG Consumer Acquisition Corp. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in common stock subject to possible redemption and stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows and changes in stockholders deficit for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph - Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Companys business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Companys cash and working capital as of September 30, 2022 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum llp\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021\nNew York, NY\nDecember 22, 2022\nVMG CONSUMER

ACQUISITION CORP.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Description of Organization and Business Operations, Going Concern Considerations\nVMG Consumer Acquisition Corp. (the Company) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 25, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination). The Company is an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity since March 25, 2021 relates to the Companys formation and the preparation of its initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering) described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected September 30 as its fiscal year end.\nThe Companys sponsor is VMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor). The registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 10, 2021. On November 15, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units offered, the Public Shares), including 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the Over-Allotment Units), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000, and incurring offering costs of $5,049,575 and $8,050,000 in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 5).\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of 11,700,000 warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of $11,700,000 (Note 4).\nUpon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $234,600,000 ($10.20 per Unit) of the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were deposited into a trust account (the Trust Account) in the United States at First Republic Bank. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, to be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any money market funds meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), which invest only in direct U.S, government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Companys stockholders, as described below.\nThe Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. Nasdaq rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a\ntender offer. In connection with an initial Business Combination, the Company may seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which Public Stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\nIf the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Companys prior written consent.\nThe Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the representative of the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Companys warrants. These shares of Class A common stock were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\nIf a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.\nThe Companys Sponsor agreed (a) to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination; (b) not to propose an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the Companys pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) and Private Placement Warrants (including underlying securities) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek stockholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights of pre-Business Combination activity; and (d) that the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants (including underlying securities) shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or May 15, 2023 (the Combination Period), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal\ndissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirement of applicable law. The representative of the underwriters agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nThe Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Companys indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. None of the Companys officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (the COVID-19 outbreak). In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve. Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Companys financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. These financial statements did not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions due to the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The conflict is expected to have further global economic consequences, including but not limited to the possibility of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about economic and political stability. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia which increases the risk that Russia, as a retaliatory action, may launch cyberattacks against the United States, its government, infrastructure and businesses. Any of the foregoing consequences, including those we cannot yet predict, may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stocks to be adversely affected.\nGoing Concern Consideration and Liquidity\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had $535,276 in its operating bank account, $235,448,246 in securities held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its common stock in connection therewith and working capital of $435,125. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. If the Companys estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence, and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to an initial Business Combination. The liquidation deadline for the Company is also within the next twelve months if an initial Business Combination is not consummated. The Company cannot assure that its plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful.\nAs a result of the above, in connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the liquidity conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern through approximately one year from the date of filing. These financial statements did not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $535,276 and $65,000 in cash and no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nMarketable Securities Held in Trust Account\nAs of September 30, 2022, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in investments in U.S. treasury securities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage limit of $250,000. At September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluated its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. There were no derivative financial instruments that are liability-classified as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Companys control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. ASC 480-10-S99 addresses concerns raised by the SEC regarding the financial statement classification and measurement of securities subject to mandatory redemption requirements or whose redemption is outside the control of the issuer. If the stock subject to mandatory redemptions provisions\nrepresents the only shares in the reporting entity, it must report instruments in the liabilities section of its statement of financial position. The stock subject must then describe them as shares subject to mandatory redemption, so as to distinguish the instruments from other financial statement liabilities. The Company concludes that the Companys warrants defined in Note 6 do not exhibit any of the above characteristics and, therefore are outside the scope of ASC 480.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. The 11,500,000 Public Warrants and 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants, including over-allotment, were issued in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because these warrants meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, they will be recorded as component of stockholders equity. The Company accounts for its outstanding warrants as equity-classified instruments.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.\nThe hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our marketable securities, due to their nature, are assessed as a level 1 instrument with a fair value of $235,448,246.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and Stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the\nExchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOffering Costs\nOffering costs consist of legal, accounting, underwriting and other costs incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in November 2021, the offering costs were allocated using the relative fair values of the Companys common stock and its Warrants. The costs allocated to Warrants were charged against additional paid-in capital and those related to the Company's common stock were charged to the carrying value of Class A common stock.\nNet loss Per Share of Common Stock\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding during the period. The Company has not considered the effect of the 11,500,000 Public Warrants and 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering (the Public Warrants) and Private Placement to purchase common stock in the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted income per share is the same as basic income per share for the periods presented.\nThe Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock (the Founder Shares). Earnings are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares on the assumption that the consummation of the initial Business Combination is the most likely outcome. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nA reconciliation of the earnings per share is below:\nFor The Year\nEnded September\n30, 2022\nFor The Period\nFrom March 25,\n2021 (Inception)\nThrough\nSeptember 30,\nRedeemable Class A Common Stock\nNumerator: Net loss allocable to Redeemable Class\nA Common Stock\n$\n(495,627\n)\n$\n-\nDenominator: Weighted Average Share Outstanding,\nRedeemable Class A Common Stock\nBasic and diluted weighted average shares\noutstanding, Redeemable Class A Common Stock\n20,164,384\n-\nBasic and Diluted Net Earnings per Share,\nRedeemable Class A Common Stock\n$\n(0.02\n)\n$\n0.00\nNon-Redeemable Class B Common Stock\nNumerator: Net loss allocable to non-redeemable\nClass B Common Stock\n$\n(139,059\n)\n$\n(105,725\n)\nDenominator: Weighted Average Shares\nOutstanding, Non-Redeemable Class B Common\nStock\nBasic and diluted weighted average shares\noutstanding, Non-Redeemable Class B Common\nstock\n5,657,534\n5,000,000\nBasic and Diluted Net Earnings per Share,\nNon-Redeemable Class B Common Stock\n$\n(0.02\n)\n$\n(0.02\n)\nClass A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The Companys Class A common stock represented by Public Shares features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events.\nAll of the Class A common stock sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Companys liquidation if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. In accordance with SEC and its staffs guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require Class A common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2022, all Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of the Companys balance sheets.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Class A common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable Class A common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.\nAt September 30, 2022, 23,000,000 common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value ($10.21) as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of the Companys balance sheets.\nGross proceeds\n$\n230,000,000\nLess:\nClass A common stock issuance costs\n(12,671,158\n)\nFair value of Public Warrants at issuance\n(7,151,850\n)\nPlus:\nRemeasurement of carrying value to redemption value\n24,758,884\nClass A common stock subject to possible\nredemption at September 30, 2022\n$\n234,935,876\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Companys management determined that the United States is the Companys only major tax jurisdiction. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The Companys management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not\nby the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and inhibit the Companys ability to complete a Business Combination.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued a standard (ASU No. 2020-06) to reduce the complexity of accounting for convertible debt and other equity-linked instruments. For certain convertible debt instruments with a cash conversion feature, the changes are a trade-off between simplifications in the accounting model (no separation of an equity component to impute a market interest rate, and simpler analysis of embedded equity features) and a potentially adverse impact to diluted EPS by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The new standard will also impact other financial instruments commonly issued by both public and private companies. For example, the separation model for beneficial conversion features is eliminated simplifying the analysis for issuers of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. Also, certain specific requirements to achieve equity classification and/ or qualify for the derivative scope exception for contracts indexed to an entitys own equity are removed, enabling more freestanding instruments and embedded features to avoid mark-to-market accounting. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard can either be adopted on a modified retrospective or a full retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 upon its incorporation. The impact to the Companys balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flows was not material.\nThe Companys management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.\nNote 3 - Initial Public Offering\nOn November 15, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units offered, the Public Shares), including 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the Over-Allotment Units), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000, and incurring offering costs of $5,049,575 and $8,050,000 in deferred underwriting commissions.\nEach Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A Common Stock), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (Warrant), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share.\nNote 4 - Related Party Transactions\nClass B Founder Shares\nIn July 2021, the Sponsor acquired 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock (the Class B Founder Shares) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, we had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share purchase price of the Class B Founder Shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the aggregate number of Class B Founder Shares issued.\nIn August, September and October 2021, the Sponsor transferred 35,000 Class B Founder Shares to each of our independent directors, Jasmin Allen, John Toth and Lowell J. Singer, and 15,000 Class B Founder Shares to each of our four advisory board members, in each case at a purchase price of approximately $0.004 per share.\nThe Class B Founder Shares will automatically convert into shares of the Companys Class A common stock on the first business day following the completion of the initial Business Combination at a ratio such that the number of shares of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Class B Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of shares of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding upon completion of this offering, plus (ii) the sum of (a) the total number of shares of the Companys common stock issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or deemed issued by the company in connection with or in relation to the completion of the initial\nBusiness Combination, excluding (1) any shares of the Companys Class A common stock or equity-linked securities exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into shares of the Companys Class A common stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and (2) any private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of working capital loans, minus (b) the number of Public Shares redeemed by Public Stockholders in connection with the initial Business Combination.\nRelated Party Promissory Note\nOn July 1, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $300,000 to be used for the payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the Note). The Note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon the earlier of December 31, 2021, or the date the Company consummates the Initial Public Offering. The Company intends to repay the Note from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering not being placed in the Trust Account. On July 19, 2021, the Company borrowed $100,000 under the Note with the Sponsor and had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022 and a balance of $100,000 as of September 30, 2021.\nPrivate Placement Warrants\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of $11,700,000.\nEach warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of the Companys Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Certain proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirement of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nAdministrative Support Agreement\nCommencing on the date of the Initial Public Offering, the Company has paid the Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to the members of the Companys management team. Upon completion of the initial Business Combination or the Companys liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.\nNote 5 - Commitments & Contingencies\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement will provide that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments at the Initial Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters fully exercised the option on November 11, 2021.\nThe underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 2.0% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or $4,600,000 in the aggregate, which was paid upon closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the representative of the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public\nOffering, or $8,050,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the representative of the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.\nWorking Capital Loans\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. To date, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.\nNote 6 - Stockholders Deficit\nPreferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys board of directors. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.\nClass A Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there were no shares of Class A common stock issued or outstanding (excluding 23,000,000 shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption which are presented as temporary equity).\nClass B Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 there were 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nHolders of the Class A common stock and holders of the Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders, except as required by law or stock exchange rule; provided that only holders of the Class B common stock shall have the right to vote on the election of the Company's directors prior to the initial Business Combination. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial Business Combination, holders of a majority of the outstanding Founder Shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason.\nWarrants - Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or holders are permitted to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under certain circumstances as a result of the Companys failure to have an effective registration statement by the 60th business day after the closing of the initial Business Combination. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of its initial Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after\nthe closing of the Companys initial Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, the Company will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if the Companys Class A common stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \"covered security\" under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \"cashless basis\" in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\nThe warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the \"Newly Issued Price\"), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions) and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of Class A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the initial Business Combination (such price, the \"Market Value\") is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described under \"Redemption of warrants for Class A common stock\" and \"Redemption of warrants for cash\" will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that, (i) they will not be redeemable by the Company, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the Sponsor until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) are subject to registration rights.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00: Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants):\nin whole and not in part;\nat a price of $0.01 per warrant;\nupon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption; and\nif, and only if the last reported sale price of Class A common stock for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (the \"Reference Value\") equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted).\nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. Any such exercise would not be on a cashless basis and would require the exercising warrant holder to pay the exercise price for each warrant being exercised.\nIn no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period or during any Extension Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\nNote 7 - Income Taxes\nThe Companys taxable income primarily consists of interest income on the Trust Account, less any franchise taxes. The Companys formation costs are generally considered start-up costs and are not currently deductible.\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $237,370 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The tax expense is calculated by applying the federal corporate statutory rate of 21% and California corporate statutory rate of 8.84% on $848,246 of earned income from the Trust Account. For the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, the Company had $0 of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income, respectively.\nThe Companys net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nDeferred tax assets (formation costs)\n$\n378,139\nValuation allowance\n(378,139)\nDeferred tax asset, net of allowance\n$\n-\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and is subject to examination by the various taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from March 25, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.\nNote 8 - Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date the financial statements were issued. The Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\nEXHIBIT INDEX\nExhibit\nNo.\nDescription\n1.1\nUnderwriting Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Moelis & Company LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters.(1)\n3.1\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, dated November 10, 2021.(1)\n3.2\nBylaws (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3.3 to the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333.260448)).(2)\n4.1\nSpecimen Unit Certificate.(2)\n4.2\nSpecimen Class A Common Stock Certificate.(2)\n4.3\nSpecimen Warrant Certificate.(2)\n4.4\nWarrant Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent.(1)\n4.5\nDescription of Registered Securities.*\n10.1\nInvestment Management Trust Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee.(1)\n10.2\nRegistration Rights Agreement, dated November10,2021, among the Company and certain security holders named therein.(1)\n10.3\nPrivate Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and the Sponsor.(1)\n10.4\nLetter Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company, the Sponsor and each of the officers, directors and advisory board members of the Company(1)\n10.5\nForm of Indemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and each member of its Advisory Board.(1)\n10.6\nIndemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and John Toth(1)\n10.7\nIndemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Aarti Kapoor(1)\n10.8\nIndemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Angad Hira(1)\n10.9\nIndemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Michael Mauz\u00e9(1)\n10.10\nIndemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Jasmin Allen(1)\n10.11\nIndemnity Agreement, dated November 10, 2021, between the Company and Lowell Singer(1)\n10.12\nPromissory Note issued to VMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC.(2)\n10.14\nSecurities Purchase Agreement between VMG Consumer Acquisition Holdings, LLC and the Registrant.(2)\n10.15\nAdministrative Services Agreement, dated August 6, 2021, between the Company and the Sponsor.(1)\n14.1\nForm of Code of Ethics and Conduct(2)\n31.1\nCertification of the Principal Executive Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a).*\n31.2\nCertification of the Principal Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14(a) or Rule 15d-14(a).*\n32.1\nCertification of the Principal Executive Officer required by Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) and 18 U.S.C. 1350**\nExhibit\nNo.\nDescription\n32.2\nCertification of the Principal Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) and 18 U.S.C. 1350**\n101.INS\nInline XBRL Instance Document - the instance document does not appear in the Interactive Data File because XBRL tags are embedded within the Inline XBRL document.*\n101.SCH\nInline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema Document*\n101.CAL\nInline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase Document*\n101.DEF\nInline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Definition Linkbase Document*\n101.LAB\nInline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase Document*\n101.PRE\nInline XBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation Linkbase Document*\nCover Page Interactive Data File (embedded within the Inline XBRL document)*\n*\nFiled herewith.\n**\nFurnished herewith.\n(1)\nPreviously filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 19, 2021 and incorporated by reference herein.\n(2)\nIncorporated by reference to the Companys Form S-1/A, filed with the SEC on November 5, 2021.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nDecember 22, 2022\nVMG Consumer Acquisition Corp.\nBy:\n/s/ Aarti Kapoor\nName:\nAarti Kapoor\nTitle:\nChief Executive Officer and Director\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\nName\nPosition\nDate\n/s/ Aarti Kapoor\nChief Executive Officer and Director\nDecember 22, 2022\nAarti Kapoor\n/s/ Angad Hira\nChief Financial Officer and Secretary\nDecember 22, 2022\nAngad S.
