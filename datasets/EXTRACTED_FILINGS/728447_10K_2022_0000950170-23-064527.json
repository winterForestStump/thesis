    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nOur Business\nEVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. (EVO and, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Company) is a truckload carrier serving the United States Postal Service (USPS) and other customers. We believe EVO is one of the largest surface transportation companies serving the USPS, with a diversified fleet of tractors, straight trucks and other vehicles that currently operate on either diesel fuel, gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG). EVO also operates a brokerage unit that supports the truckload business and services other corporate customers. In select cases, EVO may subcontract the transportation of certain loads to third-party carriers. We operate from our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona and from numerous terminals throughout the United States.\nHistorically, we have grown primarily through acquisitions and have also grown organically by obtaining new contracts from the USPS and other customers.\nService and Product Offering\nMail Transportation\nWe transport freight for the USPS and believe we are one of its largest ground transportation suppliers. We competitively bid on transportation contracts that specify the movement of freight between processing facilities, distribution centers and other postal locations. Customer contracts with the USPS are typically two to four years in term and may be renewed with the incumbent supplier if appropriate service has been performed in accordance with contract requirements including, but not limited to, USPS performance standards, McNamara-OHara Service Contract Act (SCA) requirements, Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations (federal and state) and all other applicable local and state regulations and if the supplier continues to meet the requirements of the USPS.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we held over 200 contracts with the USPS. Of these contracts, 15 were Dynamic Route Optimization (DRO) contracts and EVO believes it is one of the largest service providers of this contract type. Our mail transportation operations generated $278.5 million in revenue in 2022, or 90% of our total revenues.\nFreight and Brokerage Services\nIn addition to our USPS mail transportation and delivery services, we provide freight and brokerage services to a variety of corporate customers. Our freight and brokerage services generated $31.2 million of revenues in 2022, or 10% of our total revenues.\nHistory\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010 under the name Minn Shares Inc. From December 2010 until November 2016, Minn Shares Inc. was considered a public shell company and dedicated its operations to seeking a potential merger or acquisition partner. On November 22, 2016, Minn Shares Inc. and Titan CNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company in the business of owning and operating compressed natural gas fueling stations (Titan), entered into an agreement and plan of securities exchange whereby the members of Titan acquired approximately 90% of Minn Shares Inc. outstanding shares. Following the closing, the business plan of Titan became the business plan of Minn Shares Inc. and all former officers of Minn Shares Inc. resigned and were replaced by officers designated by Titan. On August 31, 2017, the Company changed its name from Minn Shares Inc. to EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc.\nFollowing the November 2016 public shell reverse merger transaction, the Companys primary strategy was to seek growth through acquisitions. The Company completed the following acquisitions subsequent to November 2016:\nOn February 1, 2017, EVO acquired Environmental Alternative Fuels, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, EVO CNG, LLC. EVO CNG, LLC is engaged in the business of operating compressed natural gas fueling stations.\nOn June 1, 2018, EVO acquired Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc. (Thunder Ridge). Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the truckload carrier business.\nOn November 16, 2018, EVO acquired W.E. Graham, Inc., a trucking company based in Memphis, Tennessee and is engaged in the truckload carrier business.\nOn January 2, 2019, EVO acquired Sheehy Mail, Inc. (Sheehy). Sheehy is based in Waterloo, Wisconsin and is engaged in the truckload carrier business.\nOn February 1, 2019, EVO acquired Ursa Major Corporation (Ursa) and J.B. Lease Corporation (JB Lease). Ursa and JB Lease are based in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and are engaged in the truckload carrier business.\nOn July 15, 2019, EVO acquired Courtlandt and Brown Enterprises L.L.C. (Courtlandt) and Finkle Transport Inc. (Finkle). Finkle and Courtlandt are based in Newark, New Jersey and are engaged in the truckload carrier business.\nOn September 16, 2019, EVO acquired John W. Ritter, Inc. (JWR), Ritter Transportation Systems, Inc. (Ritter Transportation), Ritter Transport, Inc. (Ritter Transport), and Johmar Leasing Company, LLC (Johmar, and together with JWR, Ritter Transportation, and Ritter Transport, the Ritter Companies). The Ritter Companies are based in Laurel, Maryland and are engaged in the truckload carrier business.\nStrategy\nTwo of the top USPS priorities for its supply base are on-time service scores and safety performance. The USPS demands a 95% on-time service score for its suppliers and a satisfactory safety rating, including real-time reporting requirements for accidents. EVOs USPS strategy is anchored around high-performance execution in both of these areas: providing flawless operational excellence and minimizing omitted trips and performing with a best-in-class safety record. We have a dedicated contracting team focused not only on bidding on new contracts but more importantly, providing concierge level service and responding to any and all inquiries from the USPS on a real-time basis. We believe that by executing on these priorities, EVO will continue to be a favored USPS supplier, maximizing new bid opportunities and contract renewal prospects.\nOver the past few years the USPS has consolidated the number of carriers it utilizes and EVO expects further consolidation of this transportation supplier base as the USPS redesigns its network under its Delivering for America plan. As the USPS affects a number of contracting, technology and programmatic changes and requirements, we believe it may become more difficult for suppliers to meet the raised USPS standards. We believe EVOs scale and resources surpass many of our competitors and best position us to successfully bid on large and more complex solicitations. EVO has invested significantly in information systems and personnel that allow us to better manage our USPS contracts and generate data to support day-to-day operations. For example, implementation of a transportation management system (TMS) and a telematics platform has allowed us to meet the scheduling and reporting needs of the USPS. These capabilities are likely to only grow in criticality as the USPS continues to upgrade and transition its systems into the future. EVO plans to continue to invest in solutions that allow us to better compete for additional USPS business currently provided by other suppliers.\nThe USPS adopted a robust environmental sustainability plan that includes a stated commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increased procurement of services from alternative fuels carriers. We intend to continue to evaluate additional vehicles powered by alternative energy, including electrically powered vehicles. We believe our shared commitment with the USPS to reducing emissions positions the Company to grow our business relationship with the USPS in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company was an early participant in the DRO (now LRO) program with the USPS. We believe our existing relationship with the USPS and experience with the LRO program provide the Company additional competitive advantages when bidding on these contracts.\nIn addition to serving the USPS, EVO plans to accelerate its customer diversification efforts, both organically and inorganically through M&A activity. Utilizing our technology platform, fleet, and network, EVO plans to grow its non-USPS business through new customer acquisition and growth of existing customer accounts. By having a more balanced customer base, EVO will be able to better redeploy its capacity and minimize the impact of any losses of USPS contracts or another individual customers business.\nMarket Overview\nCompetition\nIn fiscal year 2022, our largest customer, the USPS spent over $6 billion on ground transportation and transportation services. The USPS ground transportation industry is highly competitive and fragmented. As of 2022, the USPS had over 1,800 local distribution and processing network transportation suppliers. EVO competes primarily with other transportation companies\nfor contracts with the USPS, including both asset and asset-light companies. We believe the USPS is looking to further reduce the number of counterparties it transacts with.\nThe USPS awards its contracts through a competitive bid process and often opts to renew contracts with incumbent service providers if appropriate services have been performed and pricing is competitive with the market. The Company believes that the principal differentiating factors in its business relative to competition, are service, efficiency, technology, pricing, and alternative fuels capabilities. Additionally, the Company was an early participant in the DRO (now LRO) program with the USPS. We believe our existing relationship with the USPS and experience with the LRO program provide the Company additional competitive advantages when bidding on these contracts.\nMore generally, EVO also competes with other trucking and asset light freight companies for the business of non-USPS freight customers.\nOur Target Customers\nThe USPS is our primary customer, but we also seek to provide truckload and brokerage services to other non-USPS corporate clients. While EVO will continue to bid on new USPS contract solicitations, it is focused strategically on adding new customers and growing its non-USPS revenue base to create a more balanced book of business.\nPrincipal Customers and Suppliers\nThe USPS is the Companys primary customer, and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the USPS accounted for approximately 90% and 87%, respectively, of the Companys revenue. As a result, the Companys trucking operations are highly dependent on the USPS. For a discussion of the risks associated with the possible loss of the USPS as a customer or a significant reduction in the Companys relationship with the USPS, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to the Company\nIf we do not generate substantial revenue or obtain sufficient additional capital, we may be unable to pursue our objectives. This raises substantial doubt related to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, numerous factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Specific factors include the following:\nour historical operating losses, net losses and cash used in operations;\ncontinued net losses during 2021 and 2022 after excluding the nonrecurring revenue that resulted from the USPS settlement agreements and the nonrecurring gains that resulted from the extinguishment of certain debt obligations;\ncontinued cash used in operations during 2021 and 2022 after excluding the nonrecurring cash receipts that resulted from the USPS settlement agreements;\ncontinued working capital deficit and stockholders deficit as of September 30, 2023;\nthe structure of our factoring arrangement;\nexisting defaults on certain of our debt obligations; and\nuncertainty regarding our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf we are unable to improve our liquidity position, we might be unable to continue as a going concern. This could significantly reduce or eliminate the value of our investors investment in the Company.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business.\nWe have incurred significant liabilities, and our ongoing capital needs are extensive relative to our current cash position. Unless we are able to restructure some or all of our outstanding debt and/or raise sufficient capital to fund continued operations and our debt obligations, we may be unable to pay these obligations as they become due. In the past, we have been unable to pay our obligations as they have become due.\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nIn 2022, we incurred a net loss of $18.2 million, which included a $5.3 million pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of certain debt obligations. In 2021, we reported net income of $14.3 million, which included $34.8 million of nonrecurring pre-tax revenue resulting from the USPS settlement agreements, as well as a $11.0 million pre-tax gain on the extinguishment of certain debt obligations. We may continue to incur losses, the amount of our losses may increase, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability, any of which would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition and may cause the price of\nEVO's common stock to fall. In addition, to try to achieve or sustain profitability, we may take actions that result in material costs or material asset or goodwill impairments.\nWe have identified seven material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we identified seven deficiencies in internal control that are considered to be material weaknesses and other deficiencies that are considered to be significant deficiencies. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entitys financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. In addition, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, we will be required to expend significant resources to develop the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404, and there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the necessary requirements. The material weaknesses may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. Additionally, if we cannot remediate the material weaknesses in internal controls or if we identify additional material weaknesses in internal controls that cannot be remediated in a timely manner, investors and others with whom we do business may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, and in our ability to obtain equity or debt financing could suffer.\nIn addition, while we expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is a risk that we may not be able to comply timely with all of the requirements imposed by this rule. If we are unable to timely comply with all of these requirements, potential investors might deem our financial statements to be unreliable and our ability to obtain additional capital could suffer.\nWe are heavily reliant on our factoring arrangement, and any reductions to our ability to obtain credit under the factoring arrangement could significantly impact our liquidity.\nWe obtain liquidity under an accounts receivable factoring arrangement with Triumph Business Capital (the \"Factor\"). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, from time to time, we sell to the Factor certain of our accounts receivable balances on a recourse basis for approved accounts. The Factor remits 95% of the contracted accounts receivable balance for a given month to us with the remaining balance, less fees, to be forwarded once the Factor collects the full accounts receivable balance from the factoring customer. This is one of our primary sources of liquidity.\nThe Factor has no obligation to purchase the full amount of accounts receivable balances or unearned future contract amounts that we offer to sell, and there can be no assurance that the Factor will continue to purchase accounts receivable or unearned future contract amounts at the same levels as it has in the past. If the Factor determines in its sole discretion to decrease the amount it advances under the factoring arrangement or to terminate the factoring agreement entirely and we are unable to obtain a replacement source of credit on substantially similar terms, it would significantly decrease our liquidity, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may need substantial additional capital to fund our growth plans and operate our business.\nWe may require substantial additional capital to fund our capital expenditures, service our debt, refinance existing debt, fund strategic relationships, respond to competitive pressures and to otherwise execute on our business plan. The most likely sources of such additional capital are private placements and public offerings of shares of our capital stock, including shares of EVOs common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for EVOs common stock, debt financing or funds from potential strategic transactions. We may seek additional capital from available sources, which may include hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capitalists, lenders/banks and other financial institutions, as well as additional private placements. Any financings in which we sell shares of our capital stock will likely be dilutive to our current stockholders. If we raise additional capital by incurring debt, a portion of our cash flow would have to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness. In addition, typical loan agreements also might contain restrictive covenants that may impair our operating flexibility. Such loan agreements, loans or debentures would also provide for default under certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain financial covenants. A default under a loan agreement could result in the loan becoming immediately due and payable and, if unpaid, a judgment in favor of such lender which would be senior to the rights of our stockholders. A\njudgment creditor would have the right to foreclose on any of our assets resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur ability to raise additional capital may depend in part on our success in meeting sales and operating goals. We currently have no committed sources of additional capital and there is no assurance that additional financing will be available in the amounts or at the times required, or if it is, on terms acceptable or favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if needed, our business will be materially impacted and our investors may lose the value of their entire investment.\nIn the event of an economic downturn or disruption in the credit markets, our indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage in terms of our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nThis could have negative consequences that include: (i) increased vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; (ii) cash flows from operations that are committed to payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing our ability to use cash for our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; (iii) increased interest rates that would affect our variable rate debt; (iv) potential noncompliance with financial covenants, borrowing conditions and other debt obligations, where applicable; (v) lack of financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes; and (vi) limits on our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, market conditions or in the economy.\nWe may experience impairment of our long-lived assets and our goodwill.\nLong-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. We also periodically evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. Once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within operating expense for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value. For assets held and used in the business, management generally determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. For assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs.\nWe depend on certain key personnel, and our operating performance may be adversely impacted by the loss of any such key personnel.\nOur ability to execute our business plans and objectives depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain personnel. In particular, we are dependent upon the services of our management team. Our inability to utilize and retain the services of our management team members could have an adverse effect on us and there would likely be a difficult transition period in finding replacements for any of them. The execution of our strategic plan will place increasing demands on our management and operations. If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of key personnel, our ability to manage our business and implement our strategic plan could be delayed or hindered, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are controlled by our principal stockholder, Antara Capital Master Fund LP, and it appointed two directors to the EVO board of directors.\nOur principal stockholder beneficially owns a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock and it appointed two directors to the EVO board in June 2022. Accordingly, it has the ability to exert substantial influence over our business affairs, including electing directors, appointing officers, determining officers compensation, issuing additional equity securities or\nincurring additional debt, effecting or preventing a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction and amending our articles of incorporation.\nWe incur significant costs to comply with public company reporting requirements and other costs associated with being a public company.\nWe incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Compliance with such rules and regulations increases our administrative costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costlier as compared to our peers that are not subject to public company reporting requirements. As a public company, we are required to comply with rules and regulations of the SEC, including expanded disclosure and more complex accounting rules. We also must implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy these reporting requirements. In addition, we hire additional legal and accounting staff and consultants to enable us to comply with these reporting requirements. These costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and could limit our ability to realize our objectives.\nRisks Related to the Companys Operations\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from one customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nApproximately 90% of our 2022 revenue was generated from the USPS. The loss or reduction of business from this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect the USPS and its ability to remain solvent. The United States Government Accountability Office has in the past described the USPSs financial condition as deteriorating and unsustainable. The USPSs financial difficulties can negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements, especially if the USPS were to delay or default on payments to us.\nThere can be no assurance that our relationship with the USPS will continue as presently in effect. In 2021, the USPS announced its Delivering for America plan to transform the USPS. If we are not able to achieve its business objectives while adhering to the USPSs initiatives under that plan, there would likely be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our contracts with the USPS are terminable for convenience by the USPS upon advance notice ranging from 60 days for some contracts to 180 days for DRO contracts. A default in performance by us under one USPS contract can constitute a cross-default allowing the USPS to terminate some or all of our other contracts with the USPS. A reduction in, or termination of, our services by the USPS would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to execute on our business plans and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur business is capital intensive. Capital expenditures focus primarily on equipment replacement and, to a lesser extent, facilities, equipment growth and investments in information technology. We also expect to devote substantial financial resources to grow our operations and fund our acquisition activities. As a result of our funding requirements, we may need to raise funds through the sale of additional equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements to increase our cash resources. Any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to its stockholders. Public or private financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our growth initiatives or future acquisition activities, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results. In such case, we may also operate our existing equipment (including tractors and trailers) for longer periods, which would result in increased maintenance costs, which would in turn reduce our operating income.\nWe may not successfully manage our recent and planned growth.\nWe have expanded our business through acquiring additional companies that provide contract trucking services to the USPS and leveraging our expanded operations to bid on additional USPS trucking contracts. We plan to continue to expand through acquisitions, bidding on additional USPS trucking contracts and expanding both our freight and brokerage operations in the future. Any expansion of operations we have undertaken or may undertake entail and will entail risks and such actions may involve specific operational activities that may negatively impact our profitability. Consequently, investors must assume the\nrisk that (i) such expansion may ultimately involve expenditures of funds beyond the resources available to us at that time, and (ii) management of such expanded operations may divert managements attention and resources away from its existing operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our present and prospective business activities.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future, which could impede growth, or if we do, we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, a key component of our growth strategy has been to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses. Our growth could be impeded if we do not make any acquisitions. If we make acquisitions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in negotiating, consummating or integrating the acquisitions. If we succeed in consummating future acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially adversely affected because:\nsome of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flows;\nwe may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or otherwise exceed our estimates;\nwe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or at all, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\nacquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and divert our resources;\nwe may experience difficulties operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience;\nwe may incur transactions costs and acquisition-related integration costs;\nwe could lose customers, employees and drivers of any acquired company;\nwe may incur additional indebtedness; and\nwe may issue additional shares of EVOs common stock, which would dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nFailure to successfully implement our cost and revenue initiatives could cause our future financial results to suffer.\nWe are implementing various cost and revenue initiatives to further increase our profitability, including advanced pricing analytics and revenue management tools, cross-selling to strategic accounts, process improvements, workforce productivity and further back-office optimization. If we are not able to successfully implement these cost and revenue initiatives, our future financial results may suffer.\nOur business is affected by general economic and business risks that are largely beyond our control.\nThe trucking industry is cyclical and is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets in general, including excess tractor capacity in comparison with shipping demand and recessionary economic cycles.\nWe are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel prices, driver wages, subcontractor rates, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance, equipment and healthcare for our employees.\nOur suppliers business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints, which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment, parts and services critical to our operations. A significant interruption in the normal supply chain for equipment or parts could disrupt our operations, increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nAdditional events outside of our control, such as strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer, port, border or other shipping locations, or actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements could lead to reduced economic demand, reduced availability of credit or temporary closing of the shipping locations or U.S. borders. Such events or enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nThe trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and our business and results of operations may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing and other competitive pressures.\nWe compete with many truckload carriers of varying sizes, including some that may have greater access to equipment, a wider range of services, greater capital resources, less indebtedness or other competitive advantages. We also compete with smaller, regional service providers that cover specific shipping lanes or that offer niche services. Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve profitability. These factors include the following:\nmany of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, may require us to reduce our freight rates or may limit our ability to maintain or expand our business;\nsome shippers, including the USPS, have reduced or may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting core carriers as approved service providers and in some instances we may not be selected;\nmany customers, including the USPS, solicit bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may depress freight rates or result in a loss of business to competitors;\nthe continuing trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may result in more large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages, and we may have difficulty competing with them;\nadvances in technology may require us to increase investments in our equipment and systems in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments;\nwe may have higher exposure to litigation risks as compared to smaller carriers; and\nsmaller carriers may build economies of scale with procurement aggregation providers, which may improve the smaller carriers abilities to compete with us.\nDriver shortages and increases in driver compensation could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our business.\nDriver shortages could require us to spend more to attract and retain drivers. The market for qualified drivers is intensely competitive, which may subject us to increased payments for driver compensation. Also, because of the competition for drivers, we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers. Compliance and enforcement initiatives included in the CSA program implemented by the FMCSA and regulations of the DOT relating to driver time and safety and fitness could also reduce the availability of qualified drivers. In addition, we experience regular driver turnover, which requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate our existing equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could be required to operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands or be forced to forego business that would otherwise be available to us, which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our business.\nIncreased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new equipment, design changes of new engines, future use of autonomous tractors and volatility in the value of used equipment could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors and trailers. We have at times experienced an increase in prices for new tractors and trailers and the resale value of the tractors have not always increased to the same extent. Prices have increased and may continue to increase, due, in part, to (i) government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines, (ii) increases in commodity prices, (iii) shortages of component parts, such as semiconductors, and (iv) and due to the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers in periods of high demand. Compliance with EPA regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, result in lower fuel mileage and increase our operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as the regulations become effective. Furthermore, future use of autonomous tractors could increase the price of new tractors and decrease the value of used non-autonomous tractors.\nA depressed market for used equipment could require us to trade our revenue equipment at depressed values or to record losses on disposal or impairments of the carrying values of our revenue equipment that is not protected by residual value arrangements. Used equipment prices are subject to substantial fluctuations based on freight demand, supply of new and used equipment,\navailability and terms of financing, the presence of buyers for export to foreign countries and commodity prices for scrap metal. If there is a deterioration of resale prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have seen a softening of the used equipment market recently.\nCertain of our revenue equipment financing arrangements have balloon payments at the end of the finance terms equal to the values we expect to be able to obtain in the used market. To the extent the used market values are lower than such balloon payments, we may be forced to sell the equipment at a loss and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.\nWe are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage, property damage, personal injury, workers compensation, group health and group dental. We have insurance coverage with third-party insurance carriers, but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our self-insured retention and deductibles, which can make our insurance and claims expense higher or more volatile. Additionally, we face the risks of increasing premiums and collateral requirements and the risk of carriers or underwriters leaving the transportation sector, which may materially affect our insurance costs or make insurance more difficult to find, as well as increase our collateral requirements. We could experience increases in our insurance premiums in the future if we decide to increase our coverage or if our claims experience deteriorates.\nIn addition, we are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace and the cost or availability of various types of insurance may change dramatically in the future. If our insurance or claims expense increases, and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our results of operations may also be materially and adversely affected if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, a claim for which coverage is not provided or a covered claim for which our insurance company fails to perform.\nIf we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our recorded liabilities, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe accrue the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims based on estimates derived from our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends. Actual settlement of our retained claim liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties, including evaluation of severity, legal costs and claims that have been incurred but not reported. Due to our high retained amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because our estimates are revised or the claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, applicants, subcontractors, customers, vendors, government agencies, stockholders and other parties through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions and other processes. We and our peers are subject to lawsuits alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, minimum wage, meal and rest periods, overtime eligibility and failure to pay for all hours worked. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by other carriers.\nThe cost to defend, settle and resolve litigation may be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance (including wage and hour claims), and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, involve significant aggregate use of our retention amounts, or cause increases in future premiums, the resulting expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from trucking accidents. The number and severity of litigation claims may be worsened by distracted driving by both truck drivers and other motorists. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and increases of our insurance costs.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which or an inability to keep pace with technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track and complete deliveries; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. Each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, theft or misuse of data, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. We may in the future experience security breaches and other interruptions of our information technology systems despite our best efforts to prevent\nthem. Our efforts to mitigate exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient. A significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems, or those of our technology and communications services vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims or damage to our business reputation.\nWe also could experience an inability to keep pace with technological advances, resulting in our information technology platforms becoming obsolete or our competitors developing related or similar service offerings more effective than ours. Furthermore, we make strategic investments in technology that naturally entail risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. For example, we may not be able to derive value from strategic investments or we may incur higher than expected costs in realizing a return on such investments or overestimate the benefits that we receive or realize from such investments. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that any of our strategic investments will generate anticipated financial returns. If our strategic investments fail to meet our expectations, our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we are currently dependent on a single vendor platform to support certain information technology functions. If the stability or capability of such vendor is compromised and we were forced to migrate to a new platform, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our employees work remotely, which may increase the cybersecurity risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing, and other cybersecurity attacks.\nWe have, and will continue to have, a portion of our employee population that works from home full-time or under flexible work arrangements, and we have provided associates with expanded remote network access options which enable them to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks. Our employees working remotely may expose us to cybersecurity risks through: (i) unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access, including our employees use of Company-owned and personal devices and videoconferencing functions and applications to remotely handle, access, discuss, or transmit confidential information, (ii) increased exposure to phishing and other scams as cybercriminals may, among other things, install malicious software on our systems and equipment and access sensitive information, and (iii) violation of international, federal or state-specific privacy laws. We believe that the increased number of employees working remotely has incrementally increased our cyber risk profile, but we are unable to predict the extent or impacts of those risks at this time. A significant disruption of our information technology systems, unauthorized access to or loss of confidential information, or legal claims resulting from our violation of privacy laws could each have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur agreements with subcontracted operators expose us to risks that we do not face with our company drivers.\nWe rely, in part, upon independent subcontractors to perform the services for which we contract with customers. Our reliance on subcontractors creates numerous risks for our business. If our subcontractors fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise fail to perform in a manner consistent with our requirements, we may be required to utilize alternative service providers at potentially higher prices or with some degree of disruption of the services that we provide to customers. If we fail to deliver on time, if our contractual obligations are not otherwise met, or if the costs of our services increase, then our profitability and customer relationships could be harmed.\nThe financial condition and operating costs of our subcontractors are affected by conditions and events that are beyond our control and may also be beyond their control. Adverse changes in the financial condition of the subcontractors or increases in their equipment or operating costs could cause them to seek higher revenues or to cease their business relationships with us. The prices we charge our customers could be impacted by such issues, which may in turn limit pricing flexibility with customers, resulting in fewer customer contracts and decreasing our revenues.\nIf one of our subcontractors is subject to negative publicity, it could reflect on us and have a material adverse effect on our business, brand and financial performance. Under certain laws, we could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of our subcontractors.\nSubcontractors are third-party service providers, as compared to company drivers who are employed by us. As independent business owners, the subcontractors may make business or personnel decisions that conflict with our best interests. For example, if a load is unprofitable, route distance is too far from home or personal scheduling conflicts arise, a subcontractor may deny loads of freight from time to time. In these circumstances, we must be able to timely deliver the freight in order to maintain relationships with our customers.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs could increase and our ability to compete could be impaired.\nNone of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement; however, we always face the risk that our employees will try to unionize. Further, Congress or one or more states could approve legislation and/or the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with employees, including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization. In addition, we can offer no assurance that the Department of Labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions. We believe the applicability of the SCA to our employees reduces the likelihood of organizational activity.\nAny attempt to organize by our employees could result in increased legal and other associated costs and divert management attention, and if we entered into a collective bargaining agreement, the terms could negatively affect our costs, efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations. In particular, the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects because:\nrestrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency and could impair our service reputation and limit our ability to provide next-day services;\na strike or work stoppage could negatively impact our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships; and\nan election and bargaining process could divert managements time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses.\nHigher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith the passage in 2010 of the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the PPACA), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees who meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. Additionally, some states and localities have passed laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in the health care plans offered by us may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. It is also possible that by making changes or failing to make changes in the health care plans we offer, we will have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, including drivers. The costs and other effects of these healthcare requirements may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events adversely affect our trucking operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel efficiency because of engine idling and adverse road conditions that creates higher accident frequency, increased accident claims and higher cold weather-related equipment maintenance and repair expenditures. We may also suffer from weather-related or other events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions, which may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets or the assets of our customers or otherwise adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could adversely affect our results or make our results more volatile.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, other similar outbreaks and government responses thereto may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued spread and impact of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and government responses thereto might materially negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition. COVID-19 has created, and any other outbreaks of similar contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments could create, significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. COVID-19 or another similar outbreak could negatively impact our business in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\nour revenue may be reduced due to a decrease in demand for our services or the transportation markets in general as a result of the global economic downturn;\nour operations may be disrupted or impaired if a significant portion of our drivers or other employees are unable to work due to illness;\nwe may experience a loss of business or increased costs resulting from supply chain disruptions and changing transportation needs caused by the nationwide emergency response to the pandemic;\nwe may experience workforce issues and incur severance payments as a result of adjusting our workforce to market conditions, and we may subsequently experience retention issues and driver shortages;\nour management may be distracted as they are focused on mitigating the effects of COVID-19 on our business operations while protecting the health of our workforce, which has required, and will continue to require, a large investment of time and resources; and\nwe may be at greater risk for cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of cyberattacks in the current and continuing environment of remote connectivity.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the geographic scope, severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and other actions in response to the pandemic (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates to provide services in a specified manner); the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the response of the overall economy and the financial markets; expenses we have incurred and may incur in the future in connection with our response to the pandemic; the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs; and the potential effects on our internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments. In 2020, services we provide the USPS were deemed essential such that we were required to continue operations during lockdowns and similar restrictive measures limiting business activity generally.\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19, we modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees. Specifically, we implemented measures to enhance the sanitization process of our equipment and properties, increased the social distancing of our employees by working remotely where possible, and provided driving associates with personal protective equipment (PPE). We may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees in the future. The implementation of health and safety practices, including federal or state vaccine mandates and similar measures, could impact our productivity and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward existing or new initiatives or investments, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also exacerbate many of the other risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those relating to our financial performance and debt obligations. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 global pandemic may have, and as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price or availability of diesel fuel and gasoline.\nFuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, environmental laws and regulations, armed conflicts, depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, world supply and demand imbalances, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters, each of which may lead to an increase in the cost of fuel. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Because our operations are dependent upon fuel, significant fuel cost increases, shortages or supply disruptions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although our customers generally reimburse us for fuel expenses, the calculations of those reimbursements typically lag the change in the Department of Energy's fuel index. As a result, those reimbursements might be for amounts lower than our fuel costs as fuel prices fluctuate.\nCosts associated with our use of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) could exceed the related benefits that we are able to realize, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nHigher costs associated with purchasing and repairing NGVs might exceed any benefits attributable to our use of NGVs. For example, there are a limited number of original equipment manufacturers of NGVs and the engines, fuel tanks and other equipment required to upfit a gasoline or diesel engine to run on natural gas, which can increase costs related to purchasing and repairing NGVs as well limit the supply of NGVs available to purchase and therefore our ability to add to our fleet. Also, some of the higher costs of owning and operating NGVs have historically been offset by federal and state government incentives, including those that offset part or all of the additional up-front cost to acquire NGVs or convert vehicles to run on natural gas, those that waive vehicle weight limits for NGVs, and those that offer tax credits. However, those incentives may not continue. If those government incentives are discontinued or not renewed, our operating costs could significantly increase.\nIn addition to potential increases in expenses and other operating costs related to our use of NGVs, if technologies are developed that either reduce the emissions in gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles or improve the operating capabilities of electric, solar or other alternative fuel technology vehicles, the benefits of NGVs could be significantly reduced. Any such reduction could adversely affect our ability to retain existing freight contracts when they are up for renewal and receive new contracts, which would adversely impact our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Governmental Matters\nThe trucking industry is highly regulated and changes in existing laws or regulations, or liability under existing or future laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nWe operate in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT. We, along with our leased labor drivers, must also comply with governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, environmental protection and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, fuel emissions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements and on-board reporting of operations. We may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to such matters that may require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. Possible changes to laws and regulations include:\nincreasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including changes intended to address fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions that are attributed to climate change;\nrestrictions, taxes or other controls on emissions;\nregulation specific to the energy market and logistics providers to the industry;\nchanges in the hours-of-service regulations, which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period;\ndriver and vehicle electronic logging device requirements;\nrequirements leading to accelerated purchases of new tractors, trucks or trailers;\nmandatory limits on vehicle weight and size;\ndriver hiring restrictions;\nincreased bonding or insurance requirements; and\nsecurity requirements imposed by the DHS.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels and emissions, which may increase our or our subcontracted providers operating costs, require capital expenditures or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. In addition, we could lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability guidelines or requirements.\nSafety-related evaluations and rankings under the CSA program could adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nThe CSA program includes compliance and enforcement initiatives designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver. These measurements are scored and used by the FMCSA to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action. The FMCSA issues three categories of safety ratings: satisfactory, conditional and unsatisfactory. As of December 31, 2022, all DOT operating authority numbers operated by us currently have a satisfactory FMCSA rating.\nOur CSA scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience, which could change at any time. In addition, the safety standards prescribed in the CSA program or the underlying methodology used by the FMCSA to determine a carriers safety rating could change and, as a result, our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted. If the FMCSA adopts rulemakings in the future that revise the methodology used to determine a carriers safety rating in a manner that incorporates more stringent standards, then our CSA scores could be adversely affected. If we receive an unacceptable CSA score, our relationships with customers could be damaged, which could result in a loss of business or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe CSA program affects drivers because their safety performance and compliance impact their safety records and, while working for a carrier, will impact their carriers safety record. The methodology for determining a carriers DOT safety rating relies upon implementation of Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASIC) applicable to the on-road safety performance of the carriers drivers and certain of those rating results are provided on the FMCSAs Carrier Safety Measurement System website. As a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for us, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to our peers, and our safety rating could be adversely impacted. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment (in the case of company drivers) or contracts (in the case of third-party drivers) with other carriers, or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with better fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations and productivity. Additionally, we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve our scores as a result of poor rankings. Those carriers and drivers identified under the CSA program as exhibiting poor BASIC scores are prioritized for interventions, such as warning letters and roadside investigations, either of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe requirements of CSA could also shrink the trucking industrys pool of drivers if drivers with unfavorable scores leave the industry. As a result, the costs to attract, train and retain qualified drivers could increase. A shortage of qualified drivers could also increase driver turnover, decrease asset utilization, limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position and financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the operation of fuel storage tanks, release of emissions from our vehicles (including engine idling) and facilities, the health and safety of our workers in conducting operations and adverse impacts to the environment. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, for costs relating to contamination at we own or operate or previously owned or operated and at third-party sites where we disposed of waste, as well as costs associated with the clean-up of releases arising from accidents involving our vehicles. We often operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where soil, groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred from historical or recent releases and for which we may incur remedial or other environmental liabilities. We also maintain aboveground fuel storage tanks at some of our facilities and vehicle maintenance operations at certain of our facilities. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage into the environment, environmental damage and unauthorized hazardous material spills, releases or disposal actions, among others.\nIncreasing efforts to control air emissions, including greenhouse gases, may have an adverse effect on us. Federal and state lawmakers have implemented various climate change initiatives and greenhouse gas regulations and may implement additional initiatives in the future, all of which could increase the cost of new tractors, impair productivity and increase our operating expenses.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may also increase the price of our equipment and otherwise affect the economics of our business by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for, or the costs of providing, transportation services. For example, regulations issued by the EPA and various state agencies that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs. Also, in order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could require us to alter our drivers behavior, purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or face a decrease in productivity. We are also subject to potentially stringent rulemaking related to sustainability practices, including conservation of resources by decreasing fuel consumption. This increased focus on sustainability practices may result in new regulations and/or customer requirements that could adversely impact our business. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf we have operational spills or accidents or if we are found to be in violation of, or otherwise liable under, environmental or worker health or safety laws or regulations, we could incur significant costs and liabilities. Those costs and liabilities may include the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area. The occurrence of any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position and financial condition. Environmental and worker health and safety laws are becoming increasingly more stringent and there can be no assurances that compliance with, or liabilities under, existing or future environmental and worker health or safety laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nIf our subcontractors are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that subcontractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If our subcontractors are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nPotential inquiries into or audits of our Paycheck Protection Program loan, as well as the results of any such inquiries or audits, could have a significant adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nWe applied for and received a $10 million Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan under the CARES Act. On May 8, 2020, we received a letter from the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis of the U.S. House of Representatives demanding that we return the PPP loan. We elected not to return the PPP loan proceeds as requested and our PPP loan was subsequently forgiven. Also, the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) has stated that it intends to audit the PPP loan application of any company, like us, that received PPP loan proceeds of more than $2 million. Our decision to retain the PPP loan may require members of our management team to devote attention to future correspondence and requests from the Select Subcommittee, the SBA, or other regulators, which would reduce the amount of time available to management to focus on our operations and strategic initiatives. If we are later determined to have violated any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP loan, or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nShares of EVO's common stock are thinly-traded on OTC-Expert, and our stockholders may be unable to sell their shares.\nThe shares of EVOs common stock are thinly-traded on OTC-Expert, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our shares of common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. There can be no assurance that a broader or more active trading market will ever develop or, if developed, that it will be sustained. There can be no assurance that EVOs stockholders will ever be able to resell their shares at or near ask prices or at all.\nThe price of EVO's common stock could be highly volatile.\nEVOs common stock will be subject to price volatility, low volumes of trades and large spreads in bid and ask prices quoted by market makers. Due to the low volume of shares traded on any trading day, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence prices of EVOs common stock. This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our stock to fluctuate greatly, with large percentage changes in price occurring in any trading day session. Holders of EVOs common stock may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or may be forced to sell at depressed prices due to low volume trading. If high spreads between the bid and ask prices of EVOs common stock exist at the time of a purchase, the stock would have to appreciate substantially on a relative percentage basis for an investor to recoup their investment. Broad market fluctuations and general economic and political conditions may also adversely affect the market price of EVOs common stock. No assurance can be given that an active market in EVOs common stock will develop or be sustained. If an active market does not develop, holders of EVOs common stock may be unable to readily sell the shares they hold or may not be able to sell their shares at all.\nEVOs common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC, which restrict transactions in our stock and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.\nEVO's common stock is currently regarded as a penny stock because our shares are not listed on a national stock exchange or quoted on the NASDAQ Market within the United States and EVO's common stock has a market price less than $5.00 per share. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, to provide a customer with additional information including current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account, to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. To the extent these requirements may be applicable; they will reduce the level of trading activity in the secondary market for EVO's common stock and may severely and adversely affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell EVO's common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make EVO's common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, as well as a smaller reporting company. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies. These exemptions include:\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure;\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find EVO's common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find EVO's common stock less attractive as a result, we will experience greater difficulty raising equity capital, there may be a less active trading market for EVO's common stock, and the stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have never paid and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our shares.\nWe have never paid cash dividends, and we anticipate that any future profits received from operations will be retained for operations. We do not anticipate the payment of cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future and any decision to pay dividends will depend upon our profitability, available cash and other factors. Therefore, no assurance can be given that there will ever be any cash dividend or distribution in the future.\nWe may in the future issue additional shares of EVO's common stock which would reduce investors ownership interests in EVO and which may dilute EVO's share value.\nEVO's certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 610,000,000 shares consisting of: (i) 600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share; and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The future issuance of all or part of our remaining authorized common stock or preferred stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of EVO's common stock held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for EVO's common stock.\nEVO's certificate of incorporation permits the board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to stockholders.\nEVOs board of directors, without any action by its stockholders, may amend EVOs certificate of incorporation from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that EVO has authority to issue. The board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any class or series of stock. Thus, the board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have a priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of EVOs common stock. For example, the Series C Preferred Stock authorized by the board of directors in March 2022 and the Series D Preferred Stock authorized by the board of directors in July 2022 rank senior in preference and priority to EVO's common stock with respect to dividend and liquidation rights and, generally votes with the common stock on an as converted basis on all matters presented for a vote of the holders of common stock. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock, as well as any other series of preferred stock that the board of directors may authorize in the future could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of EVOs common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nAs a smaller reporting company, EVO is not required to provide disclosure under this item. Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal corporate office is located at 2075 West Pinnacle Peak Rd. Suite 130, Phoenix, AZ 85027 and consists of 6,359 square feet of space.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part I Forward-looking Statements of this Annual Report, and elsewhere in this report. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed.\nCompany Overview\nEVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. is a truckload carrier serving the USPS and other customers. We believe EVO is one of the largest surface transportation companies serving the USPS, with a diversified fleet of tractors, straight trucks and other vehicles that currently operate on either diesel fuel, gasoline or CNG. EVO also operates a brokerage unit that supports the truckload business and services other corporate customers. In select cases, EVO may subcontract the transportation of certain loads to third-party carriers. We operate from our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona and from numerous terminals throughout the United States.\nHistorically, we have grown primarily through acquisitions and have also grown organically by obtaining new contracts from the USPS and other customers.\nKey Trends & Anticipated Future Trends\nUnder its Delivering for America Plan, the USPS is undergoing a massive transformation of its transportation network. A key component of this is a reorganization around regional processing and distribution centers. In addition, the USPS has transitioned most of its air freight to ground networks. We believe the USPS will favor larger and more reliable suppliers that can ensure continued high service performance and continuity during this transition.\nEVO further expects a more active market-based approach to USPS renewals. We believe this approach favors larger suppliers like EVO that can provide competitive pricing by leveraging scale and pricing analytics.\nThe USPS has also started evaluating insourcing opportunities and transitioning contracts to more asset-light companies. We believe outsourced asset-based ground transportation suppliers will continue to service the vast majority of USPS contracts. In addition, we believe any shift in business to these threats is more likely to come from the smaller suppliers who are unable to compete as cost effectively over the long-term.\nWe intend to continue bidding on new and existing USPS contract opportunities as they arise. USPS contracts are bid competitively and performed in accordance with various requirements, including, but not limited to requirements under the Service Contract Act, Department of Transportation regulations (federal and state), and other applicable local and state regulations. The USPS evaluates the bids based on price, past performance, operational plans, financial resources, safety scores and the use of innovation or alternative fuels. EVO's USPS contracts typically have two or four year terms and can be renewed with the incumbent carrier after expiration of the initial term.\nEVO believes that freight market rates peaked during COVID, reaching multi-year highs. Rates have since reversed and EVO believes they will continue to remain challenging during 2023. We believe this may create new business opportunities as the USPS looks to resolicit many of its contracts and that larger, more cost-efficient carriers are well positioned to gain market share. In addition, we believe the USPS will be heavily focused on service performance and that those suppliers who cannot achieve high on time service scores will fall out of favor. We believe this also creates significant opportunity for EVO in the future.\nIn addition to growing the USPS business, the Company expects to further diversify its revenue base both organically through new sales and business development efforts and also through M&A transactions. The strategy of acquiring USPS carriers will be deemphasized as the Company looks to create a more balanced business.\nResults from Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nTrucking revenue: The majority of trucking revenue is derived from the USPS. The remainder of the revenue is primarily derived from corporate freight customers. USPS contracts are typically four years in duration and include a monthly fuel adjustment. Trucking revenue was $309.5 million and $268.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $40.6 million, or 15.1%, increase in trucking revenue from 2021 to 2022 is primarily due to revenue from new USPS contracts, along with increased fuel surcharge revenue as a result of increased fuel prices.\nOther revenue: During the first quarter of 2021, the Company entered into agreements with the USPS to settle claims submitted by the Company seeking additional compensation for transportation services provided under certain DRO contracts. The Company received a total of $28.5 million related to these claims and also renegotiated the contractual rates per mile and total paid miles for some of its DRO contracts on a prospective basis. In addition, amounts totaling $6.3 million that were previously paid by the USPS to the Company during 2020 became subject to the terms of the settlement agreements and were recognized as a deferred gain as of December 31, 2020. The aforementioned amounts totaling $34.8 million were recognized as other revenue during the first quarter of 2021 in the consolidated statement of operations. Such amounts are for transportation services provided during 2020 and prior years, are not subject to refund, and are not contingent upon the Company providing future transportation services. Refer to Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion.\nPayroll, benefits and related: Payroll, benefits and related includes total compensation of drivers and non-drivers. Included in driver compensation is an incremental hourly rate for benefits. Payroll, benefits and related expense was $131.2 million and $107.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $23.8 million, or 22.2%, increase in payroll, benefits and related expense is primarily due to the 15.1% increase in Trucking revenue combined with an increase in the use of employee drivers versus third-party subcontractors.\nPurchased transportation: Purchased transportation represents payments to subcontracted third-party companies. These contracts are typically negotiated on a rate per mile basis and the subcontracting company is responsible for supplying all resources to perform the service including, but not limited to labor, equipment, fuel and associated expenses. Purchased transportation expense was $46.4 million and $68.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $22.4 million, or 32.6%, decrease in purchased transportation expense is primarily due to an increased use of employee drivers versus subcontractors.\nFuel: Fuel expense is comprised of diesel, gasoline and CNG fuel required to operate the fleet. The Company manages fuel cost by negotiating volume discounts from rack fuel rates with select vendors. Fuel expense was $48.2 million and $28.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $20.0 million, or 70.9%, increase in fuel expense is due primarily to the 15.1% increase in Trucking revenue, 32.6% decrease in purchased transportation and an increase in the average DOE fuel price from $3.28 to $5.00 per gallon.\nEquipment rent: The Company rents and leases a portion of its trucks and trailers through a combination of short-term rental arrangements and long-term lease arrangements. Equipment rent expense was $14.6 million and $13.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $1.2 million, or 9.0%, increase in equipment rent expense is primarily due to the need to service new USPS contracts by acquiring additional trucks and trailers via new leasing and rental arrangements.\nMaintenance and Supplies: Maintenance and supplies expense primarily includes the costs to maintain the fleet. Maintenance and supplies expense was $15.8 million and $10.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $4.9 million, or 45.0%, increase in maintenance and supplies expense is primarily due to an increase in the size of the fleet combined with increased maintenance costs for the existing fleet, which the Company is in process of refreshing with newer equipment.\nOperating supplies and expenses: Operating and supplies expenses include all other direct costs in the Trucking operation. Operating supplies and expenses was $14.3 million and $15.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $1.0 million, or 6.5%, decrease in operating supplies and expenses is primarily due to more cost efficient completion of certain routes.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense was $18.0 million and $16.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $1.7 million, or 10.4%, increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees and board of director fees and expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.2 million and $15.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase is due to an increase in finance lease right-of-use asset amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.\nInterest expense: Interest expense was $33.7 million and $12.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The $21.0 million, or 165.4%, increase in interest expense is primarily due to interest expense of $11.9 million associated with the issuance of warrants and the amortization of the debt discount related to the warrants in connection with the Bridge Loan Agreement, dated March 11, 2022. The increase is further due to a $7.7 million charge to interest expense\nassociated with the purchase of warrants by Antara Capital in connection with the recapitalization of the company in September 2022. In addition, the increase is due to $1.6 million of finance fees and additional debt issued of $9 million in connection with the Bridge Loan, and an increase in the interest rate on certain floating rate debt. Refer to Note 5, Debt, and Note 6, Temporary Equity, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants for further discussion.\nGain / loss on extinguishment of debt: The $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the $5.2 million loss on the extinguishment of the four promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million as a result of the Convertible Note Amendments, dated March 11, 2022. The $11.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021 is due to: (1) the $10.1 million gain on extinguishment of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Paycheck Protection Program Loan, which was forgiven by the SBA in July 2021; (2) the $2.5 million gain on the partial extinguishment of the $4.0 million Secured Convertible Promissory Notes during March and April 2021; and (3) the $1.7 million loss on extinguishment resulting from using all of the net proceeds from the Main Street Loan to pay down the aggregate principal amount due under the Financing Agreement (including capitalized interest) from $33.6 million to $16.7 million during the first quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 5, Debt, for further discussion.\nChange in fair value of embedded derivative liability: The Financing Agreement contains a mandatory prepayment feature that was determined to be an embedded derivative, requiring bifurcation and fair value recognition for the derivative liability. The fair value of this derivative liability is remeasured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 5, Debt, and Note 8, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion.\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities: EVO previously issued certain warrants that are not considered indexed to EVO's common stock and, therefore, are required to be classified as liabilities and measured at fair value at each reporting date with the change in fair value being recognized in the Company's results of operations during each reporting period. The change in fair value of substantially all of the warrants classified as liabilities is recognized in other income (expense). Refer to Note 6, Stockholders' Deficit and Warrants, and Note 8, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nChanges in Liquidity\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were $14.4 million and $6.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities was $23.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 which included $28.5 million of nonrecurring cash receipts from the USPS settlement agreements. The decrease in net cash provided was primarily attributable to a $32.5 million increase in net loss, partially offset by a $20.1 million increase in accounts receivable collected.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is primarily related to $0.1 million and $7.4 million of capital expenditures, respectively.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.4 million and $35.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of $258.8 million in payments on factoring arrangements, $5.4 million in payments of debt principal, and $8.8 million in payments on finance lease liabilities, partially offset by $247.5 million in advances from factoring receivables, $9.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and $13.8 million of proceeds from the issuance warrants. The cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of $225.8 million in payments on factoring arrangements, $24.1 million in payments of debt principal, and $5.9 million in payments on finance lease liabilities, partially offset by $214.3 million in advances from factoring receivables and $6.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary historical and future sources of liquidity are cash on hand ($14.4 million at December 31, 2022), the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the sale of EVOs common stock or preferred stock, and advances under our accounts receivable factoring arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing in the future via the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the sale of EVOs common stock or preferred stock.\nUses of Liquidity\nOur business requires substantial amounts of cash for operating activities, including salaries and wages paid to our employees, contract payments to independent contractors, and payments for fuel, maintenance and supplies, and other expenses. We also use large amounts of cash and credit for principal and interest payments, as well as operating and finance lease liabilities and capital expenditures to fund the replacement and/or growth in our tractor and trailer fleet.\nGoing Concern\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $14.4 million, a working capital deficit of $67.2 million, stockholders deficit of $15.7 million, and material debt and lease obligations of $105.6 million, which included term loan borrowings under a financing agreement with Antara Capital. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 million and net loss of $18.2 million that included a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThe following significant transactions and events affecting the Companys liquidity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022:\nOn March 11, 2022, EVO and certain subsidiary guarantors of the Company entered into a Senior Secured Loan and Executive Loan Agreement (the \"Bridge Loan Agreement\") with Antara Capital and Thomas J. Abood, EVO's former chief executive officer, Damon R. Cuzick, EVO's former chief operating officer, Bridgewest Growth Fund LLC, an entity affiliated with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr., EVO's executive vice president - business development, and Batuta Capital Advisors LLC (\"Batuta\" and together with Mr. Abood, Mr. Cuzick and Bridgewest Growth Fund LLC, the \"Executive Lenders\"), an entity affiliated with Alexandre Zyngier, a member of EVO's board of directors (the Board). Pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, EVO obtained a bridge loan in the amount of $9.0 million (the \"Bridge Loan\") from Antara Capital and also borrowed $0.8 million (the \"Executive Loans\") from the Executive Lenders. Refer to Note 5, Debt, for further discussion. Pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, on March 11, 2022, Antara Capital appointed Michael Bayles as a member of EVO's Board, effective immediately. Mr. Bayles was appointed to fill a newly-created vacancy on the Board.\nOn March 11, 2022, and pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, EVO filed a Certificate of Designations of Series C Non-Participating Preferred Stock (the \"Series C Certificate of Designations\") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which authorized EVO to issue up to one share of Series C Preferred Stock, and issued to Antara Capital one share of Series C Preferred Stock. Refer to Note 6, Temporary Equity for further discussion.\nOn March 11, 2022, EVO entered into amendments to certain secured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million to permit immediate conversion of those notes, and the holders converted those notes into warrants to purchase 7,533,750 shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share.\nOn May 31, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Loan Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from May 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from June 3, 2022 to July 7, 2022.\nOn June 30, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Second Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from June 30, 2022 to July 8, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 7, 2022 to July 15, 2022.\nOn July 8, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Third Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from July 8, 2022 to July 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 15, 2022 to July 22, 2022. In addition, the Third Extension Agreement stipulated that on or before July 13, 2022, the Board of Directors of EVO shall have duly approved and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations to evidence the issuance of a new series of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value, that will, upon issuance, entitle Antara Capital (in its capacity as sole holder of the Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock) to vote such number of votes per share that will allow Antara Capital to exercise 51% of the voting capital stock of EVO.\nOn July 13, 2022, and pursuant to the Third Extension Agreement dated July 8, 2022, EVO filed a Certificate of Designations of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Certificate of Designations\") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which authorized EVO to issue up to one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock. Refer to Note 6, Stockholders' Deficit for further discussion.\nThe issuance of one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock to Antara Capital on July 13, 2022 resulted in a change of control of the Company, with Antara Capital having voting control on Series D Shareholder Matters. The consideration for the issuance of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock to Antara Capital was Antara Capital's agreement to enter into the Third Extension Agreement, and the Company did not receive any cash consideration.\nOn July 15, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Fourth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from July 15, 2022 to August 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 22, 2022 to August 22, 2022.\nOn August 12, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Fifth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from August 15, 2022 to September 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from August 22, 2022 to September 22, 2022.\nOn September 8, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders, in contemplation of the Securities Purchase Agreement discussed below, entered into a Sixth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from September 15, 2022 to December 29, 2023 and the Executive Loans maturity date from September 22, 2022 to January 5, 2024.\nOn September 8, 2022, EVO and Antara Capital entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and consummated certain transactions involving the recapitalization of the Company. This includes the sale and issuance of new equity by EVO and the cancellation of certain indebtedness in exchange for equity of EVO and/or its subsidiaries. For more information regarding the Securities Purchase Agreement and the transactions, refer to the heading Securities Purchase Agreement within Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nOn December 23, 2022, Antara Capital, the Executive Lenders, Corbin ERISA Opportunity Fund Ltd (\"CEOF\") and Hudson Park amended and restated the Bridge Loan to reflect the assigned portions of the Bridge Loan to CEOF and Hudson Park. No changes were made to the Bridge Loan in connection with the assignment to CEOF and Hudson Park and no payments were made to the holders of the debt. This event is a transaction among debt holders.\nDespite the occurrence of the Recapitalization Transactions, the Company believes its existing cash, together with any positive cash flows from operations, may not be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months, and the Company may be required to seek additional financing from outside sources.\nIn evaluating the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and its potential need to seek additional financing from outside sources, management also considered the following conditions:\nThe counterparty to the Companys accounts receivable factoring arrangement is not obligated to purchase the Companys accounts receivable or make advances to the Company under such arrangement;\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is not in compliance with certain covenants in its debt agreements (Refer to Note 5, Debt, for further discussion); and\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing in the future via the incurrence of additional indebtedness or via the sale of EVOs common stock or preferred stock.\nAs a result of the circumstances described above, the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to make the required payments on its debt, factoring or leasing obligations; to satisfy future operating expenses; to make capital expenditures; or to provide for other cash needs.\nManagements plans to mitigate the Companys current conditions include:\nCost reduction efforts;\nImprovements to operations to gain driver efficiencies;\nPurchases of trucks and trailers to reduce purchased transportation and truck rental expenses;\nReplacement of older trucks with newer trucks to lower the overall cost of ownership and improve cash flow through reduced maintenance and fuel costs;\nNegotiating with related parties and third parties to refinance existing debt and lease obligations;\nPotential future public or private debt or equity offerings;\nAcquiring new profitable contracts and negotiating revised pricing for existing contracts; and\nProfitably expanding trucking revenue.\nNotwithstanding managements plans, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to address its current liquidity and capital resource constraints. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements within EVOs Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nRefer to Notes 1, 4, 5 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt, factoring, and lease obligations, including the future maturities of such obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nRefer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Arrangements - Captive Insurance.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. All of the Companys goodwill is recorded in its Trucking reporting unit.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss.\nThe impairment test process requires valuation of the reporting unit, which we determine using primarily the income, or discounted cash flows, approach. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting units discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the annual impairment test did not result in an impairment of goodwill.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. The Company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value is measured based on quoted market prices, if available.\nIf quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the asset groups long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. An asset groups discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.\nFair Valuation of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Warrants and Stock Options\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially own a substantial majority of EVOs outstanding common stock. EVOs common stock does not have an observable quoted market price on the OTC Expert Market because the stock is thinly traded and is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. As a result, we must utilize an alternative method to estimate the fair value of our common stock, including when EVO issues other equity instruments for which the common stock is the underlying security. We first use primarily the income or discounted cash flows approach to determine the estimated fair value of our total equity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the Company's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. The discount rate utilized is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. We then use the option-pricing equity allocation method to allocate the estimated total equity value to our common stock and preferred stock. The inputs and assumptions used in the option-pricing model include: (1) the discount rate; (2) the estimated time to liquidity; (3) EVO's expected stock price volatility; (4) the estimated discount for the lack of marketability; and (5) the risk-free interest rate. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The estimated fair value of EVOs common stock is a key assumption in the fair valuation of the preferred stock, warrants and stock options EVO issues.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the estimated fair value of EVOs common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award. The expected term represents the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the awards, we use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for our stock-based compensation awards. Under the simplified method, the expected term of an award is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the awards. We assume no dividend yield because dividends on our common stock are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends on our common stock.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards and are based on managements assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income, as well as managements judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards. The carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on managements interpretations of applicable tax laws and incorporate managements assumptions and judgments regarding the\nuse of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-term business forecasts to provide insight. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating losses of approximately $38.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating losses of approximately $44.7 million and $30.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $0.7 million of federal net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for 20 years and will begin to expire in 2036. The remaining $37.7 million of federal net operating losses are carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income up to an 80% limitation of taxable income in the year of use. The state net operating losses began to expire in 2022. These federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a full valuation allowance because, based on the available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. If the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nDue to increased USPS volume associated with the holiday rush from the end of November through year end, the Companys revenue and business activity typically increase during the last quarter of each calendar year. In the winter months, operating expenses generally increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures.\nThe Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy the Companys assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of customers, any of which could adversely affect the Companys results or make the Companys results more volatile.\nThe Company has experienced inflationary pressures in the normal course of business including cost of equipment, driver wages, healthcare and benefits, insurance, parts and supplies and fuel. While the Company receives some revenue offsets from the USPS for costs like wage inflation and fuel, periods with inflationary pressures could adversely affect our financial results. Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm [PCAOB ID Number 248]\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nEVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Companys current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $67.2 million and its total liabilities exceeded its total assets by $15.7 million as of December 31, 2022. These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements evaluation of the events and conditions and managements plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nNovember 16, 2023\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash\n$\n14,429\n$\n6,325\nAccounts receivable -

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nEVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. (EVO and, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Company) is a truckload carrier serving the USPS and other customers. We believe EVO is one of the largest surface transportation companies serving the USPS, with a diversified fleet of tractors, straight trucks and other vehicles that currently operate on either diesel fuel, gasoline or CNG. EVO also operates a brokerage unit that supports the truckload business and services other corporate customers. In select cases, EVO may subcontract the transportation of certain loads to third-party carriers. We operate from our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona and from numerous terminals throughout the United States.\nHistorically, we have grown primarily through acquisitions and have also grown organically by obtaining new contracts from the USPS and other customers.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn September 8, 2022, EVO, EVO Holding Company, LLC (EVO Holding), a subsidiary of EVO, and Antara Capital Master Fund LP (Antara Capital) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA) and consummated certain transactions involving the recapitalization of the Company (collectively the Recapitalization Transactions). This included the following:\nEVO adopted an amendment to the certificate of incorporation to effect the increase in the number of authorized shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001, from 100 million to 600 million (the Charter Amendment). See Note 6, Temporary Equity, Stockholders' Deficit and Warrants, for more information.\nAntara Capital agreed to pay EVO $13.5 million to purchase 22,353,696 immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 22,353,696 shares of common stock of EVO at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, 319,213,143 warrants to purchase 319,213,143 shares of common stock of EVO at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share that was exercisable following the adoption of the Charter Amendment, and 1 convertible preferred membership interest in EVO Holding. The Company recorded a $7.7 million loss to interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 in connection with the issuance of the warrants. Upon exercise of the warrants, which occurred in November 2022, Antara Capital owned approximately 69% of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The preferred interest is convertible into 99% of the common membership interests of EVO Holding, if the Company fails to meet certain financial conditions, at Antara Capitals election during the Conversion Period, defined below under the heading Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement. EVO Holding maintains the Companys ownership interests in John W. Ritter Trucking, Inc. and its related companies (the \"Ritter Companies\"), which provide a material portion of our Trucking revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Ritter provided approximately 18% and 20% of our Trucking revenue, respectively. See Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants, for more information regarding the issued warrants.\nIn connection with the SPA, EVO entered into exchange agreements (the Exchange Agreements) with certain creditors, defined in Note 3, Related Party Transactions. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, the creditors agreed to exchange promissory notes in the aggregate amount of principal and accrued interest of approximately $18.3 million for 71,324,670 warrants to purchase common stock and new promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.7 million (the Takeback Notes). See Note 3, Related Party Transactions, Note 5, Debt, and Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants, for more information.\nEVO issued warrants to purchase 4,754,978, 9,509,956 and 3,000,000 shares of EVO's common stock at exercise prices of $0.0001, $0.53 and $1.50 per share, respectively, to two former board members. See Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants, for more information regarding the issued warrants.\nEVO issued warrants to purchase 23,224,117 shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.63 per share to key equity holders and members of management. Each warrant issued may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, pursuant to the terms of such warrants, for a period of five years from the date of issuance. See Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants, for more information regarding the issued warrants.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAmended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement\nIn connection with the SPA, EVO, Antara Capital, and EVO Holding entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the A&R LLC Agreement) for EVO Holding. Pursuant to the A&R LLC Agreement and the SPA, EVO Holding issued one convertible preferred membership interest in EVO Holding (the Preferred Interest) to Antara Capital. The Preferred Interest is convertible at Antara Capitals election during the Conversion Period into 99% of the common membership interests of EVO Holding. The Conversion Period is defined as each date of determination on which (i) Consolidated EBITDA for EVO and its subsidiaries for the most recently completed fiscal quarter that is the first, second or third fiscal quarter is less than $6.0 million, with such determination initially being made with respect to the second fiscal quarter of 2023, (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for EVO and its subsidiaries for the most recent fourth fiscal quarter that is one of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters is less than $9.0 million, (iii) EVO or any of its subsidiaries fails to pay any principal or interest due in respect of any debt with an outstanding aggregate principal amount in excess of $1.0 million when due, subject to certain cure rights, (iv) any debt of EVO or any of its subsidiaries with an outstanding aggregate principal amount in excess of $1.0 million becomes due prior to its stated maturity, (v) EVO has failed to deliver unaudited quarterly financial statements with certain prescribed time periods, or (vi) EVO has failed to deliver audited annual financial statements within certain prescribed time periods.\nGoing Concern\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had a cash balance of $14.4 million, a working capital deficit of $67.2 million, stockholders deficit of $15.7 million, and material debt and lease obligations of $105.6 million, which included term loan borrowings under a financing agreement with Antara Capital. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported cash provided by operating activities of $10.6 million and net loss of $18.2 million that included a $5.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt.\nThe following significant transactions and events affecting the Companys liquidity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022:\nOn March 11, 2022, EVO and certain subsidiary guarantors of the Company entered into a Senior Secured Loan and Executive Loan Agreement (the \"Bridge Loan Agreement\") with Antara Capital and Thomas J. Abood, EVO's former chief executive officer, Damon R. Cuzick, EVO's former chief operating officer, Bridgewest Growth Fund LLC, an entity affiliated with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr., EVO's executive vice president - business development, and Batuta Capital Advisors LLC (\"Batuta\" and together with Mr. Abood, Mr. Cuzick and Bridgewest Growth Fund LLC, the \"Executive Lenders\"), an entity affiliated with Alexandre Zyngier, a member of EVO's board of directors (the Board). Pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, EVO obtained a bridge loan in the amount of $9.0 million (the \"Bridge Loan\") from Antara Capital and also borrowed $0.8 million (the \"Executive Loans\") from the Executive Lenders. Refer to Note 5, Debt, for further discussion. Pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, on March 11, 2022, Antara Capital appointed Michael Bayles as a member of EVO's Board, effective immediately. Mr. Bayles was appointed to fill a newly-created vacancy on the Board.\nOn March 11, 2022, and pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, EVO filed a Series C Certificate of Designations of Series C Non-Participating Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which authorized EVO to issue up to one share of Series C Preferred Stock, and issued to Antara Capital one share of Series C Preferred Stock. Refer to Note 6, Temporary Equity, Stockholders' Deficit and Warrants for further discussion.\nOn March 11, 2022, EVO entered into amendments to certain secured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million to permit immediate conversion of those notes, and the holders converted those notes into warrants to purchase 7,533,750 shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share.\nOn May 31, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Loan Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from May 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from June 3, 2022 to July 7, 2022.\nOn June 30, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Second Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from June 30, 2022 to July 8, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 7, 2022 to July 15, 2022.\nOn July 8, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Third Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from July 8, 2022 to July 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 15, 2022 to July 22, 2022. In addition, the Third Extension Agreement stipulated that on or before July 13, 2022, the Board of Directors of EVO shall have duly approved and filed with the Secretary of State of the State\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nof Delaware a Certificate of Designations to evidence the issuance of a new series of Series D Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value (the Series D Preferred) that will, upon issuance, entitle Antara Capital (in its capacity as sole holder of the Series D Preferred) to vote such number of votes per share that will allow Antara Capital to exercise 51% of the voting capital stock of EVO.\nOn July 13, 2022, and pursuant to the Third Extension Agreement dated July 8, 2022, EVO filed a Certificate of Designations of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which authorized EVO to issue up to one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock. Refer to Note 6, Stockholders' Deficit and Warrants for further discussion.\nThe issuance of one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock to Antara Capital on July 13, 2022 resulted in a change of control of the Company, with Antara Capital having voting control on Series D Shareholder Matters. The consideration for the issuance of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock to Antara Capital was Antara Capital's agreement to enter into the Third Extension Agreement, and the Company did not receive any cash consideration.\nOn July 15, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Fourth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from July 15, 2022 to August 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 22, 2022 to August 22, 2022.\nOn August 12, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Fifth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from August 15, 2022 to September 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from August 22, 2022 to September 22, 2022.\nOn September 8, 2022, EVO, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders, in contemplation of the SPA discussed above, entered into a Sixth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from September 15, 2022 to December 29, 2023 and the Executive Loans maturity date from September 22, 2022 to January 5, 2024.\nOn September 8, 2022, EVO and Antara Capital entered into the SPA and consummated the Recapitalization Transactions. For more information regarding the SPA and the Recapitalization Transactions, refer to the heading Securities Purchase Agreement above.\nOn December 23, 2022, Antara Capital, the Executive Lenders, CEOF and Hudson Park amended and restated the Bridge Loan to reflect the assigned portions of the Bridge Loan to CEOF and Hudson Park. No changes were made to the Bridge Loan in connection with the assignment to CEOF and Hudson Park and no payments were made to the holders of the debt. This event is a transaction among debt holders.\nIn evaluating the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and its potential need to seek additional financing from outside sources, management also considered the following conditions:\nThe counterparty to the Companys accounts receivable factoring arrangement is not obligated to purchase the Companys accounts receivable or make advances to the Company under such arrangement;\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is not in compliance with certain covenants in its debt agreements (Refer to Note 5, Debt, for further discussion); and\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing in the future via the incurrence of additional indebtedness or via the sale of EVOs common stock or preferred stock.\nAs a result of the circumstances described above, the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to make the required payments on its debt, factoring or leasing obligations; to satisfy future operating expenses; to make capital expenditures; or to provide for other cash needs.\nManagements plans to mitigate the Companys current conditions include:\nCost reduction efforts;\nImprovements to operations to improve driver productivity;\nPurchases of trucks and trailers to reduce purchased transportation and rental vehicles;\nReplacement of older trucks with newer trucks to lower the overall cost of ownership and improve cash flow through reduced maintenance and fuel costs;\nNegotiating with related parties and third parties to refinance existing debt and lease obligations;\nPotential future public or private debt or equity offerings;\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAcquiring new profitable contracts and negotiating revised pricing for existing contracts; and\nProfitably expanding trucking revenue.\nNotwithstanding managements plans, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to address its current liquidity and capital resource constraints. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements within EVOs Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nRefer to Notes 4, 5, and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our factoring, debt, and lease obligations, including the future maturities of such obligations. Refer to Note 13, Subsequent Events, for further information regarding changes in the Companys debt obligations and liquidity subsequent to December 31, 2022.\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EVO and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nPushdown Accounting\nAs described in Note 5, Debt, on July 13, 2022, Antara Capital was issued one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock of EVO. With the issuance of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock, Antara Capital obtained voting control on shareholder matters resulting in a change of control of the Company. Antara Capital elected to not apply pushdown accounting.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period's financial information to conform to the current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include some amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgments. The most significant estimates relate to goodwill and long-lived asset valuations, purchase price allocations related to the Companys business combinations, valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, and the valuation of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants and stock-based awards.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts where accounts may exceed federally insured limits at times. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nRestricted Cash\nWe had restricted cash of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 which represents cash required to be set aside by a standby letters of credit related to workers compensation and general liabilities accrued in our condensed consolidated financials. Restricted cash is included in deposits and other long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, for further details around the letters of credit.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Companys estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of the accounts receivable. It is reasonably\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\npossible that the Companys estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change and that losses ultimately incurred could differ materially from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance. Receivable balances are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company grants credit in the normal course of business to customers in the United States. The Company periodically performs credit analysis and monitors the financial condition of its customers to reduce credit risk.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the USPS accounted for 51% and 47% of the consolidated trade accounts receivable balance, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the USPS generated revenue represented 90% and 89%, respectively, of total trucking revenue and 90% and 89%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated total revenue. The USPS is operated by the United States Federal government; therefore, the Company does not believe there is significant credit or collections risk related to the accounts receivable balance due from the USPS. If the Company were to lose its relationship, or is unable to renew existing contracts, with the USPS, it would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals of equipment are included in operations as they are a normal, recurring component of our operations. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.\nYears\nTractors\n4 - 10\nTrailers\n4 - 14\nEquipment\n5 - 10\nLeasehold improvements\n5 - 10\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. All of the Companys goodwill is recorded in the Trucking reporting unit, which has a negative carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for 2022 and 2021 by completing quantitative impairment analyses of the Trucking reporting unit goodwill, and management concluded the goodwill was not impaired.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company's intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names and non-competition agreements. The Company carries these intangible assets at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Management reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. There were no indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to forecasted undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nwhich the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCertain fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing are capitalized and included as a reduction in the carrying value of the related debt in the consolidated balance sheets, net of accumulated amortization. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt.\nFair Valuation of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Warrants and Stock Options\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially own a substantial majority of EVOs outstanding common stock. EVOs common stock does not have an observable quoted market price on the OTC Expert Market because the stock is thinly traded and is not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotations. As a result, we must utilize an alternative method to estimate the fair value of our common stock, including when EVO issues other equity instruments for which the common stock is the underlying security. We first use primarily the income, or discounted cash flows, approach to determine the estimated fair value of our total equity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the Company's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. The discount rate utilized is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. We then use the option-pricing equity allocation method to allocate the estimated total equity value to our common stock and preferred stock. The inputs and assumptions used in the option-pricing model include: (1) the discount rate; (2) the estimated time to liquidity; (3) EVO's expected stock price volatility; (4) the estimated discount for the lack of marketability; and (5) the risk-free interest rate. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The estimated fair value of EVOs common stock is a key assumption in the fair valuation of the preferred stock, warrants and stock options EVO issues.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting period and accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nSome of EVOs currently outstanding awards provide for the acceleration of vesting of all shares underlying the award upon the occurrence of the Company completing an aggregate of at least $30 million of any combination of debt and/or equity financing transactions after the date of grant. Since such financing transactions are outside the Companys control, the Company does not deem the performance condition to be probable of achievement until the cumulative financing transactions have been completed. Once the cumulative financing transactions have been completed and the vesting of the awards is accelerated, the Company accelerates its recognition of stock-based compensation expense and records any previously unrecognized compensation cost associated with the affected awards on such date.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nEarnings (Loss) per Share of Common Stock\nBasic earnings (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible notes payable and preferred stock using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (amounts in thousands, except share data):\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(18,226\n)\n$\n14,253\nAccrued and undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears\n(323\n)\n(651\n)\nInducement to convert preferred stock into common stock\n(153\n)\n-\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders - numerator for basic EPS\n(18,702\n)\n13,602\nEffect of dilutive securities:\n$4.0 million Secured Convertible Promissory Notes\n-\nSeries A Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock\n-\nSeries B Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock\n-\nSubtotal\n-\nAdjusted net income (loss) available to common stockholders - numerator for diluted EPS\n$\n(18,702\n)\n$\n14,538\nDenominator:\nDenominator for basic EPS - weighted average common shares outstanding\n171,700,395\n30,507,308\nEffect of dilutive securities:\n$4.0 million Secured Convertible Promissory Notes\n-\n527,736\nSeries A Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock\n-\n132,647\nSeries B Redeemable Convertible Preferred stock\n-\n2,208,384\nSubtotal\n-\n2,868,767\nDenominator for diluted EPS - adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding\n171,700,395\n33,376,075\nBasic EPS\n$\n(0.11\n)\n$\n0.45\nDiluted EPS\n$\n(0.11\n)\n$\n0.44\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders, because either their effect was anti-dilutive or they are contingently issuable shares that were not issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\nStock options\n9,627,942\n10,920,249\nWarrants\n72,011,885\n12,606,255\nCommon stock to be issued upon conversion of Four convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million\n-\n7,516,250\nCommon stock and warrant to be issued for purchase of fixed assets\n2,348,000\n2,348,000\nTotal\n83,987,827\n33,390,754\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRevenue Recognition\nUSPS - USPS trucking operations generates revenue from transportation services under multi-year contracts with the USPS.\nContract Identification - Although the Company has master agreements with the USPS, these master agreements only establish general terms. Each delivery represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation for each contract. A single delivery may comprise multiple stops prior to completion. Therefore, a legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the first point of pickup for each delivery.\nPerformance Obligations - The Companys performance obligation arises from the annualized contract to transport USPS freight and is satisfied upon completion of each delivery. The Companys delivery, accessorial, and dedicated truck capacity represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another. Thus, the Companys only performance obligation of USPS trucking operations is transportation services.\nTransaction Price - The transaction price is based on the awarded agreement for the multi-year contract. The prices are based on miles travelled that adjust monthly for fuel pricing indexes. Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel adjustments, accessorial fees and fees for additional deliveries outside of the scope of the annual contract. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the USPS generally pays within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 60 days.\nAllocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to transportation services, as this is the only performance obligation.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized over time as satisfaction of the promised contractual delivery agreements are completed, in an amount that reflects the fixed price or the rate per mile set in the contract. Generally, the Company does not have material revenue in transit at period end.\nFreight\nContract Identification - A legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the point of pickup at the shippers location, as evidenced by a bill of lading. Although the Company may have master agreements with its customers, these master agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the load is tendered/accepted and the Company takes possession of the load.\nPerformance Obligations - The Companys only performance obligation for freight trucking operations is transportation services. The Companys delivery, accessorial, and dedicated truck capacity represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another and the Company does not offer them on a stand-alone basis.\nTransaction Price - Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel adjustments, and accessorial fees. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the customers generally pay within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 120 days.\nAllocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to transportation services, as this is the only performance obligation.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized over time as satisfaction of the promised contractual delivery agreements are completed. Generally, the Company does not have material revenue in transit at period end.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606-10-50, the Company disaggregates Trucking revenue from contracts with its customers between USPS revenue and Freight revenue as follows:\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\nUSPS revenue\n$\n278,262\n$\n235,926\nFreight revenue\n26,213\n26,578\nOther revenue\n5,001\n6,409\nTotal Trucking revenue\n$\n309,476\n$\n268,913\nUnited States Postal Service Settlement\nOn January 19, 2021, the Company and the USPS entered into a settlement agreement whereby the USPS agreed to pay approximately $7.1 million to one of EVOs subsidiaries as additional compensation for transportation services provided to the\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nUSPS under certain DRO contracts. Subsequently, on February 19, 2021, the Company and the USPS entered into an additional settlement agreement whereby the USPS agreed to pay approximately $17.5 million to certain other Company subsidiaries as additional compensation for transportation services provided to the USPS under other DRO contracts. In connection with the settlement agreements, the Company and the USPS agreed to make certain adjustments to the Companys DRO contracts, including rate adjustments effective for the fourth quarter of 2020 and future periods. As a result of those adjustments, the USPS agreed to pay an additional $3.8 million to the Company for transportation services provided in the fourth quarter of 2020. The USPS has made all payments associated with these settlement agreements and they were received by the Factor (as defined in Note 4, Factoring Arrangements) on behalf of the Company during the first quarter of 2021. In addition, amounts totaling $6.3 million that were previously paid by the USPS to the Company during 2020 became subject to the terms of the settlement agreements and were recognized as a deferred gain as of December 31, 2020. All aforementioned amounts totaling $34.8 million were recognized as other revenue during the first quarter of 2021 in the consolidated statement of operations. Such amounts are for transportation services provided during 2020 and prior years, are not subject to refund and are not contingent upon the Company providing future transportation services.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company uses the \"management approach\" to determine its operating and reportable segments. The management approach focuses on the financial information that the Company's chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate performance and allocate resources to the Company's operations. Historically, the Company had two reportable segments-Trucking and CNG Fueling Stations. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company determined that its business operates as one reportable segment because: (i) the Company measures profit and loss as a whole; (ii) the principal decision makers do not review information based on any operating segment; (iii) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around different products and services; (iv) the Company has not chosen to organize its business around geographic areas; and (v) the revenues, profits, assets and liabilities of the CNG Fueling Stations are immaterial for all periods presented.\nLoss Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation, claims, contingencies and other legal matters. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency borne by the Company when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequence for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income.\nIn evaluating the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Management establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be utilized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income, which must occur prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the tax benefit or expense from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest and penalties associated with tax positions are recorded within income tax expense. Tax years that remain subject to examination include 2019 through the current year for federal and generally 2018 through the current year for state purposes.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments (Topic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which clarifies existing guidance for freestanding written call options which are equity classified and remain so after they are modified or exchanged in order to reduce diversity in practice. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements to be Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new guidance changes the accounting for estimated credit losses pertaining to certain types of financial instruments including, but not limited to, trade and lease receivables. This pronouncement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption of the guidance is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if-converted method be applied for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the standard requires using either the modified retrospective or the retrospective approach.

Under the agreement, the Company paid a monthly fee for this technology based on the number of devices installed across the Companys fleet. The agreement was terminated in September 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized expense of approximately $0 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to this software technology, and $0 million and $0.1 was owed as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSheehy Settlement Agreement\nOn September 27, 2022, EVO, Sheehy Mail Contractors, Inc. (\"Sheehy\"), Sheehy Enterprises, Inc. (SEI), North American Dispatch Systems, LLC (NADS), John Sheehy (J. Sheehy), Robert Sheehy (R. Sheehy and, together with SEI, NADS, and J. Sheehy, the Sheehy Parties) entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Sheehy Settlement Agreement) which consummated the following: (i) terminated the services agreement with NADS with the receipt of $0.1 million over multiple installments through August 31, 2023; (ii) Sheehy agreed to pledge $0.8 million in cash collateral held in the SEI captive insurance member account, under the CSPA, on or before March 1, 2024; (iii) modified an equipment lease between Sheehy and SEI; and (iv) SEI waived and agreed to not exercise the $1.2 million put right with the receipt of $0.1 million over multiple installments through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, EVO is no longer obligated to redeem the common stock held by SEI. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, redeemable common stock was $0 and $1.2 million, respectively.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements - Collateral Security Pledge Agreement\nOn January 2, 2019 EVO acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Sheehy. Sheehy is engaged in the business of fulfilling government contracts for freight trucking services, as well as providing freight trucking services to non-government entities. On January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a letter agreement with SEI, to satisfy the Sheehy captive insurance security deposit requirement for 2019 (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Arrangements - Captive Insurance). The letter agreement references a Collateral Security Pledge Agreement among SEI, Sheehy and the insurance captive (CSPA). In connection with the Sheehy Settlement Agreement, Sheehy pledged $0.8 million in cash collateral held in the SEI captive insurance member account, under the CSPA, on or before March 1, 2024, and SEI agreed to continue its collateral pledge until that time.\nCreditor Exchange Agreements\nAs noted in Note 5, Debt, Danny Cuzick, John and Ursula Lampsa and Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. exchanged historical promissory notes issued by EVO and its subsidiaries for (i) warrants to purchase shares of common stock of EVO; (ii) a $75,000 payment and (iii) the Takeback Notes resulting in a restructuring gain of approximately $9.0 million recorded within additional paid-in-capital as of December 31, 2022.\nAmendments to Leases\nIn connection with the Recapitalization Transactions, Ursa Major Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVO (Ursa), entered into two separate lease amendments with Ursa Oak Creek LLC and Ursa Group LLC. The amendments provided that the monthly offset payments under Ursas leases will continue until the earliest of (i) September 8, 2027, (ii) the date that the Takeback Note issued to John and Ursula Lampsa is satisfied in full, and (iii) the date the lease is terminated other than for Ursas breach. See Note 5, Debt, for further information regarding the Takeback Notes.\nPurchase of Fixed Assets\nOn October 15, 2019, EVO entered into an agreement with an existing stockholder to purchase used CNG tractors in exchange for 1,174,800 shares of EVOs common stock and a warrant to purchase 1,174,800 shares of EVOs common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. Although the transaction was not consummated, the Company recorded $3.5 million related to the tractors within property and equipment, net on its consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report, with an associated $3.5 million related to EVOs obligation to issue the common stock and the warrant to purchase common stock within common stock issuable. In October 2023, EVO, the stockholder and his affiliated company entered into a settlement agreement to mutually rescind the transaction.\nFor information regarding additional related party transactions, see Note 5, Debt and Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 4 - Factoring Arrangements\nCertain of EVOs wholly-owned subsidiaries have entered into accounts receivable factoring arrangements with Triumph Business Capital (the Factor) with termination dates that started in September 2021 but automatically renew for successive one-year periods (absent either party's written election to terminate, which has not occurred). Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, each factoring subsidiary, from time to time, sells to the Factor certain of its accounts receivable balances on a recourse basis for credit-approved accounts. The Factor remits 95% of the contracted accounts receivable balance for a given month to the factoring subsidiary (the Advance Amount) with the remaining balance, less fees, to be forwarded once the Factor collects the full accounts receivable balance from the factoring customer.\nOn March 9, 2021, the Company and the Factor entered into a Letter-of-Intent and Memo of Understanding related to the application of certain proceeds received from the USPS in the first quarter of 2021, arising out of the settlement agreements described in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties agreed that the Factor would retain and apply approximately $6.9 million of net proceeds plus funds held in reserve to the outstanding principal amount of the overadvances. The parties further agreed that the Company will repay the remaining overadvances balance of approximately $6.9 million in 48 equal monthly installments beginning January 1, 2022 and that the Factor would apply funds held in reserve against the approximately $0.8 million remaining balance of advances made to the Company during September 2020. Components included in Advances from the factoring arrangements are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\nPurchased accounts receivable\n$\n$\n7,390\nOveradvances\n5,164\n6,885\nTotal\n$\n5,689\n$\n14,275\nThe Factor may require, at its discretion at any time, the Company to repay unearned future contract advances or purchased accounts receivable that have not been paid by the customer. Financing costs are primarily comprised of an interest rate of Prime (subject to a 4% floor) plus 2.0% (resulting in a rate of 9.5% and 6.0% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively). There is also a factor fee of 0.25% of the face amount of the invoice factored and an associated penalty increase for purchased accounts that remain unpaid for 31 days. Total interest and financing fees for factored receivables for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The fees are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 5 - Debt\nAntara Financing Agreement\nOn September 16, 2019, EVO entered into a $24.5 million financing agreement (the Financing Agreement) among EVO, each subsidiary of EVO, various lenders from time to time party thereto and Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. Pursuant to the Financing Agreement, the Company initially borrowed $22.4 million and borrowed the remaining $2.1 million during October 2019 (the Term Loan). All of EVOs subsidiaries were originally guarantors under the Financing Agreement. The Term Loan is secured by all assets of EVO and its subsidiaries, including pledges of all equity in EVOs subsidiaries and is not subject to registration rights. The Financing Agreement contains covenants, subject to specific exceptions, that limit (i) the making of investments, (ii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness, (iii) the incurrence of liens, (iv) payments and asset transfers with restricted junior loan parties or subsidiaries, including dividends, (v) transactions with stockholders and affiliates and (vi) asset dispositions and acquisitions, among others. The Term Loan bears interest at 12% per annum and had an original maturity date of September 16, 2022. Until December 31, 2019, interest on the Term Loan was paid in kind and capitalized as additional principal, and the Company had the option to pay interest on the capitalized interest in cash or in kind. After December 31, 2019, monthly interest payments were due in cash, and all outstanding principal and interest will be due on the maturity date. The Term Loan may be prepaid at any time, subject to payment of a prepayment premium of (1) 7% for each early payment made or coming due on or prior to September 16, 2020, (2) after September 16, 2020, 5% for each early payment made or coming due on or prior to September 16, 2021, and (3) thereafter, no premium shall be due. Proceeds were used (i) to effect the Ritter acquisition, (ii) to refinance and retire existing indebtedness, and (iii) for general working capital needs.\nConcurrently, and in connection with the Financing Agreement, EVO issued two warrants (the $0.01 Warrant and the $2.50 Warrant and collectively, the Antara Warrants) to Antara Capital to purchase an aggregate of 4,375,000 shares of EVO's common stock (the Antara Warrant Shares). The $0.01 Warrant grants Antara Capital the right to purchase up to 3,350,000 Antara Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and is exercisable for five years from the date of issuance. The $2.50 Warrant grants Antara Capital the right to purchase up to 1,025,000 Antara Warrant Shares at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, subject to adjustment for certain distributions, stock splits and issuances of common stock, and is exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance. If the fair market value of the Antara Warrant Shares is greater than the related exercise price at the end of the exercise period (the Antara Warrant Shares are in the money), then any outstanding Antara Warrants that are in the money will be automatically deemed to be exercised immediately prior to the end of the exercise period. Pursuant to the Antara Warrants, EVO granted Antara Capital preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata share, determined based on the number of shares held by Antara Capital or into which Antara Capitals Antara Warrants are exercisable, of capital stock issued by EVO after the issuance date of the Antara Warrants, subject to certain excepted issuances.\nEVO issued a warrant for 1,500,000 shares of EVO's common stock to Antara at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the Side Letter Warrant) subject to the Company's potential acquisition of LoadTrek, a GPS system designed for the trucking industry, owned by a related party. Had the Company successfully completed an acquisition of certain assets of LoadTrek or met financial performance metrics set forth in the warrant agreement, all or a portion of the shares underlying the Side Letter Warrant were subject to cancellation. The Company did not acquire the LoadTrek assets nor did it meet the financial performance metrics and the Side Letter Warrant was subsequently amended to remove the cancellation provision and, therefore, none of the shares underlying the warrant were cancelled.\nSince the Term Loan, Antara Warrants and Side Letter Warrant were negotiated in contemplation of each other and executed within a short period of time, the Company evaluated the debt and warrants as a combined arrangement. Since the Antara Warrants and Side Letter Warrants are liability classified we recorded these items at their fair value and the residual proceeds were allocated to the Term Loan. The non-lender fees incurred to establish the financing arrangement were allocated to the Term Loan and capitalized on the Companys balance sheet as debt issuance costs, which are amortized using the effective interest method into interest expense over the term of the Term Loan.\nThe Term Loan was further evaluated for the existence of embedded features to be bifurcated from the amount allocated to the debt component. The Term Loan agreement contains a mandatory prepayment feature that was determined to be an embedded derivative, requiring bifurcation and fair value recognition for the derivative liability. The fair value of this derivative liability is remeasured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Any changes in the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the derivative liability could result in a material increase or decrease in its carrying value. The allocation of the proceeds to the debt component and the bifurcation of the embedded derivative liability resulted in a $9.0 million debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nForbearance Agreement and Incremental Amendment to Financing Agreement\nDuring February 2020, the Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Incremental Amendment to Financing Agreement (the Incremental Amendment), pursuant to which the Company obtained an additional $3.2 million of term loan commitments (the Incremental Term Loans) and borrowed $3.2 million from Antara Capital on the same terms as its existing term loan commitments provided under the Financing Agreement. The Incremental Term Loans bear interest at 12% per annum, with monthly interest payments due in cash and all outstanding principal and interest due on the maturity date. The Incremental Term Loans may be prepaid at any time, subject to payment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 7% of each prepayment made on or prior to September 16, 2020, and (ii) 5% of each prepayment made after September 16, 2020, but on or prior to September 16, 2021, with no premium due after September 16, 2021. Pursuant to the Incremental Amendment, the collateral agent and other lenders agreed to forbear from exercising certain rights, remedies, powers, privileges, and defenses under the Financing Agreement and the other related loan documents during the forbearance period with respect to certain events of default and/or expected or anticipated events of default arising under the Financing Agreement. The Incremental Amendment also suspended the accrual of interest at the post-default rate until the end of the forbearance period. The Company paid a 2% financing fee in connection with its entry into the Incremental Amendment. The Company also reimbursed the Collateral Agent for $0.1 million of fees, costs, and expenses previously accrued under the Financing Agreement and in addition paid fees, costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent and the lenders newly incurred in connection with the Incremental Amendment.\nIn connection with the Incremental Amendment, EVO issued a warrant (the Antara Warrant 2020) to Antara Capital to purchase 3,650,000 shares (the Antara Warrant Shares 2020) of EVOs common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, subject to adjustment for certain distributions, stock splits and issuances of common stock, as an incentive. The issuance of this warrant results in an additional debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. The Antara Warrant 2020 is exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance. If the fair market value of the Antara Warrant Shares 2020 is greater than $2.50 at the end of the exercise period, then the Antara Warrant 2020 will be deemed to be exercised automatically and immediately prior to the end of the exercise period. Pursuant to the Antara Warrant 2020, EVO granted Antara Capital preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata share, determined based on the number of shares held by Antara Capital or into which warrants held by Antara Capital (including the Antara Warrant 2020) are exercisable, of capital stock issued by EVO after the issuance date of the Antara Warrant 2020, subject to certain excepted issuances.\nThe Company accounted for the Incremental Amendment as a modification of the Financing Agreement. The Company capitalized the estimated fair value of the Antara Warrant 2020 and fees paid to Antara Capital on its balance sheet as a discount on the Incremental Term Loans, which is amortized using the effective interest method into interest expense over the term of the Incremental Term Loans.\nAmendment to Forbearance Agreement and Second Incremental Amendment to Financing Agreement\nDuring March 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to forbearance agreement and second incremental amendment to financing agreement (the Second Incremental Amendment), pursuant to which the Company obtained an additional $3.1 million in term loan commitments (the Second Incremental Term Loans and together with the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loans, the \"EVO Term Loans\") and borrowed $3.1 million from Antara Capital on the same terms as its existing term loan commitments provided under the Financing Agreement. The Second Incremental Term Loans bear interest at 12% per annum, with monthly interest payments due in cash and all outstanding principal and interest due on the maturity date. The Second Incremental Term Loans may be prepaid at any time, subject to payment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 7% of each prepayment made on or prior to September 16, 2020 and (ii) 5% of each prepayment made after September 16, 2020 but on or prior to September 16, 2021, with no premium due after September 16, 2021. The Second Incremental Amendment also suspends the accrual of interest at the post-default rate until the end of the forbearance period. The forbearance period was scheduled to terminate on the earliest of (a) September 30, 2020, (b) the occurrence of any event of default other than the specified defaults, or (c) the date on which any breach of any of the conditions or agreements, including without limitation the affirmative covenants, provided in the Incremental Amendment or Second Incremental Amendment occurs. The Company paid all fees, costs and expenses of the collateral agent and the lenders incurred in connection with the Incremental Amendment and the Second Incremental Amendment.\nThe Company accounted for the Second Incremental Amendment as a modification of the Financing Agreement. The Company capitalized the fees paid to Antara Capital on its balance sheet as a discount on the Second Incremental Term Loans, which is amortized using the effective interest method into interest expense over the term of the Second Incremental Term Loans.\nWaiver and Agreement to Issue Warrant\nEffective March 31, 2020, the Company entered into a Waiver and Agreement to Issue Warrant (the Waiver Agreement) with Antara Capital and the collateral agent, which modified a certain affirmative covenant and waived another affirmative\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncovenant in the Financing Agreement and, in exchange, EVO agreed to issue to Antara Capital a warrant to purchase up to 3,250,000 shares of EVOs common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share as an incentive. The Company accounted for this issuance to Antara Capital as an extinguishment of the existing debt and the execution of a new debt instrument.\nSecond Amendment to Forbearance Agreement and Omnibus Amendment to Loan Agreement\nDuring October 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to forbearance agreement and omnibus amendment to loan documents (the Omnibus Amendment). The Omnibus Amendment (i) extended the forbearance period until December 31, 2020, (ii) added EVO Holding as a borrower under the Financing Agreement, (iii) authorized EVO and/or its subsidiaries to incur unsecured indebtedness of up to $10,000,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and (iv) extended the timelines under which EVO and its subsidiaries are required to comply with certain affirmative covenants set forth in the Financing Agreement, Incremental Amendment, and Second Incremental Amendment.\nThe Omnibus Amendment contained the following additional covenants:\nEVO was required to either (a) fully consummate the acquisition by EVO Equipment Leasing, LLC of 89 used CNG tractors on or before January 3, 2021 or (b) issue 1,174,800 shares of EVOs common stock to the lenders. The Company did not fully consummate the acquisition of the used CNG tractors by January 3, 2021 and became obligated on that date to issue the 1,174,800 shares of EVOs common stock to the lenders.\nEVO was required to issue to each of the lenders ratably warrants authorizing each such lender to, on or after January 1, 2021, purchase its ratable share of up to 500,000 shares of EVO's common stock at the price of $0.01 per share with a 10 year expiration. If EVO or any of its subsidiaries had not repaid or partially repaid the obligations with the net proceeds (in the amount of at least $25.0 million) of a financing under the Main Street Lending Program on or before December 31, 2020, then EVO was required to issue an additional 1,000,000 warrants to the lenders. The Company had not repaid the $25.0 million by December 31, 2020. Therefore, EVO was required to issue warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of EVOs common stock to the lenders.\nAll warrants previously issued to the lenders, at the election of each lender holding same, were exchanged without any cash consideration for warrants to purchase for $0.01 per share of EVO's common stock at the rate of 0.64 warrants per share of EVO's common stock. As a result, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 7,925,000 shares of EVOs common stock at a price of $2.50 per share were exchanged for an aggregate of 5,072,000 shares of EVOs common stock at a price of $0.01 per share.\nThe Company accounted for the Omnibus Amendment as a modification of the Financing Agreement. The Company capitalized the estimated fair value of the warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of EVO's common stock at the price of $0.01 per share, the change in fair value resulting from the warrant exchange, and the fees paid to Antara Capital on its balance sheet as an additional discount on the Financing Agreement, which is amortized using the effective interest method into interest expense over the term of the Financing Agreement. The Company recognized the estimated fair value of the 1,174,800 shares of EVO's common stock as interest expense during the first quarter of 2021.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program loan (the PPP Loan) was forgiven by the Small Business Adminstration (the SBA) in July 2021, which resulted in a $10.1 million gain on extinguishment of debt in July 2021.\nSecond Omnibus Amendment to Loan Documents\nOn December 14, 2020, the Company entered into a second omnibus amendment to loan documents (the Second Omnibus Amendment) to, among other things, authorize EVO Holding, Ritter Transport, Inc., John W. Ritter Trucking, Inc., Johmar Leasing Company, LLC, and Ritter Transportation Systems, Inc., each of which is a subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the Company, to obtain a Main Street Loan in the amount of up to $17.0 million under the Main Street Priority Loan Program authorized by Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Pursuant to the Second Omnibus Amendment, the forbearance period was terminated and the collateral agent and other lenders agreed to waive all existing defaults or events of default under the Financing Agreement that occurred and were continuing as of the date of the Second Omnibus Amendment. The Second Omnibus Amendment also removed or revised certain covenants contained in the Financing Agreement and prior amendments to the Financing Agreement, including the EBITDA-based financial covenant included in the Financing Agreement, and extended the maturity date of the term loans under the Financing Agreement to the earlier of (1) March 15, 2026 or (2) the date that is ninety-one days after the date of payment in full in cash of all obligations in respect of the Main Street Loan. Under the Second Omnibus Amendment, interest on the term loans under the Financing Agreement is payable in kind at the rate of 14.5% per annum for the first eight full or partial calendar quarters following the effective date of the Second Omnibus Amendment and is payable in cash, subject to satisfaction of certain unrestricted cash availability requirements, at the rate of 12.0% per\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nannum commencing with the ninth calendar quarter following the effective date. As a result of the Main Street Loan, the Second Omnibus Amendment, and related agreements, payment of the principal balance of the EVO Term Loans is subject and subordinate to the prior payment in full of all obligations under the Main Street Loan. The Company accounted for the Second Omnibus Amendment as a modification of the Financing Agreement. As of the date of this filing, interest is still being paid in kind at 14.5%.\nMain Street Priority Loan Program Facility with Commerce Bank of Arizona, Inc.\nOn December 29, 2020, EVO Holding, Ritter Transport, Inc., John W. Ritter Trucking, Inc., Johmar Leasing Company, LLC, and Ritter Transportation Systems, Inc. (collectively, the Borrowers), each of which is a subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the Company, entered into a Loan Agreement dated December 14, 2020 (the Loan Agreement) and related documents (together with the Loan Agreement, the Loan Documents) for a loan in the amount of up to $17.0 million (the Main Street Loan) serviced by Commerce Bank of Arizona, Inc. (the Bank) as lender under the Main Street Priority Loan Program authorized by Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Borrowers and the Bank subsequently entered into a Modification Agreement to the Loan Agreement dated December 22, 2020 (the Modification Agreement) and a Second Modification Agreement to the Loan Agreement dated December 23, 2020 (the Second Modification Agreement). During the first quarter of 2021, the Borrowers used all of the net proceeds of the Main Street Loan to refinance a portion of the amount outstanding under the Financing Agreement discussed above under the caption Forbearance Agreement and Incremental Amendment to Financing Agreement and to pay related prepayment premiums.\nThe Main Street Loan has a five-year term and bears interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) 3% percent per year plus (ii) the rates per year quoted by Bank as Banks three-month LIBOR rate based upon quotes of the London Interbank Offered Rate, as quoted for U.S. Dollars by Bloomberg, or other comparable services selected by the Bank (the LIBOR Index). Such interest rate will change once every third month on the fifth day of the month and will be the LIBOR Index on the day which is two banking days prior to the date the change becomes effective.\nAccrued but unpaid interest on the Main Street Loan for loan year one (i.e., the period of December 14, 2020 to December 14, 2021) will be added to the principal amount of the Main Street Loan on December 14, 2021. Following the end of loan year one, interest on the Main Street Loan will be payable quarterly on the 14th day of the last month of each calendar quarter (i.e., March 14, June 14, September 14 and December 14 of each year), with the first interest payment due on March 14, 2022. In addition, on December 14, 2023 and December 14, 2024, the Borrowers must make an annual payment of principal plus accrued but unpaid interest with the principal in an amount equal to 15% of the Main Street Loan amount plus capitalized interest. The entire outstanding principal balance of the Main Street Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable in full on December 14, 2025. The Borrowers may prepay the Main Street Loan at any time without incurring any prepayment penalties.\nThe Loan Documents contain customary events of default, including, among others, those relating to a failure to make payment, bankruptcy, cross default under other credit facilities, breaches of representations and covenants, and the occurrence of certain events. The Loan Documents also contain customary remedies for a facility of this type, exercisable following the occurrence of an event of default, including, among others, the rights to terminate the Banks commitment under Loan Agreement, accelerate the maturity date, foreclose the liens and security interests securing the Main Street Loan, and all other rights and remedies available under the Loan Documents and applicable law. As security for the Main Street Loan, the Borrowers granted the Bank a security interest in and to substantially all of their respective properties, and the Company guaranteed the payment and performance of the Borrowers obligations under the Loan Documents.\nIn connection with the Main Street Loan, EVO contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding equity of Environmental Alternative Fuels, LLC (EAF) to EVO Holding with the consent of Danny Cuzick as the holder of certain previously disclosed promissory notes that are secured in part by the assets of EAF. In consideration of Danny Cuzicks consent to the contribution, the Company agreed to (a) indemnify Danny Cuzick for up to $0.5 million in connection with Danny Cuzicks guaranty of certain obligations of EVO and its subsidiaries to Mercedes-Benz Financial Services USA LLC and (b) issue to Danny Cuzick a warrant (the Cuzick Warrant) to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of EVO's common stock at the cost of $0.01 per share. Danny Cuzick is a former member of EVOs Board. The Company capitalized the estimated fair value of the Cuzick Warrant on its balance sheet as a discount on the Main Street Loan, which is amortized using the effective interest method into interest expense over the term of the Main Street Loan.\nBridge Loan and Executive Loans\nOn March 11, 2022, EVO and certain subsidiary guarantors of the Company entered into the Bridge Loan Agreement with Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $9 million from Antara Capital and had the ability to borrow up to an additional $3 million from Antara Capital prior to May 31, 2022, and also borrowed $0.8 million from the Executive Lenders. $0.2 million of the amount the Company borrowed from the Executive Lenders was borrowed in exchange for Batuta's surrender of a Secured Convertible Note in the principal amount of $0.2 million dated August 8, 2018 that Batuta previously purchased from Dane Capital Fund LP. The Bridge Loan bears interest at 14% per annum and had an original maturity date of the earlier of (i) demand by Antara Capital at any time prior to the date on which a collateral agent designated by Antara Capital has been granted a valid and enforceable, perfected, first priority lien on the collateral described in the Bridge Loan Agreement, subject only to permitted liens, on terms reasonably acceptable to Antara Capital, and (ii) May 31, 2022. The Executive Loans bear interest at 14% per annum and had an original maturity date of June 3, 2022 (although all payments in respect of the Executive Loans are subordinated in right and time of payment to all payments in respect of the Bridge Loan). Interest on the Bridge Loan and Executive Loans will accrue until the principal balances are repaid. No principal and interest payments are due until maturity. Refer to Note 13, Subsequent Events, for discussion regarding the subsequent assignment of certain amounts owed to Antara Capital.\nIn the event of a default, the lenders have the right to terminate their obligations under the Bridge Loan Agreement and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans. As defined in the Bridge Loan Agreement, events of default include, but are not limited to: failure by the Company to pay any amount due under the Bridge Loan Agreement when due; default by EVO or any of its subsidiaries for failure to pay amounts due and payable under any indebtedness in an amount in excess of $0.1 million if the effect of such default is to accelerate the maturity of any such indebtedness; and any representation or warranty made in connection with the Bridge Loan Agreement being materially false.\nIn connection with the Bridge Loan Agreement, and as a condition to the Company drawing the Bridge Loan pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement, on March 11, 2022, EVO granted Antara Capital 11,969,667 warrants to purchase EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share and granted the Executive Lenders an aggregate of 1,097,219 warrants to purchase EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (collectively, the \"Bridge Loan Warrants\"), subject to certain adjustments. Each Bridge Loan Warrant may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, pursuant to the terms of such warrants, for a period of five years from the date of issuance. The estimated fair value of the liability-classified Bridge Loan Warrants upon issuance was $12.8 million and a) the Company capitalized $9.6 million on its balance sheet as a discount on the Bridge Loan and Executive Loans, which is amortized into interest expense over the term of the Bridge Loan and Executive Loans; b) the Company immediately recorded $2.9 million as interest expense, which represents the estimated fair value of the Bridge Loan Warrants in excess of the principal due on the Bridge Loan and Executive Loans; and c) the Company recorded a $0.2 million loss on extinguishment of the Batuta Secured Convertible Note.\nAmendments to Bridge Loan and Executive Loans\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Second Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from June 30, 2022 to July 8, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 7, 2022 to July 15, 2022.\nOn July 8, 2022, the Company, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Third Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from July 8, 2022 to July 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 15, 2022 to July 22, 2022. In addition, the Third Extension Agreement stipulated that on or before July 13, 2022, the Board of Directors of EVO shall have duly approved and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designation to evidence the issuance of a new series of Series D Non-Participating Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value, that will, upon issuance, entitle Antara Capital (in its capacity as sole holder of the Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock) to vote such number of votes per share that will allow Antara Capital to exercise 51% of the voting capital stock of EVO.\nOn July 13, 2022, pursuant to the Third Extension Agreement, EVO filed the Series D Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which authorized EVO to issue up to one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock.\nUnder the Series D Certificate of Designations, prior to a Bridge Loan Triggering Event and on and following the Bridge Loan Discharge Date, the holders of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of EVO's common stock as a single class on any Series D Shareholder Matter, and the holders of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast a number of votes on any Series D Shareholder Matter equal to the total number of votes of all non-holders of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock entitled to vote on any such Series D Shareholder Matter plus 10. From the occurrence of a Bridge Loan Triggering Event to (but excluding) the Bridge Loan Discharge Date, the holders of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock (in their capacity as such) will have no voting rights except as otherwise required by law. In addition, the Series D Certificate of Designations provides that governance mechanisms that could have the effect of limiting,\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nreducing or adversely affecting the Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock holders voting rights under the Series D Certificate of Designations will require the consent of the Series D Majority. The Series D Majority may elect to waive or decline to exercise any or all voting rights granted under the Series D Certificate of Designations, in whole or in part, on either a revocable or irrevocable basis.\nThe issuance of one share of Series D Non-Participating Preferred to Antara Capital on July 13, 2022, resulted in a change of control of the Company, with Antara Capital having voting control on Series D Shareholder Matters. The consideration for the issuance of Series D Non-Participating Preferred Stock to Antara Capital was Antara Capital's agreement to enter into the Third Extension Agreement, and the Company did not receive any cash consideration.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Fourth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from July 15, 2022 to August 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from July 22, 2022 to August 22, 2022.\nOn August 12, 2022, the Company, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders entered into a Fifth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from August 15, 2022 to September 15, 2022 and the Executive Loans maturity date from August 22, 2022 to September 22, 2022.\nOn September 8, 2022, the Company, Antara Capital and the Executive Lenders, in contemplation of the SPA discussed below, entered into a Sixth Extension Agreement that extended the Bridge Loan maturity date from September 15, 2022 to December 29, 2023 and the Executive Loans maturity date from September 22, 2022 to January 5, 2024.\nAmended and Restated Bridge Loan\nOn December 23, 2022, Antara Capital, CEOF, and Hudson Park entered into a Master Assignment and Assumption agreement pursuant to which Antara Capital sold and assigned its rights and obligations in a portion of the Bridge Loan and warrants with an exercise price per share of $0.01 and $0.0001 to CEOF and Hudson Park. On the same date, Antara Capital, the Executive Lenders, CEOF and Hudson Park amended and restated the Bridge Loan to reflect the assigned portions of the Bridge Loan to CEOF and Hudson Park. No changes were made to the Bridge Loan in connection with the assignment to CEOF and Hudson Park and no payments were made to the holders of the debt. This event is a transaction among debt holders.\nAmendments to and Conversion of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes\nOn March 11, 2022, EVO entered into amendments (the \"Convertible Note Amendments\") to certain secured convertible promissory notes (the \"Convertible Notes\") dated February 1, 2017 with Danny Cuzick, individually and as holders representative on behalf of each of Damon Cuzick, Thomas Kiley and Theril Lund. The Convertible Note Amendments permitted the holder of each note and Danny Cuzick in his capacity as holders representative to convert the full amount of outstanding principal and accrued interest, without limitation related to trading volume of EVO's common stock, into either shares of EVO's common stock or warrants to purchase shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. On March 11, 2022, Danny Cuzick, individually and as holders representative on behalf of each of Damon Cuzick, Thomas Kiley and Theril Lund, exercised the right to convert the Convertible Notes into warrants to purchase shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. As a result, EVO granted Messrs, Cuzick, Cuzick, Kiley and Lund an aggregate of 7,533,750 warrants to purchase EVO's common stock at $0.01 per share (collectively, the \"Convertible Note Warrants\"). Each Convertible Note Warrant may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, pursuant to the terms of such warrants, for a period of five years from the date of issuance.\nThe Company accounted for the Convertible Note Amendments as an extinguishment of the existing debt and the execution of a new debt instrument. As a result, the Company recorded a $5.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which represents the $9.0 million estimated fair value of the amended Convertible Notes in excess of the $3.8 million carrying value of the original Convertible Notes. The Company accounted for the issuance of the Convertible Note Warrants as an extinguishment of the new debt instrument. As a result, the Company recorded the $9.0 million carrying value of the amended Convertible Notes and the $0.7 million of accrued interest as an increase in additional paid-in capital.\nCreditor Exchange Agreements\nIn connection with the Recapitalization Transactions, EVO and certain of its subsidiaries, EAF and EVO Equipment Leasing, LLC (collectively, the EVO Parties), entered into Exchange Agreements with each of Danny Cuzick, John and Ursula Lampsa, Billy (Trey) Peck Jr., Mohsin Meghji, and Robert Mendola (collectively, the Exchanging Creditors). The Exchange Agreements permitted the Exchanging Creditors to exchange existing promissory notes issued by EVO and its subsidiaries for the issuance and delivery of (i) warrants to purchase shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share that will be exercisable following the adoption of the Charter Amendment, (ii) warrants to purchase shares of EVO's common\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nstock at an exercise price of $0.53 per share that will be exercisable following the adoption of the Charter Amendment, (iii) new promissory notes and (iv) to certain Exchanging Creditors, a specified cash payment. Refer to Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants, for discussion regarding the Charter Amendment.\nPursuant to the Exchange Agreements, the Exchanging Creditors exchanged promissory notes issued by EVO and its subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of principal and accrued interest of approximately $18.3 million for (i) warrants to purchase 47,549,779 shares of EVO's common stock at $0.0001 per share, (ii) warrants to purchase 23,774,891 shares of EVO's common stock at $0.53 per share (collectively, the Exchanging Creditors Warrants), and (iii) new promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.7 million (the Takeback Notes) and (iv) a cash payment of $0.1 million to certain Exchanging Creditors.\nEach warrant issued to the Exchanging Creditors at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, pursuant to the terms of such warrants, for a period of thirty days following October 24, 2022, the date EVOs Board adopted the Charter Amendment. Each warrant issued to the Exchanging Creditors at an exercise price of $0.53 per share may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, pursuant to the terms of such warrants, for a period of five years from the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $2.9 million.\nThe Takeback Notes bear interest at 3% per annum, are unsecured, and have a maturity date of September 8, 2027. Interest on the Takeback Notes is payable in cash or in kind, at EVOs option, the first day of each January, April, July and October. If any amount of the Takeback Notes is not paid when due, then all amounts outstanding shall accrue interest at 4% per annum (\"default date\") and shall be payable on demand. EVO may, at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty, prepay all or any portion of the outstanding principal, including accrued and unpaid interest, on the Takeback Notes (\"optional prepayment\").\nIn the event of a default, the Exchanging Creditors have the right to terminate their obligations under the Takeback Notes and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans (\"mandatory prepayment\"). As defined in the Takeback Notes, events of default include, but are not limited to: failure by EVO to pay any amount due under the Takeback Notes when due; a voluntary or involuntary case or other proceeding commenced by or against EVO seeking liquidation, reorganization or bankruptcy.\nThe Company concluded that the default interest rate, optional prepayment and mandatory prepayment features do not require bifurcation based on the derivative accounting scope exception in ASC 815 for certain contracts involving an entitys own equity.\nThe Creditor Exchange Amendments constitutes as a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructuring, because the Company is experiencing financial difficulty and a concession has been granted by each Exchanging Creditor. As the TDR involves a partial settlement of debt through transfer of assets and grant of an equity interest, the carrying amount of the original debt is reduced by the cash paid and the fair value of the equity interests. When the reduced net carrying value of the debt exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying amount is reduced to the amount of future undiscounted cash flows, including amounts contingently payable. A restructuring gain is recognized and is reduced by any third-party restructuring costs. Future cash payments will be recorded as reductions in the carrying amount of the debt. No further interest expense will be recognized, unless required in connection with contingent payments.\nThe Company recorded a total restructuring gain of approximately $9.2 million. The Company calculated the restructuring gain by comparing the carrying value of the debt, $18.2 million, reduced by $0.2 million paid in cash and $3.1 million of equity instruments issued to the Exchanging Creditors, with the undiscounted future cash flows of the Takeback Notes. When determining the undiscounted future cash flows of the Takeback Notes, the Company assumed that all interest through the life of the Takeback Notes will be paid in kind, included contingent payments of $0.8 million, and other sweeteners paid to the Exchanging Creditors. The Company reduced the restructuring gain by $0.4 million for legal fees related to the TDR.\nAs three of the Exchanging Creditors are considered Related Parties, we recorded the restructuring gain associated with these parties as a capital contribution resulting in $9.0 million of the restructuring gain recorded within additional paid-in-capital as of December 31, 2022. The remaining $0.2 million was recorded as a restructuring gain in other miscellaneous income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The per share effect of the restructuring gain on both basic and diluted earnings per common share was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 3, Related Party Transactions, regarding the Exchanging Creditors that are related parties.\nAmendment to Loan Agreement (Clean Energy)\nOn September 2, 2022, EVO, Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVO (Thunder Ridge), Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. and Clean Energy entered into a First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Clean Energy Amendment) that amended the Loan and Security Agreement between Thunder Ridge and Clean Energy dated August 31,\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2017. The Clean Energy Amendment extended the maturity date of the loan from Clean Energy to Thunder Ridge from July 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Clean Energy Amendment, Thunder Ridge agreed to pay Clean Energy (i) $0.2 million on or before September 30, 2022, (ii) six payments of $0.1 million on or before each of September 30, 2022, October 31, 2022, November 30, 2022, December 31, 2022, January 31, 2023 and February 28, 2023, (iii) $0.3 million on or before December 31, 2022, and (iv) $0.4 million on or before March 31, 2023.\nThe amendment with Clean Energy was accounted for as a TDR because the Company is experiencing financial difficulty and the new payment structure results in the effective borrowing rate decreasing after the restructuring, which was determined to be a concession granted by Clean Energy. Since the future undiscounted cash flows of the restructured notes payable exceed the net carrying value of the original note payable due to the maturity date extension, the modification was accounted for prospectively with no gain or loss recorded in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDebt (with unrelated parties) consists of:\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\n(a) Main Street Loan\n$\n17,441\n(1)\n$\n17,552\n(2)\n(b) $1.3 million note payable\n(c) $4.0 million Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (Secured Convertible Notes)\n-\n(d) $0.3 million note payable\n-\n(e) Thunder Ridge supplier advance\n(f) Various notes payable acquired from J.B.

Beginning March 14, 2022, the Borrowers must make quarterly interest payments, and the Borrowers must make principal payments equal to 15% of the face amount of the Main Street Loan plus capitalized interest on each of December 14, 2023 and December 14, 2024. The entire outstanding principal balance, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable in full on December 14, 2025.\nThe Company classified the $17.6 million unpaid principal balance, which includes $0.6 million of capitalized interest, as a current liability as of December 31, 2022 due to the existence of one or more covenant violations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the unamortized debt discount was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and the unamortized debt issuance costs were $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\n(b)$1.3 million note payable\nThe $1.3 million note payable was issued December 31, 2014, with interest adjusted to the SBA LIBOR base rate, plus 2.35%. The note matures March 2024, is secured by substantially all of Titans business assets and is personally guaranteed by certain former members of Titan including a former member of our board of directors and certain of his relatives, and other beneficial owners. The note is a co-borrower arrangement between Titan and El Toro with the proceeds received by El Toro. Refer to Note 13, Subsequent Events, for discussion regarding the loan dispute settlement.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(c)$4.0 million Secured Convertible Promissory Notes\nThe Secured Convertible Notes were issued during August 2018. The Company paid debt issuance costs of $0.5 million in connection with the Secured Convertible Notes. They bear interest at 9%, compounded quarterly, with principal due two years after issuance and are secured by all the assets of the Company. The holder may agree, at its discretion, to add accrued interest in lieu of payment to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes are convertible into shares (the Note Shares) of EVOs common stock at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share of common stock at the holders option: 1) at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance or 2) at any time within 90 days after a triggering event, including a sale, reorganization, merger, or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving entity. The Secured Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance if the average volume of shares of common stock traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, NYSE American Market or a higher tier of either exchange is 100,000 or more for the 10 trading days prior to the applicable date. Such a mandatory conversion has not occurred.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes also provide that the Company will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as promptly as reasonably practical following the issuance date of the Secured Convertible Notes, but in no event later than 45 days following the issuance date, a registration statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement) covering the resale of the common stock and the warrant shares and as soon as reasonably practical thereafter to effect such registration. The Company is required to pay liquidated damages of 1% of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Convertible Notes each 30 days if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 180 days of the filing date of the Registration Statement. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and paid $0 and $0, respectively, in liquidated damages to noteholders.\nAs additional consideration for the Secured Convertible Notes, EVO issued warrants to the holders to purchase 1,602,000 shares of EVO's common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants issued determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $0.7 million, calculated with a ten-year term; 65% volatility; 2.89%, 2.85% or 3.00% discount rates and the assumption of no dividends.\nIn March and April 2021, the Company entered into certain Note Purchase Agreements and Releases (the Note Purchase Agreements) between the Company and certain holders (the Holders) of the Secured Convertible Notes in the principal amount of $0.6 million. The Note Purchase Agreements provide for various releases by the Holders and their respective representatives, successors, and assigns, including releases arising out of or related to the Secured Convertible Notes and the Secured Convertible Note Agreements. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreements, the Company agreed to purchase the Secured Convertible Notes and the Secured Convertible Note Agreements from the Holders in exchange for approximately $0.1 million in cash to the Holders and to issue to the Holders warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 231,453 shares of EVO's common stock at a price of $0.01 per share. The Company recognized the estimated fair value of the warrants as a $0.2 million increase in additional paid-in capital and recognized a $0.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest of less than $0.1 million was added to the principal balance.\nPursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement in March 2022, the Company borrowed $9 million from Antara Capital and also borrowed $0.8 million from the Executive Lenders. $0.2 million of the amount the Company borrowed from the Executive Lenders was borrowed in exchange for Batuta's surrender of a Secured Convertible Note in the principal amount of $0.2 million dated August 8, 2018, which the Company accounted for as the extinguishment of the $0.2 million Secured Convertible Note.\nPursuant to the Exchange Creditor Agreement, the remaining Secured Convertible Notes in the aggregate amount of principal and accrued interest of approximately $0.4 million were exchanged for warrants and new promissory notes with a principal amount of approximately $0.1 million.

The advance bears interest at 8.5%, is collateralized by substantially all of Thunder Ridges assets, is guaranteed by a member of management, and has a July 2022 maturity date. On September 2, 2022, the agreement was extended to March 2023.\n(f)Various notes payable acquired from JB Lease\nThe various notes payable acquired from JB Lease were issued to multiple lenders with interest rates ranging from 3.9% to 5.1% per annum. The notes have maturity dates ranging from September 2019 to August 2024. These notes are collateralized by transportation equipment and guaranteed by certain stockholders of the Company.\n(g)$0.8 million note payable\nThe $0.8 million note payable to a First Fidelity Bank was issued February 11, 2019, with interest at 10.2% per annum and a maturity date of February 11, 2023. The note is collateralized by certain equipment and guaranteed by a former member of management. During December 2021, a $0.4 million note payable was issued to the same financing company that is collateralized by the same equipment.

The note is collateralized by certain equipment and guaranteed by a former member of management.\n(i)Failed sale-leaseback obligations\nCertain notes payable acquired from Sheehy were payable to a bank with interest rates of 4.35% to 4.375% per annum and were scheduled to mature between September 2020 and December 2021. During September 2020, the Company sold certain assets that are collateral for the notes payable to Equipment Leasing Services, LLC (\"ELS\") for aggregate proceeds of $0.7 million, used such proceeds to extinguish the notes payable, and entered into a lease agreement with ELS under which the Company agreed to lease back the assets. In addition, during 2021 the Company entered into five sale-leaseback arrangements to provide approximately $5.2 million in cash proceeds for previously purchased equipment. Because these leasebacks are classified as finance leases, the Company determined that it did not relinquish control of the assets to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company accounted for the transactions as failed sale-leasebacks whereby the Company continues to depreciate the assets and recorded financing obligations for the consideration received from the buyer-lessor. No gain or loss was recognized on these transactions.\n(j)Notes payable to three financing companies\nThe Company issued notes payable to three financing companies in February and October 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2021 with maturity dates in March 2023, October 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2025, respectively.

Interest on the Takeback Notes is payable in cash or in kind, at the Companys option, the first day of each January, April, July and October. In connection with the Exchange Creditor Agreements, the exchange constituted as a TDR, and future cash payments will be recorded as reductions in the carrying amount of the debt.

The maturity date is the earlier of (1) March 15, 2026 or (2) the date that is ninety-one days after the date of payment in full in cash of all obligations in respect of the Main Street Loan. Beginning with the Omnibus Amendment and ending on December 14, 2020, interest was paid in kind at a rate of 17% per annum.

Stock options have a maximum term of ten years, and it is the Companys practice to grant options to employees with exercise prices equal to or greater than the estimated fair market value of its common stock.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant. Stock option values are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. The expected option terms are calculated based on the simplified method for plain vanilla options due to our limited exercise information. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the options. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the selected comparable companies. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The valuation model assumes no dividends. There is no estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs described in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, some of EVOs stock options contain a provision that provides for the acceleration of vesting upon the Company completing an aggregate of at least $30 million of any combination of debt and/or equity financing transactions after the date of grant. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the number of stock options for which vesting accelerated as a result of this provision were 0 and 0, respectively.\nFrom February 2020 through December 2020, EVO's Board approved the grant of 3,394,999 stock options with an exercise price of $2.50 per share and a 10-year life. For 1,450,000 of the stock options granted, one-quarter (1/4) vested and became exercisable on the grant date, with the remainder vesting and becoming exercisable ratably on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The remaining 1,944,999 stock options granted were fully vested and exercisable on the grant date. During February 2020, EVO's Board also granted 70,000 stock options as compensation to board members with an exercise price of $2.50 per share and a 10-year life. The options vest ratably over three years. One-quarter (1/4) of the options\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nvested and became exercisable on the grant date. The remaining vest and become exercisable ratably on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, EVO reduced the exercise price of certain stock options previously granted to certain named executive officers of the Company and other key employees from an original exercise price of $2.50 per share to an exercise price of $1.50 per share, which the board of directors determined was equal to or greater than the fair market value of EVOs common stock. A total of 4,394,999 options were subject to the exercise price reduction. The repricing was accounted for as a stock option modification whereby the incremental fair value of each option was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the date of the modification, and $0.2 million was recognized related to vested options as incremental compensation expense during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The Company will recognize the remaining $0.1 million of incremental compensation expense resulting from the modification on a straight-line basis over the remaining requisite service periods.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, EVO's Board approved the grant to an employee of 750,000 stock options with an exercise price of $1.50 per share and a 10-year life. One-third (1/3) of the options vested and became exercisable on the grant date, one-third (1/3) vest and become exercisable approximately 11 months after the date of grant, and one-third (1/3) vest and become exercisable approximately 23 months after the date of grant. During the third quarter of 2021, EVO's Board also granted 211,000 stock options as compensation to board members with an exercise price of $1.50 and a 10-year life. 111,000 of the options vested and became exercisable on the grant date. The remaining 100,000 stock options vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant. During the fourth quarter of 2021, EVO's Board approved the grant to an employee of 500,000 stock options with an exercise price of $1.50 per share and a 10-year life. One-quarter (1/4) of the options vested and became exercisable on the grant date. The remaining 375,000 stock option vest and become exercisable ratably on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to stock options. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $0.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested portions of outstanding stock options.\nThe following table presents the stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nNumber of Shares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual Term\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding - December 31, 2021\n10,920,249\n$\n1.96\n7.6\n$\n-\nGranted\n80,000\n1.50\nExercised\n-\n-\n-\nExpired\n(1,372,307\n)\n1.50\n-\nOutstanding - December 31, 2022\n9,627,942\n$\n2.03\n6.7\n$\n-\nExercisable - December 31, 2022\n9,928,211\n$\n2.01\n6.4\n$\n-\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31:\nApproximate risk-free rate\n2.8% - 2.9%\n0.7% - 1.3%\nExpected life (in years)\n5.75 - 5.75\n5.0 - 5.75\nDividend yield\n%\n%\nVolatility\n47.9% - 48.0%\n47.1% - 47.5%\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted was $0.13 and $0.15 per share during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.1 million.\nWarrants - Stock-Based Compensation\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, EVO issued to an employee warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of EVOs common stock. The warrants were issued with a 10-year life and an exercise price equal to the lesser of $2.50 per share and the price at which stock options were to be granted to the Company's officers in 2021. One-third (1/3) of the warrants vested and became\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nexercisable on the grant date, one-third (1/3) vested and became exercisable on March 31, 2021, and one-third (1/3) vested and became exercisable on June 30, 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, the exercise price of the warrants was set at $1.50 per share pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement. Except for the reduction in exercise price, all terms and conditions of the warrants remain the same. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million related to these warrants.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, in connection with the Recapitalization Transaction, EVO issued warrants to purchase 5,983,825 shares of EVO's common stock to compensate certain key members of management. The warrants were issued with a 5-year life and an exercise price of $0.63 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of less than $0.1 million related to these warrants.\nThe following table presents information related to stock-based compensation warrants outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nNumber of Shares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual Term\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding - December 31, 2021\n1,911,099\n$\n3.42\n5.9\n$\n-\nOutstanding - December 31, 2022\n7,894,924\n$\n1.30\n4.7\n$\n-\nExercisable - December 31, 2022\n7,894,924\n$\n1.30\n4.7\n$\n-\nNote 8 - Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at fair value. The carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and are Level 1 assets or liabilities of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).\nLevel 3 - Inputs are unobservable and reflect the Companys assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe Companys derivative liability embedded in the Financing Agreement related to the mandatory prepayment feature is measured at fair value using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and is classified as a Level 3 liability of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. The liability is presented as an embedded derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheets and is subject to remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense) in its consolidated statements of operations. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include: (1) management's estimates of the probability and timing of future cash flows and related events; (2) the Company's risk-adjusted discount rate that includes a company-specific risk premium; and (3) the Company's cost of debt.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Company's liability-classified warrants issued with an exercise price of $0.01 per share are measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are classified as a Level 3 liability of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. The warrant liabilities are presented as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense) in its consolidated statements of operations. The inputs and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: (1) EVO's stock price; (2) the exercise price of the warrant; (3) the expected term of the warrant; (4) EVO's expected stock price volatility; (5) EVO's expected dividends; and (6) the risk-free interest rate.\nThe Company's liability-classified warrants issued with an exercise price of greater than $0.01 per share are measured at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model and are classified as a Level 3 liability of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. The warrant liabilities are presented as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value recognized as a component of other income (expense) or as compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The inputs and assumptions used in the Monte Carlo model include: (1) EVO's stock price; (2) EVO's expected stock price volatility; and (3) the risk-free interest rate. The Company reclassified to equity all of its liability classified warrants with exercise prices greater than $0.01 on September 8, 2022. The warrants were amended to modify certain anti-dilution features and they became indexed to EVOs common stock.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation for the opening and closing balances of both liabilities from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2022:\n($ in thousands)\nDerivative Liability\nWarrant Liabilities\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n$\n2,278\n$\n11,264\nIssuances\n-\n-\nNet change in fair value\n(765\n)\n2,520\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n1,513\n13,784\nIssuances\n-\n33,340\nExercises\n-\n(20,460\n)\nNet change in fair value\n(25,207\n)\nReclassification of warrants from liability classified to equity classified\n-\n(1,258\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n1,552\n$\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 during the periods presented.\nThe Companys obligations under its debt agreements are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of the Companys obligations under its convertible notes and the EVO Term Loans are considered Level 3 liabilities of the fair value hierarchy because fair value was estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of the Companys other debt arrangements are considered Level 2 liabilities of the fair value hierarchy because fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the liability such as interest rates and yield curves. The estimated fair value of the EVO Term Loans was $11.7 million as of December 31, 2022, and its carrying value was $20.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of the EVO Term Loans was $9.7 million as of December 31, 2021, and its carrying value was $17.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The carrying value of the Companys remaining debt obligations approximates fair value and was $40.0 million and $49.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nCertain non-financial assets, primarily property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is adjusted to fair value, using market-based assumptions.\nNote 9 - Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has various obligations under operating and finance lease arrangements related primarily to the rental of trucks and trailers, maintenance and support facilities, office space, and parking yards. Many of these leases include one or more options, at the Companys discretion, to renew and extend the agreement beyond the current lease expiration date. These options are included in the calculation of the Companys lease liability when it becomes reasonably certain the option will be exercised. The Companys lease agreements typically do not\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ninclude options to purchase the leased property, nor do they contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company elected the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases, as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, and are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments; however, the implicit rate in the lease is not readily determinable for all the leases. In such cases, the Company uses an estimate of the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease within operating supplies and expenses, equipment rent expense, and general and administrative expense. Finance lease costs consist of amortization expense and interest expense. Finance lease right-of-use assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life or the lease term to amortization expense, and the carrying amount of the lease liability is adjusted to reflect interest expense. Variable lease payments that are not based on an index or that result from changes to an index subsequent to the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability are not included in the measurement of lease ROU assets or liabilities and instead are recognized in equipment rent in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had the following balances recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to its lease arrangements:\n($ in thousands)\nClassification\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nAssets\nOperating leases\nRight-of-use-asset\n$\n7,527\n$\n7,155\nFinance leases\nRight-of-use-asset\n31,086\n24,391\nLiabilities\nCurrent:\nOperating leases\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion\n2,201\n3,045\nFinance leases\nFinance lease liabilities, current portion\n9,009\n4,448\nNon-current:\nOperating leases\nOperating lease liabilities, less current portion\n5,420\n4,114\nFinance leases\nFinance lease liabilities, less current portion\n22,232\n21,790\nComponents of lease cost are as follows:\n($ in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of ROU assets\n$\n7,620\n$\n6,138\nInterest on lease assets\n2,974\n2,798\nOperating lease costs\n4,240\n4,434\nShort-term lease costs\n9,386\n7,871\nVariable lease costs\nTotal\n$\n24,784\n$\n21,723\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our leases are as follows:\n($ in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nSupplemental cash flow information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n$\n8,801\n$\n5,895\nOperating cash flows from finance lease interest expense\n2,974\n2,798\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n4,128\n4,503\nNon-cash activity\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nFinance leases\n12,463\n2,890\nOperating leases\n3,556\n1,807\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our leases are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nFinance leases\n4.6\n3.8\nOperating leases\n4.0\n3.5\nWeighted-average discount rate\nFinance leases\n%\n%\nOperating leases\n%\n%\nMaturities of lease liabilities by fiscal year for our leases are as follows:\n($ in thousands)\nOperating\nLeases\nFinance\nLeases\n$\n2,902\n$\n11,694\n2,465\n10,428\n1,546\n10,217\n1,213\n3,849\nThereafter\nTotal lease payments\n$\n9,258\n$\n37,086\nLess: Imputed interest\n(1,637\n)\n(5,845\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n7,621\n$\n31,241\nRelated Party Leases\nThe Company has various lease obligations with related parties for trucks, office space and terminals expiring at various dates through January 2029.

The Company maintains insurance to cover certain actions and it establishes reserves for specific legal proceedings when the Company determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no estimate of possible losses can be made.\nSee Note 13, Subsequent Events, for descriptions of the settlement of the legal proceeding relating to Falcon Capital, LLC and Scott Honour and the settlement of the legal proceeding relating to Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\nExcept as described above and with respect to claims covered by insurance, there are no other currently pending material legal or governmental proceedings and, as far as we are aware, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party or to which any of our properties is subject.\nPPP Loan\nOn May 8, 2020, we received a letter from the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis of the U.S. House of Representatives demanding that we return the $10.0 million PPP Loan that we applied for and received under the CARES Act in April 2020. We elected not to return the PPP Loan proceeds as requested and our PPP Loan was subsequently forgiven in July 2021. Also, the United States Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") has stated that it intends to audit the PPP Loan application of any company, like us, that received PPP Loan proceeds of more than $2 million. However, we are not currently party to or aware of any contemplated proceeding with the Select Subcommittee, the SBA, or any other governmental authority with respect to the PPP Loan.\nLong-Term Take-or-Pay Natural Gas Supply Contracts\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had commitments to purchase natural gas on a take-or-pay basis with three vendors. It is anticipated these are normal purchases that will be necessary for sales, and that any penalties for failing to meet minimum volume requirements will be immaterial. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated remaining liability under the take-or-pay arrangements was approximately $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements - Captive Insurance\nPrior to the acquisition, Sheehy was insured for certain insurance risks with a captive insurance company under SEI. Upon the acquisition of Sheehy from SEI in January 2019, the Company became a member of the captive and Sheehy was transferred to the EVO member account. As a member of the captive, the Company is required to maintain a collateral deposit. The collateral deposit requirement is calculated at the renewal date of March 1st each year and is based on the prior three years of premium experience. The collateral deposit may be satisfied with either cash and/or investment collateral held in the captive or with a letter of credit. The letter agreement between the Company and SEI expired on March 1, 2020, however, in connection with the Sheehy Settlement Agreement, Sheehy has pledged $0.8 million in cash collateral held in the SEI captive insurance member account, under the CSPA, on or before March 1, 2024. See Note 3, Related Parties - Off Balance Sheet Arrangements - Collateral Security Pledge Agreement, for terms of the agreement. The Company is also responsible for providing any additional collateral that may be requested by the captive.\nLetters of Credit\nEAF entered into an incremental natural gas facilities agreement dated February 24, 2014 with Southwest Gas Corporation (Southwest Gas). Under the terms of the agreement, Southwest Gas agreed to install a pipeline connecting an EAF CNG station to its existing infrastructure at no upfront cost to EAF, and EAF agreed to use Southwest Gas to transport natural gas to the station through its infrastructure. The term was originally five years but has since been modified to ten years. Each year of the ten-year term, EAF is required to make a payment to Southwest Gas equal to $0.1 million minus the amount of delivery and demand charges paid by EAF during the applicable contract year. EAF is required to provide financial security in the form of a letter of credit originally in the amount of $0.5 million, which amount may decrease annually during the term of the agreement and was equal to $0.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs collateral for performance on contracts and as credit guarantees to banks and insurers, we are contingently liable for guarantees of subsidiary obligations under a standby letter of credit. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $0.6 million of the standby letter of credit related to workers compensation and general liabilities accrued in our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNote 11 - Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(a) plan for contractors that are eligible under the Department of Labor Service Contract Act and a 401(k) plan for other salaried employees. Contractors earn contributions that are based on all eligible hours up to the maximum of 40 hours per week and reflect the hourly rates set by the Department of Labor. The designated rates vary based on the contractors work location and specific vehicle type. Employer contributions to the 401(a) plan for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $1.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively.\nNote 12 - Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequence for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income.\nIn evaluating the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Management establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be utilized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income, which must occur prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the tax benefit or expense from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest and penalties associated with tax positions are recorded as general and administrative expenses. Tax years that remain subject to examination include 2019 through the current year for federal and generally 2018 through the current year for state purposes.\nIncome tax expense reported in the consolidated statements of operations is comprised of the following:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\nCurrent income tax expense\nFederal\n$\n(24\n)\n$\nState, net of state tax credits\n1,276\nTotal current income tax expense\n1,463\nDeferred income tax expense\nFederal\n2,022\nState and local\n(204\n)\nValuation allowance\n(2,422\n)\nTotal deferred income tax expense\nTotal income tax expense\n$\n$\n1,543\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate applied to pre-tax accounting net income (loss), compared to the income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\nExpected federal tax (benefit)\n$\n(3,688\n)\n21.0\n%\n$\n3,317\n21.0\n%\nState tax provision, net of federal benefit\n(268\n)\n1.5\n%\n1,743\n11.0\n%\nPrior year true up\n-2.0\n%\n2.1\n%\nChange in tax rate\n0.0\n%\n-\n0.0\n%\nEffect of increase in valuation allowance\n-0.3\n%\n(2,422\n)\n-15.3\n%\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\n(4,139\n)\n23.6\n%\n4.2\n%\nEquity-related interest\n3,645\n-20.8\n%\n-\n0.0\n%\nDebt extinguishment\n4,155\n-23.7\n%\n-\n0.0\n%\nPPP loan forgiveness\n-\n0.0\n%\n(2,651\n)\n-16.8\n%\nInterest\n-3.3\n%\n3.3\n%\nOther permanent differences\n(33\n)\n0.2\n%\n0.2\n%\nIncome tax expense\n$\n-3.8\n%\n$\n1,543\n9.8\n%\nThe effective tax rates for the income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are -3.8% and 9.8%, respectively. The differences are primarily due to state taxes and the change in valuation allowance, the change in the fair value of warrant liabilities and equity related interest.\nThe following are the components of the Companys net deferred taxes for federal and state income taxes:\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets\nAccrued expenses and other\n$\n3,466\n$\n2,269\nDebt discount\nInterest\n5,190\n5,033\nStock-based compensation\nLease liabilities\n11,029\n10,018\nLoss carryforwards\n9,771\n11,123\nTotal deferred tax assets\n30,888\n29,894\nValuation allowance\n(16,752\n)\n(16,703\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n14,136\n13,191\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nPrepaid expenses\n(80\n)\n(99\n)\nLease assets\n(9,997\n)\n(8,268\n)\nFixed assets and intangible assets\n(4,267\n)\n(4,921\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(14,344\n)\n(13,288\n)\nNet non-current deferred tax liability\n$\n(208\n)\n$\n(97\n)\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the lack of sustained profitability in recent years. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company's projections for future growth.\nOn the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, a valuation allowance of $16.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively, has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted based on changes in objective and subjective evidence in future years. If and when the Company determines the valuation allowance should be released (i.e., reduced), the adjustment would result in a tax benefit reported in that periods consolidated statement of operations, the effect of which would be an increase in reported net income. The amount of any such tax benefit associated with release of the Company's valuation allowance in a particular reporting period may be material.\nEVO TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY SERVICES, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state net operating losses of approximately $38.4 million and $26.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating losses of approximately $44.7 million and $30.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $0.7 million of federal net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for 20 years and will begin to expire in 2036. The remaining $37.7 million of federal net operating losses are carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income up to an 80% limitation of taxable income in the year of use. The state net operating losses began to expire in 2022. These federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a full valuation allowance because, based on the available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. If the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no uncertain tax positions or interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties associated with tax positions are recorded in the period assessed as general and administrative expenses, if any.\nNote 13 - Subsequent Events\nLoan Dispute Settlement\nOn April 14, 2023, EVO, Titan CNG LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVO (Titan CNG), Falcon Capital, LLC (Falcon) and Scott Honour (a former member of EVOs board of directors), entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement) pursuant to which the parties settled the dispute between EVO and Titan, on the one hand, and Falcon and Mr. Honour, on the other hand, relating to that certain Loan Agreement, dated December 31, 2014, among Tradition Capital Bank, Titan El Toro LLC and Titan CNG, certain equipment located in Fort Worth, Texas, and compensation for board service.\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, (i) the parties settled all claims relating to the lawsuit by Falcon against Titan CNG and EVO, (ii) EVO agreed to pay Falcon $60,000, (iii) EVO issued Falcon an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $250,000 (the Promissory Note), (iv) Falcon released all security interests and liens in all physical property of EVO and Titan CNG, (v) the parties agreed on a process by which to sell the equipment and on the distribution of net proceeds from such sale and (vi) Falcon and Honour released all right, title and interest in and to Titan CNG, EVO and EVOs subsidiaries.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nDismissal of Marcum LLP and appointment of Grant Thornton LLP\nAs previously disclosed in a current report filed with the SEC on September 8, 2021, the audit committee of EVOs board of directors approved the dismissal of Marcum LLP (Marcum) and approved the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP (Grant Thornton) as EVOs new independent registered public accounting firm.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, which includes the date of Marcums dismissal, (1) there were no disagreements between the Company and Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Marcum would have caused it to make reference thereto in its reports on the Companys financial statements for such years and (2) there were no reportable events within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K except as previously disclosed.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not consult with Grant Thornton on either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that may be rendered on the Companys financial statements, and Grant Thornton did not provide either a written report or oral advice to the Company that Grant Thornton concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, or a reportable event, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Companys management, with the participation of its principal executive and financial officers, is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) (\"Exchange Act\") that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn accordance with Exchange Act rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Company performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys principal executive and financial officers regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Companys management, including its principal executive and financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below in Evaluation of Internal Controls and Procedures including limitations in managements evaluation of internal controls as a result of insufficient documentation of internal controls under the standards of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 Framework). In light of these material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and procedures in order to ensure that our financial statements included in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when read with the notes thereto, present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nEvaluation of Internal Controls and Procedures\nThe Companys management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys principal executive designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on the Companys evaluation, it identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, and management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as described below. The Company also took steps seeking to mitigate and remediate these material weaknesses as described under Managements Remediation Plan and Status of Remediation Efforts below.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Companys management considered to be material weaknesses were:\nThe Company had not fully implemented the necessary internal controls under the COSO (2013 Framework) to design, test and evaluate the operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;\nThe Companys management and board of directors had insufficient oversight of the design and operating effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting including the appropriate segregation of duties and effective controls over certain information technology general controls (ITGCs) for IT systems that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements;\nThe Company had insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements;\nThe Company failed to maintain effective controls over the period-end financial reporting process, including controls with respect to identification of unrecorded liabilities; revenue reconciliations to ensure appropriate revenue recognition; accounting for leasing transactions; payroll reconciliations; preparation and disclosure of provision for income taxes; and account-level reconciliations in the general ledger, resulting in numerous adjusting entries identified by the Company and identified through audit procedures;\nThe Company did not have sufficient internal personnel resources to review the financial statements and notes to the financial statements prepared by external consultants and professionals to ensure accuracy and completeness; and\nThe Company failed to maintain effective controls over journal entries, both recurring and nonrecurring, and did not maintain proper segregation of duties. Journal entries were not always accompanied by sufficient supporting documentation and were not adequately reviewed and approved for validity, completeness and accuracy. In most instances, persons responsible for reviewing journal entries for validity, completeness and accuracy were also responsible for preparation.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no significant changes to the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management has implemented or intends to implement, as applicable, the remediation steps discussed below to address the material weaknesses and to improve our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Remediation Plan and Status of Remediation Efforts\nIn light of the control deficiencies identified at December 31, 2022, and described in the section titled Evaluation of Internal Controls and Procedures, we have designed and either have implemented or plan to implement the specific remediation initiatives described below:\nMore robust corporate governance including: (1) direct oversight of our internal controls by the audit committee of our board of directors; (2) review of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q by our audit committee prior to filing with the SEC; and (3) communication of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to our employees and consultants.\nWe intend to implement procedures designed to ensure timely review of the consolidated financial statements, notes to our consolidated financial statements, and our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q by our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, our board of directors, and our audit committee, prior to filing with the SEC.\nWe intend to develop and implement enhanced internal control review procedures and documentation standards aligned with the COSO 2013 Framework.\nA formalized financial reporting process that includes balance sheet and other reconciliations, properly prepared, supported and reviewed journal entries, properly segregated duties, and properly completed and approved close checklist and calendar.\nOur technology platform (Netsuite) to support the formalized financial reporting process described above.\nWe have hired additional experienced individuals to prepare and approve the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe have relied and will continue to rely upon outside professionals to assist with our external reporting requirements to ensure the filing of our required reports with the SEC.\nWe have initiated efforts to ensure our employees understand the continued importance of internal controls and compliance with corporate policies and procedures. We have implemented a reporting and certification process for management involved in the performance of internal controls and the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nWhile the Company believes the steps taken to date and those planned for implementation will improve the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, it has not completed all remediation efforts identified above. Accordingly, the Company has and will continue to perform additional procedures and employ additional tools and resources it determines necessary to ensure that its consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in all material respects.\nThe Company believes the remediation measures will strengthen the Companys internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses identified. Management will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these remediation measures and will make changes and take other actions that are appropriate given the circumstances. Item 9B.

On August 13, 2018, the Board approved an Amended and Restated 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the Amended 2018 Plan), amending and restating the 2018 Plan in its entirety. The principal provisions of the Amended 2018 Plan are summarized below. This summary is not a complete description of all the Amended 2018 Plans provisions and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended 2018 Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to EVOs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Amended 2018 Plan.\nOn May 30, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved the 2023 AIP and the forms of restricted stock unit award agreements to be granted under the Amended 2018 Plan. See Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13, Subsequent Events, for descriptions thereof.\nAmended 2018 Plan\nAdministration\nThe Board delegated the administration of the Amended 2018 Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Board and any committee to which it may delegate the administration of the Amended 2018 Plan from time to time are collectively referred to in the Amended 2018 Plan as the Administrator.\nThe Administrator may delegate to one or more committees and/or sub-committees, or to one or more officers of EVO such administrative duties or powers as it may deem advisable. The Administrator may, by resolution, authorize one or more officers of EVO to do one or both of the following on the same basis as the Administrator: (i) designate employees to be recipients of awards under the Amended 2018 Plan and (ii) determine the size of any such awards; provided, however, that the committee may not delegate such responsibilities to any such officer for awards granted to an employee who is an officer or director of EVO or the beneficial owner of more than 10% of EVOs common stock; the resolution providing such authorization sets forth the total number of awards such officer(s) may grant; and the officer(s) must report periodically to the Administrator regarding the nature and scope of the awards granted pursuant to the authority delegated.\nExcept as otherwise provided in the Amended 2018 Plan, the Administrator will have all of the powers vested in it under the provisions of the Amended 2018 Plan, including but not limited to exclusive authority to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an award will be granted; the individuals to whom, and the time or times at which, awards will be granted; the number of shares subject to each award; the exercise price of Options granted hereunder; and the performance criteria, if any, and any other terms and conditions of each award. The Administrator will have full power and authority to administer and interpret the Amended 2018 Plan, to make and amend rules, regulations and guidelines for administering the Amended 2018 Plan, to prescribe the form and conditions of the respective Agreements evidencing each award (which may vary from Participant to Participant), to amend or revise Agreements evidencing any award (to the extent the amended terms would be permitted by the Amended 2018 Plan and provided that no such revision or amendment, except as is authorized in Section 14 of the Amended 2018 Plan, may impair the terms and conditions of any award that is outstanding on the date of such revision or amendment to the material detriment of the Participant in the absence of the consent of the Participant), and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Amended 2018 Plan (including to correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Amended 2018 Plan or any Agreement, to the extent permitted by law and the Amended 2018 Plan). The Administrators interpretation of the Amended 2018 Plan, and all actions taken and determinations made by the Administrator pursuant to the power vested in it under the Amended 2018 Plan will be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned.\nEligibility\nAny employee, director or consultant may participate in the Amended 2018 Plan; provided, however, that only employees are eligible to receive incentive stock options. Additionally, EVO may grant certain performance-based awards to covered employees in compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. These covered employees include our executive officers. Section 162(m) generally limits the corporate tax deduction for compensation paid to executive officers that is not performance-based to $1,000,000 per executive officer. Performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements is not counted against the $1,000,000 limit and generally remains fully deductible for tax purposes.\nShares Available for Awards\nThe stock to be awarded or optioned under the Plan (the share authorization) will consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of common stock. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved and available for awards under the Amended 2018 Plan originally was 6,250,000 shares and subsequently was increased to 12,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment for any reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, rights offering, divestiture or extraordinary dividend (including a spin-off) or any other similar change in the corporate structure or shares of EVO. Any adjustment determination made by the Administrator will be final, binding and conclusive.\nType of Awards and Terms and Conditions\nThe Amended 2018 Plan provides that the Administrator may grant awards to eligible participants in any of the following forms, subject to such terms, conditions and provisions as the Administrator may determine to be necessary or desirable:\nstock options, including both incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options;\nstock appreciation rights;\nrestricted stock;\nperformance awards; and\nstock bonuses.\nOptions. Options may either be incentive stock options, which are specifically designated as such for purposes of compliance with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-qualified stock options. Options vest as determined by the Administrator, subject to applicable performance objectives and statutory limitations regarding the maximum term of ISOs and the maximum value of ISOs that may vest in one year. The exercise price of each share subject to an ISO will be equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share on the date of the grant of the ISO, except in the case of an ISO grant to a stockholder who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of EVO or its parent or any subsidiary, the exercise price will be equal to or greater than 110% of the fair market value of a share on the grant date. Non-qualified stock options vest as determined by the Administrator, subject to applicable performance objectives and statutory limitations regarding the maximum term of non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of each share subject to a non-qualified stock option will be determined by the Administrator at the time of grant but must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share on the date of grant. Recipients of options have no rights as stockholders with respect to any shares covered by the award until the award is exercised and a stock certificate or book entry evidencing such shares is issued or made, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Awards. Restricted stock awards consist of shares granted to a participant that are subject to one or more risks of forfeiture. Restricted stock awards may be subject to risk of forfeiture based on the passage of time or the satisfaction of other criteria, such as continued employment or Company performance. Recipients of restricted stock awards are entitled to vote and receive dividends attributable to the shares underlying the awards beginning on the grant date, but have no other rights as stockholders with respect to such shares.\nPerformance Awards. Performance awards, which may be denominated in cash or shares, are earned upon achievement of performance objectives during a performance period established by the Administrator. Recipients of performance awards have no rights as stockholders with respect to any shares covered by the awards until the date a stock certificate or book entry evidencing such shares is issued or made, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights. A stock appreciation right may be granted independent of, or in tandem with, a previously or contemporaneously granted stock option, as determined by the Administrator. Generally, upon exercise of a stock appreciation right, the recipient will receive cash, shares of EVO stock, or a combination of cash and stock, with a value equal to the excess of: (i) the fair market value of a specified number of shares of EVO stock on the date of the exercise, over (ii) a specified exercise price. Stock appreciation rights vest as determined by the Administrator, subject to applicable performance objectives and statutory limitations regarding the maximum term of stock appreciation rights. Recipients of stock appreciation rights have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by the award until the date a stock certificate or book entry evidencing such shares is issued or made, respectively.\nStock Bonuses. Stock bonuses consist of awards of shares granted to a participant subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Administrator. Recipients of stock bonuses have all rights of stockholders with respect to such shares, provided that the Administrator may impose restrictions on the assignment or transfer of stock bonuses.\nAmendments of the Amended 2018 Plan\nThe Board may from time to time, insofar as permitted by law, suspend or discontinue the Amended 2018 Plan or revise or amend it in any respect. However, to the extent required by applicable law or regulation or as except as provided under the Amended 2018 Plan itself, the Board may not, without stockholder approval, revise or amend the Amended 2018 Plan to (i) materially increase the number of shares subject to the Amended 2018 Plan, (ii) change the designation of participants, including the class of employees, eligible to receive awards, (iii) decrease the price at which options or stock appreciation rights may be granted, (iv) cancel, regrant, repurchase for cash, or replace options or stock appreciation rights that have an exercise price in excess of the fair market value of the common stock with other awards, or amend the terms of outstanding options or stock appreciation rights to reduce their exercise price, (v) materially increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Amended 2018 Plan, or (vi) make any modification that will cause incentive stock options to fail to meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 422.\nTerm\nThe Administrator may grant awards pursuant to the Amended 2018 Plan until it is discontinued or terminated; provided, however, that ISOs may not be granted after August 13, 2028.\nChange of Control\nUnless otherwise provided in the terms of an award, upon a change of control of EVO, as defined in the Amended 2018 Plan, the Administrator may provide for one or more of the following: (i) the acceleration of the exercisability, vesting, or lapse of the risks of forfeiture of any or all awards (or portions thereof); (ii) the complete termination of the Amended 2018 Plan and the cancellation of any or all awards (or portions thereof) that have not been exercised, have not vested, or remain subject to risks of forfeiture, as applicable in each case as of the effective date of the change of control; (iii) that the entity succeeding EVO by reason of such change of control, or the parent of such entity, must assume or continue any or all awards (or portions thereof) outstanding immediately prior to the change of control or substitute for any or all such awards (or portions thereof) a substantially equivalent award with respect to the securities of such successor entity, as determined in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; or (iv) that participants holding outstanding awards will become entitled to receive, with respect to each share of common stock subject to such award (whether vested or unvested, as determined by the Administrator pursuant to the Amended 2018 Plan) as of the effective date of any such change of control, cash in an amount equal to (1) for participants holding options or stock appreciation rights, the excess of the fair market value of such common stock on the date immediately preceding the effective date of such change of control over the exercise price per share of options or stock appreciation rights, or (2) for participants holding awards other than options or stock appreciation rights, the fair market value of such common stock on the date immediately preceding the effective date of such change of control. The Administrator need not take the same action with respect to all awards (or portions thereof) or with respect to all participants.\nPayment\nUpon exercise of an option granted under the Amended 2018 Plan, and as permitted in the Administrators discretion, the option holder may pay the exercise price in cash (or cash equivalent), by surrendering previously-acquired unencumbered shares of Company common stock, by withholding shares of Company common stock from the number of shares that would otherwise be issuable upon exercise of the option (e.g., a net share settlement), through broker-assisted cashless exercise (if compliant with applicable securities laws and any insider trading policies of the Company), another form of payment authorized by the Administrator, or a combination of any of the foregoing. If the exercise price is paid, in whole or in part, with Company common stock, the then-current fair market value of the stock delivered or withheld will be used to calculate the number of shares required to be delivered or withheld.\nTransfer Restrictions\nUnless permitted by law and expressly permitted by the Amended 2018 Plan or underlying award agreement, no award will be transferable, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Administrator may permit a recipient of a non-qualified stock option to transfer the award by gift to his or her immediate family or to certain trusts or partnerships (as defined and permitted by applicable federal securities law).\nForms of Agreement\nThe Administrator has approved forms of agreement to govern incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The foregoing summaries of the Amended 2018 Plan and the forms of the agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the Amended 2018 Plan and to the text of the forms of agreement, all of which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2021 AIP and LTIP\nOn August 17, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved the EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. 2021 Annual Incentive Plan (the 2021 AIP), to provide the terms of annual bonus opportunities to be granted to the Companys executive officers and other participating employees. The purposes of the 2021 AIP are to maintain a competitive level of total cash compensation and to align the interests of the Companys executives and other employees with those of the Companys shareholders and with the strategic objectives of the Company.\nThe 2021 AIP provides the Companys executive officers and other participating employees with an opportunity to earn cash incentive compensation based upon the achievement of performance goals over a specified performance period. All of the Companys executive officers and certain other employees designated as eligible employees from time to time are eligible to participate in the 2021 AIP. The 2021 AIP focuses on achievement of certain annual objectives and goals, as determined by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each calendar year, and provides that the participants may earn a pre-determined percentage of their respective base salaries for the achievement of such specified goals. Under the 2021 AIP, the payout opportunity is contingent upon meeting the threshold performance levels, and thereafter varies for performance above and below the pre-established target performance levels, subject to a maximum award level. With respect to EVOs chief executive officer, the target award equals 50% of 2021 base salary, and with respect to EVOs other named executive officers the target award equals 40% of base salary, all as adjusted based upon meeting or exceeding the performance levels established by the Compensation Committee for 2021, and cannot exceed a maximum payment limit specified by the Compensation Committee. The 2021 AIP also provides that each named executive officers award will be forfeited if such executive officers employment does not continue through December 31 of the applicable plan year.\nThe performance metrics on which awards under the 2021 AIP were granted include 2021 revenue and EBITDA, and payment of incentive awards under the 2021 AIP is dependent upon achievement of defined goals for each performance metric. However, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to increase, reduce or eliminate any incentive award that becomes payable under the 2021 AIP. Awards under the 2021 AIP will be granted for services provided in calendar year 2021 and will be payable in 2022. Incentive awards under the 2021 AIP are paid in cash following the end of calendar year 2021 and after the Compensation Committee has determined and certified the level of performance achieved and the incentive awards earned.\nAlso on August 17, 2021, the Compensation Committee approved the EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. 2021 Annual Incentive Plan (the 2021 LTIP), pursuant to which the Company expects to make annual long term incentive awards based on shares of EVOs common stock, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and non-statutory stock options. Awards under the 2021 will be made under and pursuant to the terms of the Amended 2018 Plan. Under the 2021 LTIP, the Compensation Committee will make time-based RSU and stock option awards to key employees, including the named executive officers. The value of the 2021 LTIP awards will be based upon a percentage of the named executive officers salary. Under the 2021 LTIP, a named executive officers 2021 LTIP award is comprised of 50% of time-based RSUs and 50% stock options. Time-based RSU awards under the 2021 LTIP will vest three years from the date of grant, and stock option awards will vest ratably in one-third increments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of the grant conditional upon continued employment with the Company.\nSee Note 13, Subsequent Events, for a description of the Annual Incentive Plan of EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. and the restricted stock unit award agreements, each of which was approved in May 2023.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe table below provides summary information about the securities issuable under our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2022:\nPlan category\nNumber of\nsecurities to\nbe issued\nupon exercise\nof outstanding\noptions,\nwarrants\nand rights\n(a)\nWeighted-\naverage\nexercise price\nof outstanding\noptions, warrants\nand rights\n(b)\nNumber of\nsecurities\nremaining\navailable for\nfuture issuance\nunder equity\ncompensation\nplans (excluding\nsecurities\nreflected\nin column\n(a))\n(c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders\n-\n-\n-\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders\n9,627,942\n$\n2.03\n2,372,058\nTotal\n9,627,942\n$\n2.03\n2,372,058 Item 13. Certain Relationships, Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nTransactions with Related Persons\nAccounts Payable - Related Party\nOn February 15, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to lease software technology for operations from a company owned by one of the Companys officers.

Accordingly, EVO is no longer obligated to redeem the common stock held by SEI. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, redeemable common stock was $0 and $1.2 million, respectively.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements - Collateral Security Pledge Agreement\nOn January 2, 2019 EVO acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Sheehy. Sheehy is engaged in the business of fulfilling government contracts for freight trucking services, as well as providing freight trucking services to non-government entities. On January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a letter agreement with SEI, to satisfy the Sheehy captive insurance security deposit requirement for 2019 (see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Arrangements - Captive Insurance). The letter agreement references a Collateral Security Pledge Agreement among SEI, Sheehy and the insurance captive (CSPA). In connection with the Sheehy Settlement Agreement, Sheehy pledged $0.8 million in cash collateral held in the SEI captive insurance member account, under the CSPA, on or before March 1, 2024, and SEI agreed to continue its collateral pledge until that time.\nCreditor Exchange Agreements\nAs noted in Note 5, Debt, Danny Cuzick, John and Ursula Lampsa and Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. exchanged historical promissory notes issued by EVO and its subsidiaries for (i) warrants to purchase shares of EVO common stock; (ii) a $75,000 payment and (iii) the Takeback Notes resulting in a restructuring gain of approximately $9.0 million recorded within additional paid-in-capital as of December 31, 2022.\nAmendments to Leases\nIn connection with the Recapitalization Transactions, Ursa Major Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVO (Ursa), entered into two separate lease amendments with Ursa Oak Creek LLC and Ursa Group LLC. The amendments provided that the monthly offset payments under Ursas leases will continue until the earliest of (i) September 8, 2027, (ii) the date that the Takeback Note issued to John and Ursula Lampsa is satisfied in full, and (iii) the date the lease is terminated other than for Ursas breach. See Note 5, Debt, for further information regarding the Takeback Notes.\nPurchase of Fixed Assets\nOn October 15, 2019, EVO entered into an agreement with an existing stockholder to purchase used CNG tractors in exchange for 1,174,800 shares of EVOs common stock and a warrant to purchase 1,174,800 shares of EVOs common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. Although the transaction was not consummated, the Company recorded $3.5 million related to the tractors within property and equipment, net on its consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report, with an associated $3.5 million related to EVOs obligation to issue the common stock and the warrant to purchase common stock within common stock issuable. In October 2023, EVO, the stockholder and his affiliated company entered into a settlement agreement to mutually rescind the transaction.\nFor information regarding additional related party transactions, see Note 5, Debt, and Note 6, Stockholders Deficit and Warrants.\nDirector Independence\nOur securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or on any inter-dealer quotation system which has a requirement that a majority of directors be independent. We evaluate independence by the standards for director independence set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Rules.\nUnder NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2)(A), a director is not considered to be independent if he or she also is an executive officer or employee of the corporation. In considering a directors independence, the Board considers any related party transactions that currently exist or have occurred during the timeframes specified by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and whether the director has any relationships that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board determined that Messrs. Anderson, Coelho, Smith and Zyngier are independent within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rules. Messrs. Bansal, Bayles and Posner are not independent directors.
