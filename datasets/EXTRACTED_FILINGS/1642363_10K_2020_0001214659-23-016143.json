    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral Overview\nWe were incorporated on April 29, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We originally intended to engage in the business of developing, marketing and sell shampoo, conditioner and other hair care products made from natural ingredients. Initial operations included organization and incorporation, target market identification, marketing plans, capital formation and property acquisitions. However, we are no longer in the business of developing and selling shampoo, conditioner or any other hair care products. We are presently considered a shell company and our current business plan is to seek to acquire a viable ongoing business either by acquisition, merger or other form of business combination transaction. In accordance with our current business model, on December 28, 2017 we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended January 9, 2018 (Merger Agreement), with Yuenglings Ice Cream Corporation, a private Pennsylvania corporation (Yuenglings). On June 13, 2018, the Company informed Yuenglings by written notice that the Company has terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 28, 2017. The reason for the termination was the failure of Yuenglings to complete the audit of its financial statements as required by the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nCorporate Facilities\nOur administrative and executive offices located at 311 Bay Street, Unit 3405, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 4G5 which are provided by our Chief Executive Officer without charge.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act 0f 2012 (JOBS Act) and may take advantage of certain exemptions from certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies included but not limited to, not being required to comply with auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in a three year period; (iii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,as amended; or (iv) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliated exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nTo the extent we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as smaller reporting company including (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (ii) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (iii) the requirement to provide only two years of audited consolidated financial statements instead of three. Item 1A Risk Factors.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.  Item 2. Properties\nWe do not own any properties at this time and do not have presently any agreements to acquire any properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not involved in any legal proceedings Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur stock symbol on OTC Pink is SNHR. Our common stock is not currently quoted on the OTC Pink inter-dealer quotation service maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc., accordingly, there is presently no active public market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, known as the Penny Stock Rule, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, brokers/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to sale. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also has rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in that security is provided by the exchange or system. The Penny Stock Rules requires a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation. These disclosure requirements have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result of these rules, investors may find it difficult to sell their shares.\nAs of the date of this report, we have 14,578,506 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by 17 stockholders of record.\nDividend Policy\nTo date, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. It is anticipated that our future earnings will be retained to finance our continuing development. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the exploration and growth of our business, our Board of Directors has the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we did not issue any shares of common or preferred stock. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nThere is no selected financial data required to be filed for a smaller reporting company. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.\nPlan of Operations\nAt the present time, the Company has no business operations. The Company will continue to seek other business opportunities either through the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company with ongoing business operations. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had not generated any revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. At March 31, 2020, the Company had sustained net loss of $17,503 and had an accumulated deficit of $268,412.\nThe Companys independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon these operations successfully generating cash flow for the Company, financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of the target company with the Company.\nBalance sheet at March 31, 2020 and 2019\nCash\nAt March 31, 2020 we had cash of $0 compared to $26 as of March 31, 2019.\nPrepaid asset\nAt March 31, 2020 we had prepaid expenses of $24,411 compared to $1,920 as at March 31, 2019.\nAccrued liabilities\nAccrued liabilities at March 31, 2020 totaled $3,445 compared to $2,257 as at March 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to the issuance by the Company of convertible promissory notes and promissory notes payable.\nPayable to related parties\nAt March 31, 2020, the Company had no convertible notes payable and promissory notes payable to related parties compared to no convertible notes or promissory notes payable to related parties payable at March 31, 2019.\nAt March 31, 2020, the Company had related party loan amounts of $58,270 compared to $19,490 as of March 31, 2019.\nShareholder advances and receivable\nShareholder advances represent expenses paid by the owners from personal funds. The amount of advances at March 31, 2020 was $236 which was the same amount at March 31, 2019.\nIncome statement for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenues for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe Company did not have any revenues from any sources in 2020 or 2019 and no revenues are expected in the near term until the Company locates and completes an acquisition of an operational business.\nExpenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nOperating expenses decreased from $35,246 as of March 31, 2019 to $17,503 as of March 31, 2020. The decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in professional fees for legal and accounting services associated with the Companys financial and periodic reports filed obligations with the SEC.\nOther income for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe Company had Other Income and Expenses of $0 and $7,359 as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Other Income and Expenses in the year ended March 30, 2019, amounted to Gain on Extinguishment of debt of $10,000, Gain on mark to market of derivative of $12,857, net of Derivative discount amortization of $5,000 and Interest Expenses of $10,498.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019\nWe had nominal assets at both March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2020, we had $0 in cash as compared to $26 in cash at March 31, 2019. Total liabilities at March 31, 2020 were $79,451. At March 31, 2019, liabilities totaled $39,483. Unless our officers/related stockholders continue to advance funds to the Company, of which there can be no assurance, or the Company receives an infusion of capital, it is unlikely that the Company will continue operations. At March 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $(268,412) as compared to $(250,909) at March 31, 2019.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nAs reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2020, a net loss, and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may never be sufficient to commence and support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 and 2019\nPage\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nStatements of Stockholders Equity\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to the Financial Statements -\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Seguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Seguin Natural Hair Products, Inc. (the Company) as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two-year period ended March 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit and net losses since inception. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nFruci & Associates II, PLLC - PCAOB ID #05525\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nSpokane, Washington\nDecember 7, 2023\nSEGUIN NATURAL HAIR PRODUCTS, INC.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019\nFinancial Statements\nBalance Sheets as of March 31, 2020 and 2019\nStatements of Operations for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nStatements of Stockholders' Equity for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nStatements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to Financial Statements -\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nBalance Sheets\nMarch 31,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash $ - $ 26\nPrepaid expense and other current assets 24,411 1,920\nTotal Current Assets 24,411 1,946\nTotal Assets $ 24,411 $ 1,946\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 3,445 $ 2,257\nCompensation payable 17,500 17,500\nAdvances from stockholders\nLoan payable - related party 58,270 19,490\nTotal Current Liabilities 79,451 39,483\nTotal Liabilities 79,451 39,483\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSTOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT:\nCommon stock par value $0.0001: 500,000,000 shares authorized;\n14,578,506 shares issued and outstanding as of\nMarch 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 1,457 1,457\nAdditional paid-in capital 190,915 190,915\nCommon shares to be issued 21,000 21,000\nAccumulated deficit (268,412 ) (250,909 )\nTotal Stockholders' Deficit (55,040 ) (37,537 )\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders' Deficit $ 24,411 $ 1,946\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nStatements of Operations\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\nOperating Expenses\nProfessional fees $ 17,477 $ 14,751\nGeneral and administrative expenses 20,495\nTotal operating expenses 17,503 35,246\nLoss from Operations (17,503 ) (35,246 )\nOther Income and Expenses\nGain on Extinguishment of debt - 10,000\nGain (loss) on mark to market of derivative - 12,857\nDerivative discount amortization - (5,000 )\nInterest expense - (10,498 )\nTotal other income (expense) - 7,359\nIncome Tax Provision - -\nNet Loss $ (17,503 ) $ (27,887 )\nNet Loss per Common Share - Basic and Diluted $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 )\nWeighted average common shares outstanding: - basic and diluted 14,578,506 8,630,918\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders' Deficit\nFor the Years Ended March 31, 2020 and 2019\nCommon Stock, $0.0001 Par Value\nAdditional\nTotal\nNumber of\nShares to be Paid-in Accumulated Stockholders'\nShares Amount issued Capital Deficit (Deficit)\nBalance, April 1, 2018 5,825,000 $ 582 $ - $ 92,767 $ (223,022 ) $ (129,673 )\nCommon stock issued upon conversion of Debt 8,753,506 21,000 98,148 - 120,023\nNet loss\n(27,887 ) (27,887 )\nBalance, March 31, 2019 14,578,506 $ 1,457 $ 21,000 $ 190,915 $ (250,909 ) $ (37,537 )\nNet Loss - - - - (17,503 ) (17,503 )\nBalance, March 31, 2020 14,578,506 $ 1,457 $ 21,000 $ 190,915 $ (268,412 ) $ (55,040 )\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nStatements of Cash Flows\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES:\nNet loss $ (17,503 ) $ (27,887 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities\nChange in fair value of derivatives - (12,857 )\nGain on extinguishment of debt - (10,000 )\nAmortization on debt discount - 5,000\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nPrepaid Expenses (22,491 ) (1,306 )\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,188 32,466\nNet cash used in operating activities (38,806 ) (14,584 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES:\nProceeds from loan - related parties 38,780 14,000\nNet cash provided by financing activities 38,780 14,000\nNet change in cash (26 ) (584 )\nCash at beginning of the reporting period\nCash at end of the reporting period $ - $ 26\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOWS INFORMATION:\nInterest paid $ - $ -\nIncome tax paid $ - $ -\nSUPPLIMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS\nIssuance of shares upon conversion of notes payable $ - $ 120,023\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Organization\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on April 29, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Initial operations have included organization and incorporation, target market identification, marketing plans, capital formation and property acquisitions. A substantial portion of the Companys activities has involved developing a business plan and establishing contacts and visibility in the marketplace. The Company has generated no revenues since inception.\nWe are no longer in the business of developing and selling shampoo, conditioner or any other hair care products.\nThe Company has no operations at this time and currently does not have any principal products or services, customers, or intellectual property. As the Company has no current operations, it also currently is not subject to any competitive business conditions. Further, the Company is not subject to any government approvals at this time, other than those applicable to it as a shell company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.\nNote 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices\nThe Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nFiscal Year End\nThe Company elected March 31st as its fiscal year end date upon its formation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period(s).\nCritical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Companys critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:\n(i) Assumption as a going concern: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business;\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(ii) Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets: Management assumes that the realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, (d) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.\nThese significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nManagement regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nReclassification of certain amounts\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10- 35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35- 37 are described below:\nLevel 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of this instrument.\nTransactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a. affiliates of the Company (Affiliate means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\nCommitment and Contingencies\nThe Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASC 606-10-50-5 requires that entities disclose disaggregated revenue information in categories (such as type of good or service, geography, market, type of contract, etc.) that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow are affected by economic factors. ASC 606-10-55-89 explains that the extent to which an entity's revenue is disaggregated depends on the facts and circumstances that pertain to the entity's contracts with customers and that some entities may need to use more than one type of category to meet the objective for disaggregating revenue. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, and allowed entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. There have been multiple standards updates amending this guidance or providing corrections or improvements on issues in the guidance. The requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This standard permitted adoption using one of two transition methods, either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.\nThe Company adopted these standards for the year ended March 31, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of these standards did not have an impact on the Company's Condensed Statements of Operations.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Section 740-10-25). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\nManagement makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.\nTax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions\nThe Company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share (\"EPS\") is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted- average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.\nPursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.\nThere were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCash Flows Reporting\nThe Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (Indirect method) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company is has reviewed the provisions of this ASU to and determined there will be no material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nThe Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.\nNote 3 - Going Concern\nThe Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15).\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2020, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 4 - Convertible Notes - Related Party\nDebt:\nFrom August 1, 2017, to June 28, 2018, the Company issued various promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $102,145 of which $11,095 was paid directly to the holder to pay for expenses on behalf of the Company. These borrowings were from an investor (the Lender) who has significant influence over the Companys affairs. Interest is 12% to 25% per annum and is payable on demand. For the notes issued between November 14, 2017, and December 4, 2017, in the event of prepayment, the Borrower will pay to Lender 150% of the unpaid principal amount of the notes. For the remainder of the notes, there is no penalty for prepayment. These promissory notes have since been modified to include conversion privileges.\nConversion Terms:\nThe Lender has the right at any time following the 9th anniversary month of the date of the note, to convert the outstanding and unpaid notes principal and interest due into the Companys common shares. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon a conversion hereunder will be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount by Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock as quoted by OTC Markets Group Inc. for the preceding five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion (Conversion Price). In no event, however, will the Conversion Price be less than $0.35 per share.\nConversion of Debt:\nIn December 2018, in a private transaction, the holder of $102,145 in debt sold these notes to an unrelated investor who subsequently converted the outstanding principal debt to common stock, thereby acquiring control of the Company. Effective December 4, 2018, the Company issued 8,753,506 shares of its common stock (Shares) upon the exercise of conversion rights under outstanding convertible promissory notes (Notes). The conversion price for the shares was $0.00927 per share and the aggregate principal amount converted under the Notes was $102,145. As a result of the conversion, the Notes were paid in full and are no longer outstanding obligations of the Company. On December 8th, 2021, the Company issued the additional 2,265,372 shares of common stock for the above conversion. The Shares were issued in compliance with the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation S for transactions not involving a public offering and for offers and sales outside the United States. The additional shares are classified in Common shares to be issued on the balance sheet.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nNote 5 - Related Party Transactions\nAdvances\nFrom time to time, the Company has received advances from its chief executive officer to meet short-term working capital needs. As of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, a total of $58,270 and $19,490 in advances from related parties are outstanding, respectively. These advances are unsecured, bear no interest, and do not have formal repayment terms or arrangements.\nFree Office Space\nThe Company has been provided office space by its Chief Executive Officer at no cost. The management determined that such cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent expense in its financial statement.\nShareholder Advances\nThe balance owed to shareholders as of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 was $236. The advances from shareholders are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and payable on demand.\nManagement Compensation Payable\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company accrued $0 in compensation to be paid to Management for services rendered. The total compensation payable as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 is $17,500.\nNote 6 - Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision\nDeferred Tax Assets\nAt March 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes of $267,048 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2037. No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards because the Company believes that the realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets of approximately $56,080 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.\nDeferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding the probability of its realization. The valuation allowance increased approximately $3,676 and $7,610 for the year ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nComponents of deferred tax assets in the balance sheets are as follows:\nSchedule of deferred tax assets\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nNet deferred tax assets - non-current:\nExpected income tax benefit from NOL carry-forwards $ 56,080 $ 52,404\nLess valuation allowance (56,080 ) (52,404 )\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ - $ -\nIncome Tax Provision in the Statements of Operations\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income tax provision is as follows:\nSchedule of effective income tax rate\nFor the Year\nended March 31,\nFor the Year\nended March 31,\nFederal statutory income tax rate\n21.0%\n21.0%\nNote 7- Subsequent Events\nIssuance of Additional Shares for Conversion\nOn December 8th 2021 the Company issued 2,265,372 shares of common stock it had recorded as Shares to be Issued related to the December 2018 Debt Conversion (See Note 4). Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered by this report. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework or COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2020. Management identified segregation of duties & maintenance of current accounting records as material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement is in the continuous process of improving the internal control over financial reporting by engaging a Certified Public Accountant as a consultant to mitigate some of the identified weaknesses. The Company is still in its development stage and intends on bringing in necessary resources to address the weaknesses once full operations have commenced. Management concludes that internal control over financial reporting is ineffective at March 31, 2020.\nManagements Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during its fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other information\nNot applicable.\nPART III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance;\nAs of the date of this report, the directors and officers of the Company are as follows:\nNAME\nAGE\nPOSITIONS AND OFFICES HELD\nDanny Iandoli\nPresident/CEO and Director\nDanny Iandoli is currently the Company sole officer and director. He has been officer and director since December 6, 2018. Mr, Iandoli is the owner of Dicar Financial Incorporated located in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada which is in business of making and holding real estate mortgage loans on residential and commercial property.\nTerm of Office\nOur director is appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our stockholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers, if any, are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board. All officers and directors listed above will remain in office until the next annual meeting of our stockholders, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. There are no agreements with respect to the election of Directors. We have not compensated our Directors for service on our Board of Directors, any committee thereof, or reimbursed for expenses incurred for attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and/or any committee of our Board of Directors. Officers are appointed annually by our Board of Directors and each Executive Officer serves at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We do not have any standing committees. Our Board of Directors may in the future determine to pay Directors fees and reimburse Directors for expenses related to their activities.\nNone of our officers and/or directors have filed any bankruptcy petition, been convicted of or been the subject of any criminal proceedings or the subject of any order, judgment or decree involving the violation of any state or federal securities laws within the past five (5) years.\nAudit Committee\nAt the present time, we do not have a standing audit committee of the Board of Directors. Management has determined not to establish an audit committee at present because of our limited resources and limited operating activities do not warrant the formation of an audit committee or the expense of doing so. We do not have a financial expert serving on the Board of Directors or employed as an officer based on managements belief that the cost of obtaining the services of a person who meets the criteria for a financial expert under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B is beyond its limited financial resources and the financial skills of such an expert are simply not required or necessary for us to maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in light of the limited scope and simplicity of accounting issues raised in its consolidated financial statements at this stage of its development. We have not formed a Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or any other Board Committee as of the filing of this Annual Report.\nCertain Legal Proceedings\nNo director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the Company has appeared as a party in any legal proceeding material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past five years.\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act\nOur common stock is not presently registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) that applies to our officers, directors and employees including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. A copy of the Code will be provided to any person upon request, without charge. Item 11. Executive Compensation\nThe Company has not to date paid any compensation to any officer or director. The Company intends to pay annual salaries to all its officers and will pay an annual stipend to its directors when, and if, it completes a primary public offering for the sale of securities and/or the Company reaches profitability, experiences positive cash flow and/or obtains additional funding. At such time, the Company anticipates offering cash and non-cash compensation to officers and directors. In addition, although not presently offered, the Company anticipates that its officers and directors will be provided with a group health, vision and dental insurance program at subsidizes rates, or at the sole expense of the Company, as may be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its sole discretion. In addition, the Company plans to offer 401(k) matching funds as a retirement benefit, paid vacation days and paid holidays. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following table sets forth certain information as of regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by (i) our named executive officer, and (ii) each of our directors, (iii) each person we know to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock.
