    "content": "ITEM 1. Business.\nGeneral\nLuvu Brands, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets a portfolio of consumer lifestyle brands through the Companys websites, online mass merchants and specialty retail stores worldwide. Brands include: Liberator\u00ae, a brand category of iconic products for enhancing sensuality and intimacy; Avana\u00ae, Top-of-Bed Comfort products and inclined bed therapy products, assistive in relieving medical conditions associated with acid reflux, surgery recovery and chronic pain; and Jaxx\u00ae, a diverse range of casual fashion daybeds, sofas and beanbags made from virgin and re-purposed polyurethane foam. These products are sold through the Companys websites, online mass merchants and retail stores worldwide. Many of our products are offered flat-packed and either roll or vacuum compressed to save on shipping and reduce our carbon footprint.\nHeadquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, the Company occupies a 140,000 square foot vertically-integrated manufacturing facility.\nThe Companys e-commerce websites include: liberator.com, jaxxbeanbags.com, and avanacomfort.com.\nUnless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to the Company, Luvu Brands, we, our, and us refers to Luvu Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nOur executive offices are located at 2745 Bankers Industrial Dr., Atlanta, GA 30360; our telephone number is +1-770-246-6400.\nOur corporate website is www.LuvuBrands.com. There we make available copies of Luvu Brands documents, news releases and our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, including financial statements.\nUnless specifically set forth to the contrary, the information that appears on our websites or our various social media platforms is not part of this annual report.\nCorporate History\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 25, 1999, under the name of WES Consulting, Inc. On October 19, 2009, the Company entered into a Merger and Recapitalization Agreement (the Merger Agreement) with Liberator, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Old Liberator). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Old Liberator merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as the sole remaining entity. On February 28, 2011, the Company name was changed from WES Consulting, Inc. to Liberator, Inc. Effective November 5, 2015, the Company changed its corporate name from Liberator, Inc. to Luvu Brands, Inc. to reflect its broader offering of wellness and lifestyle products designed for mass market channels.\nOverview of our Facilities and Operations\nSince inception we have used a vertically integrated business model, with manufacturing, distribution, product development, advertising and marketing performed in-house. We believe this allows us to create new products with reduced lead times at a lower cost while enabling us to quickly respond to market and customer demands for our existing products.\nFor our wholesale accounts and international distributors, being able to fulfill large orders with shorter turnaround times allows us to capture business during December and February when wholesale customers make just-in-time holiday purchases.\nOur 140,000 square foot facility on eight acres is located in a suburb of metro Atlanta, Georgia and includes manufacturing and distribution, sales and marketing, product development, customer service and administrative staff. All of the Liberator, Jaxx and Avana branded products are designed, produced and marketed from our facility in Atlanta, Georgia.\nOur Atlanta-based manufacturing operation has two CAD controlled fabric cutters, one CAD controlled wood cutter, two CAD controlled foam contouring machines and two state-of-the-art conveyor unit production sewing systems.\nOur sewing equipment is also highly automated with conveyor-based lines leading into vacuum and roll compression packaging of finished products. We believe that our in-house manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings, as well as strict control over the entire manufacturing cycle including raw material procurement, finished goods production and logistics optimization. In addition to providing us with greater production flexibility, our in-house manufacturing provides us with the opportunity to improve fulfillment response time, reduces the risk of out-of-stock situations, limits finished goods obsolescence and improves overall operating margins.\nBecause fabric cutting, sewing, foam contouring, assembly and vacuum packaging are performed in-house, we believe we can exercise greater control over product quality and respond faster to changing customer demands, which gives us a competitive advantage over companies that utilize only out-sourced sewing services. In addition to our in-house sewing capabilities, we outsource the sewing of certain high-volume products to a contract sewing facility in Mexico.\nWe source raw materials from multiple domestic and foreign suppliers and we have supply contracts in place to produce our specialty fabrics under specific quality control and performance standards with just-in-time deliveries. We also repurpose over 4,000 pounds of polyurethane foam trim each day, primarily for Jaxx bean bags, which gives us a cost and quality competitive advantage.\nIn July 2022 and in July 2023, we acquired and installed two new automated sewing conveyor systems for increased capacity and flexibility. This resulted in increased throughput and lower production costs in these operations, which have been partially offset by increased raw material costs and wages.\nAll business activity of the Company is done through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OneUp Innovations, Inc. (OneUp). OneUp was organized in 2000 and began operations in 2002.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goals are to achieve long-term growth and profitability by expanding our distribution channels and customer base for Liberator, Jaxx and Avana. We create ongoing collections of innovative products that have both good design and price to value that ship flat-packed and vacuum compressed. By running our own websites and aligning ourselves with both mass market and specialty retailers, we leave less room for importers and copy-cats to compete. We believe that marketing directly to the customer is the best way to build brands, and by doing so we create value for our customers and wealth for our shareholders.\n\u00b7\nManufacturing. To improve our business results, we constantly look for ways to manage the impact of rising raw material and labor costs by improving the productivity of our Lean manufacturing processes. As demand for certain high-volume products continues to increase, we plan to shift more of the sewing of those products to a contract facility in Mexico.\n\u00b7\nSustainability. We believe that sustainable operations are both financially and operationally beneficial to our business, and critical to our future success. We are acutely focused on waste reduction efforts: repurposing 98% of our foam trim to other products, compressing all of our foam products to reduce freight costs and corrugated use, improving manufacturing processes to reduce waste overall, finding new ways to repurpose certain waste streams and establishing local recycling partnerships to divert waste from landfills.\n\u00b7\nEco-Packaging. We maintain vacuum compressed packaging to reduce our carbon footprint, make our products more convenient for the consumer and easier to display for the retailer, and reduce our outbound shipping costs.\n\u00b7\nWholesale Operations. Our goal is to increase consumer demand through advertising and public relations while our wholesale operations expand our offering to distributors, retailers and e-tailers across every channel of adult, mass market, drug and specialty accounts. For wholesalers thinking about adding Sexual Wellness products to their retail or online store, our Liberator product line is typically one of the first safer products presented, as it can be promoted as an assistive aid to sexual positioning. As the mainstream demand for Sexual Wellness products grows, our sales staff is training and educating new resellers on how to get started in this category. For retail display, we offer mainstream packaging in a variety of sizes and price points to meet their customers particular demographic. We offer all our brands for sale through various e-tailers, and for these customers we maintain brand continuity by providing rich product content, photography and instructional videos for use on their websites. We also provide fulfillment services and can drop-ship orders directly to their customer, frequently the same day the order is received.\nProducts, Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution\nLiberator Products\nWe developed a patented brand category which we call Liberator Bedroom Adventure Gear\u00ae. The products in this collection are designed to elevate, create motion and create surfaces and textures that expand the sexual repertoire and make the act of love more exciting. Liberator Bedroom Adventure Gear combines functional design with sensuous textures that transform ordinary bedrooms into supportive landscapes for intimacy. Liberator products present angles, elevations, curves and motion that help people of all sizes, including those with back injuries and other medical conditions, find comfortable ways to connect intimately while assisting their stamina and performance.\nLiberator foam-based products (called Liberator Shapes) are manufactured in a variety of heights and widths to accommodate variations in the human body. They consist of differently shaped cushions and props that are available in an assortment of fabric colors to add to the visual excitement. Each of the product profiles of the Liberator Shapes is unique, designed to introduce positions to the sexual experience that were previously difficult to achieve or impossible to achieve with standard pillows or cushions. Liberator Shapes are manufactured from structured polyurethane foam, cut at various angles, platforms and profiles. The foam base is encased in a tight, fluid resistant polyester shell, helping the cushions to maintain their shape. Liberator Shapes that are designed to be used in tandem are covered in a proprietary microfiber cover that allow the Shapes to adhere to each-other without slipping loose. This allows for positioning freedom.\nWe have also developed vacuum compressed large profile designs that are commonly referred to as Love Loungers or Tantric / Yoga Chaises. Most of the sex furniture pieces are made from contoured polyurethane foam and covered in a variety of fabrics and colors. These items are marketed as the Esse\u00ae Chaise, Equus Wave\u00ae and Prelude\u00ae Bench all in a variety of sizes. Larger designs include products based on shredded polyurethane foam trim encased in a wide range of fabric types and colors and sold under our Zeppelin \u00ae product offering. The Liberator larger profile designs can also be used as lounge seating when not being used for relaxed interaction and creative intimacy. Newer styles are now flat packed with wooden bases and maple feet.\nWe conduct our wholesale business for Liberator sexual wellness products through four primary channels: (1) adult and female friendly retailers and specialty boutiques, (2) e-tailers who sell our products through adult, mass market, drug and other sites offering sexual wellness products, and (3) wholesale distributors of adult / sexual wellness products. These wholesale accounts have approximately 1,000 retail locations and/or websites in the United States and Canada. We have a growing number of retailers who have added a dedicated Liberator exhibition concept to their merchandising space. We also sell our products in Europe through a Germany based exclusive distributor.\nJaxx Casual Seating\nThe Company manufactures a line of contemporary casual indoor and outdoor seating under the Jaxx\u00ae brand. Jaxx bean bags are an offshoot from Liberator manufacturing as it provides additional revenue from repurposing our polyurethane foam trim into shredded bean bag fill.\nThe Jaxx indoor beanbag collection includes an offering of adult and children size beanbags in a variety of fabrics, faux-furs and vinyl. The Jaxx product line also includes solid foam indoor furniture collections and outdoor furniture collections that use polystyrene bead filling. The Jaxx product line and accessory products are sold through the following wholesale channels: (1) modern furniture e-tailers, (2) mass marketers, (3) interior designers, (4) schools and daycare centers, and (5) retail furniture stores. We also offer Jaxx private label and custom designs for large regional and national furniture chains. The Company also owns and manages a website under the URLs www.JaxxBeanBags.com and www.JaxxLiving.com for direct-to-consumer sales of Jaxx products.\nAvana\u00ae Top-of-Bed Comfort Products\nThe Company sells a unique collection of comfort products that aid in sleep, meditation, and relaxation under the Avana\u00ae brand. These products include a diverse offering of top-of-bed support cushions and props, many of which are assistive in relieving medical conditions associated with acid reflux, surgery recovery, and chronic pain.\nThe Avana product line is sold through e-merchants (including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, medical product distributors and specialty e-tailers) and through our website under the URL www.AvanaComfort.com. We believe that our Avana products compete effectively on the basis of good design, through offering a wide-range of designer colors and fabrics and supported by thousands of 5-star product reviews.\nProducts Purchased for Resale\nWe import high-quality pleasure objects from around the world for sale on our direct-to-consumer website Liberator.com.\nSales and Distribution\nOur sales management team is organized by market channel and by customer type. We have sales personnel who routinely visit sexual wellness retailers to assist in product training, merchandising and stocking of selling areas. Through our in-house wholesale sales organization, we engage e-merchants and retailers directly and then either ship to them on a wholesale basis or provide fulfillment services by drop-shipping directly to their customers. In international markets, the Company has a direct sales model with a US-based salesperson. This salesperson is responsible for wholesale sales, marketing operations and customer service in Canada and the European Union and other international markets. For European customers, orders are filled from our exclusive Germany-based distributor or directly from our facilities in Atlanta.\nAs is customary in the sexual wellness and casual furniture industry, sales to customers are generally made pursuant to purchase orders, and we do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with any of our retail customers or wholesale distributors. We believe that our continuing relationships with our customers are based upon our ability to provide a wide selection and reliable source of sexual wellness and casual furniture products, combined with our expertise in marketing and new product introduction.\nInternet Websites\nWe design and operate our websites using in-house development teams and our creative group using all media and social platforms to promote visibility and sales conversions. We also maintain a B-to-B website allowing wholesalers to both place orders and track delivery schedules.\nLiberator.com is promoted as a direct B-to-C website, and entertainment and educational venue, where consumers can watch product demonstration videos, peruse ezine blog content on sexual wellness topics, and watch non-pornographic videos on the many facets of human sexuality and erotic expression.\nJaxxbeanbags.com offers a collection of contemporary indoor and outdoor fashion seating, daybeds, childrens play couches and modular Panelist wall mounted headboards.\nAvanaComfort.com presents our collection of top-of-bed comfort products, specialty pillows and mattress elevators proven effective in controlling reflux and GERD symptoms during sleep.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe obtain all of the raw materials and component parts used to produce our products from outside sources. A number of components, including certain fabrics and polyurethane foam are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as our sole or primary source of supply. We believe we can obtain these raw materials and components from other sources of supply, although we could experience some short-term disruption in our ability to fulfill orders in the event of an unexpected loss of supply from one of the primary suppliers. We utilize dual sourcing on most fabrics and components when effective.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States from China, have increased the costs of certain raw materials, parts or components used in our products. Such an increase may materially and adversely affect our sales and our business, as we may increase the selling prices of our products. If any increase in costs of goods cannot be passed on to our customers, our business and gross profit may be materially and adversely affected.\nMajor Customers\nSales to (and through) Amazon accounted for 36% of our net sales during the year ended June 30, 2023 and 31% of our sales for the year ended June 30, 2022. The loss of, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with, any of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nCompetition\nWe compete with other marketers of sexual wellness, lifestyle and casual seating products both within and outside the U.S. The sexual wellness, bean bag and comfort products are highly fragmented and competition for the sale of such products comes from many types of e-tailers and retailers across diverse channels.\nFor Liberator products, we believe that our primary competitive advantage is consumer recognition of our iconic brand. Due to the strength of our brand, we have limited direct competition for the majority of our Liberator branded products. In fact, many e-commerce websites refer to Liberator as a product category and not as a generic sex furniture listing. And since we sell through multiple sales channels, we provide consumers with the ability to shop for Liberator intimacy products in an environment or website that they are most comfortable in. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves from conventional sexual wellness products based on our utility of design and overall customer satisfaction as it relates to enhanced intimacy.\nFor Jaxx and Avana products, we believe our primary competitive advantage is good designs, our offering of a wide range of designer colors and fabrics, good price to value, and our positive consumer reviews.\nFor our pleasure products purchased for Resale, competition among retailers of adult products and web-based marketers is high. Although we compete with retail and internet businesses and now mass and drug retailers that sell sexual wellness products including vibrators, pleasure objects, accessories and similar merchandise, we believe that this opens new channels of distribution for our Liberator products and that we are able to compete favorably as our Liberator products are unique, are couple-centric, and are assistive devices for couples with sexual limitations and issues.\nFor the Liberator e-commerce website, other competitive factors include the effectiveness of our electronic customer mailing lists, maintaining natural search listing, advertising response rates, website design and functionality. The broad range of designs, color choice, fabrics and accessories that we offer helps to differentiate us and allows us to compete favorably against many other adult or sexual wellness websites. Liberator.com also competes against numerous mainstream websites, many of which have a greater volume of web traffic, greater financial strength and marketing resources.\nWe believe competition in our industries is based on, among other things, the ability to deliver the right product at the right time, product quality and safety, innovation, customer service and price. We believe we compete favorably with other companies because of our ability to provide a broad product offering for customers, our vertically integrated manufacturing operation which allows us to quickly respond to customer demand, our commitment to quality and safety, and our commitment to minimizing our environmental impact.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to customs, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Liberator trademark is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we were issued approximately 20 other product name trademarks and trade names including: Bedroom Adventure Gear\u00ae, Ramp\u00ae, Wedge\u00ae, Stage\u00ae, Esse\u00ae, Zeppelin\u00ae, Hipster\u00ae, Wing\u00ae, Equus\u00ae, Jaxx\u00ae, Avana\u00ae, and Bonbon\u00ae. In August 2005, we were issued utility patent number US 6,925,669 Support Cushion and System of Cushions. We believe our trademarks and patent have significant value and we intend to continue to vigorously protect them against infringement.\nHuman Capital and Resources\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had 207 employees. The Companys employment levels may change seasonally based on current and anticipated order levels. Additional staffing is typically required to support the peak holiday period through Valentines Day. None of our employees are represented by a union. We have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relationships with our employees are good. Human capital management is critical to our ongoing business success, which requires investing in our people. Our aim is to create a highly engaged and motivated workforce where employees are inspired by leadership, engaged in purpose-driven, meaningful work and have opportunities for growth and development. We are committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated with respect and dignity. We value our diverse employees and provide career and professional development opportunities that foster the success of our company. An effective approach to human capital management requires that we invest in talent, development, culture and employee engagement. We aim to create an environment where our employees are encouraged to make positive contributions and fulfill their potential. We emphasize our core values of innovation, encouragement, motivation, and curiosity with our employees to instill our culture and create an environment of growth and positivity.\nAdditional information\nWe file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission). The Commission also maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the Commission.\nOther information about the Company can be found on our website www.luvubrands.com. Reference in this document to that website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operation. Although we have attempted to list comprehensively these important factors, we caution you that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nWe have been adversely affected by the effects of inflation and a potential recession.\nInflation has adversely affected our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for our products, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetition from other brands may hinder the development of our business.\nIncreased competitor consolidations, marketplace competition, and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our earnings, market share and volume growth. If, due to such pressure or other competitive threats, we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our sales, we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our sales revenues, we intend to introduce additional products. We may not be successful in doing this, or it may take us longer than anticipated to achieve market acceptance of these new products, if at all. Other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term. Competition, particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours, could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets, as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.\nOur reliance on logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms and retailers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably promote, sell, distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products, and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas, is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms and retailers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors and retailers promote, sell and distribute competing products, and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of our distribution network depends on the performance of the logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms and retailers in our network. There is a risk they may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected by competition from other companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors and retailers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, such third parties financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sales activities.\nWe will be dependent on our suppliers and do not have supply agreements with our suppliers. Events adversely affecting our suppliers, manufacturers and contractors would adversely affect us.\nIf we experience significant increased sales, and since we do not have supply agreements to ensure our requirements, there can be no assurance that additional products will be available when required or on terms that are favorable to us, or that a supplier would allocate sufficient products to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner which could lead to delays to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers, result in negative publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\nWe intend to maintain a full supply chain for the provision of our products. Suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors may elect, at any time, to decline or withdraw services necessary for our operations. Loss of these suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, any significant interruption, negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain or increase in the prices for the production of our products provided by any such third-party suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any inability to secure required supplies or to do so on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. ITEM 2. Properties.\nWe are headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia as 2745 Bankers Industrial Drive, Atlanta, GA 30360.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]. ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of the Company during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. Certain information contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words like expects, assumes, projects, anticipates, estimates, we believe, could be and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on managements expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in this section because of various factors, including those set forth elsewhere herein. See Forward-Looking Statements included in this report.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, expressed as a percentage of net sales. The discussion that follows the table should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2022\nNet sales\n100 %\n100 %\nCost of goods sold\n75 %\n77 %\nGross profit\n25 %\n23 %\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n20 %\n19 %\nOperating income\n5 %\n4 %\nFiscal Year ended June 30, 2023 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\nNet sales. The net sales increase of 11% in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 consists of a 48% increase in sales of Liberator products, offset, in part, by a 16% decrease in Jaxx products, a 23% decrease in sales of Avana products and 28% decrease in products purchased for resale. Sales of Liberator products increased 48% from the prior year to approximately $17.8 million during fiscal 2023. Sales of Jaxx products decreased 16% during fiscal 2023 to approximately $6.9 million. Sales of Avana products decreased 23% to $2.2 million during fiscal 2023. Sales of all products through the Wholesale sales channel in fiscal 2023 increased 9% from the prior year while the Direct sales channel increased approximately 16% from the prior year. The Wholesale sales channel includes branded products and resale products sold to brick-and-mortar retailers and e-merchants including, but not limited to, Amazon, Overstock and Wayfair. The Wholesale sales channel also includes contract manufacturing services which consists of specialty items that are manufactured in small quantities for certain customers, and which, to date, has not been a material part of our business. The Direct sales channel consists of consumer sales through our three websites. The increase in sales through the Direct channel was due to higher sales of products sold through our websites.\nGross profit. Gross profit, derived from net sales less the cost of product sales, includes the cost of materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead and depreciation. Total gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to 25% from 23% in the prior year. Gross profit dollars increased to $7,192,000 from $6,001,000 in the prior year and represented a 21% increase. The Company also continued to implement cost reduction strategies like transitioning the sewing of certain high-volume Jaxx and Avana products to a contract facility in Mexico which, during fiscal 2023, produced approximately 30% of our sewn products and reduced our total cost of production for those products.\nOperating expenses. Excluding depreciation expense, total operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 were 18% of net sales, or $5,294,000, compared to 18% of net sales, or $4,749,000, for the year ended June 30, 2022. The 11% increase in operating expenses from the prior year was primarily due to higher advertising and promotion expenses which were incurred in an effort to increase sales, higher occupancy costs, and higher personnel related costs.\nOther income (expense). Other expense decreased to ($262,000) from expense of ($342,000) in the prior fiscal year.\nNet income. We had a net income from operations of $1,282,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared with net income from operations of $604,000 or $0.01 per diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2022 due to increase in net sales and improvement in gross profit margin, partially offset by increase in operating expenses.\nFinancial Information about Our Business Sales Channels\nWe conduct our business through two primary sales channels: Direct (consisting of our Internet websites) and Wholesale (consisting of our stocking reseller, drop-ship, contract manufacturing and distributor accounts). During our last two years, substantially all of our revenue was generated within North America, and all of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. The following is a summary of our revenues:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nDirect\n$ 8,255\n$ 7,136\nWholesale\n20,260\n18,546\nOther\nTotal Net Sales\n$ 29,219\n$ 26,343\nNet sales in the Other channel consists primarily of shipping and handling fees derived from our Direct business.\nDirect\nThe following is a summary of our Direct business net sales and the percentage relationship to total revenues:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nDirect sales channel net sales\n$ 8,255\n$ 7,136\nDirect net sales as a percentage of total revenues\n28 %\n27 %\nWholesale\nThe following is a summary of our net sales to Wholesale customers and the percentage relationship to total revenues:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nWholesale sales channel net sales\n$ 20,260\n$ 18,546\nWholesale net sales as a percentage of total revenues\n69 %\n70 %\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company has over 950 active wholesale accounts, most of which are located in the United States.\nSales by Product Type\nThe following table represents the dollars and percentage of net sales by product type:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2022\nNet sales:\nLiberator\n$ 17,744\n61 %\n$ 11,978\n45 %\nJaxx\n6,923\n24 %\n8,293\n32 %\nAvana\n2,219\n7 %\n2,893\n11 %\nProducts purchased for resale\n1,165\n4 %\n1,615\n6 %\nOther\n1,168\n4 %\n1,564\n6 %\nTotal Net Sales\n$ 29,219\n100 %\n$ 26,343\n100 %\nLiberator - Liberator products consist of items that are manufactured by us and are intended for sale in the sexual health and wellness market. Liberator products are sold to e-merchants, retailers and distributors as well as directly through our e-commerce site. Net sales of Liberator products increased 48% during the year ended June 30, 2023, from the comparable year earlier period. This increase is primarily related to higher sales through our e-commerce site, Liberator.com.\nJaxx - Jaxx products are contemporary seating products manufactured by us and sold under the Jaxx brand. Jaxx products are sold to e-merchants and retailers as well as directly through our e-commerce site. Net sales of Jaxx products decreased 16% during the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to lower sales of Jaxx indoor and outdoor products.\nAvana - The Avana product line is a unique collection of top-of-bed and comfort products that aid in sleep, meditation, and relaxation. Avana products are sold through e-merchants, mail order catalogers and through our e-commerce site. Net sales of Avana products decreased 23% during the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was due primarily to increased competition from lower priced products from China and other countries.\nProducts purchased for resale - Products purchased for resale are other branded products that we purchase from others at wholesale or distributor prices and resell through our sales channels to e-merchants, retailers, or through one of our e-commerce sites. Sales of these products decreased 28% during the year ended June 30, 2023 from the prior year, due to consumer demand shrinkage across the industry. Sales of these products is increasingly competitive and, as a result, the Company has elected to only offer a more curated selection of products that typically have a higher gross profit.\nOther - Other products include sales from contract manufacturing and fulfillment services. Net sales during the year ended June 30, 2023 decreased 25% from the prior year.\nVariability of Results\nWe have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in future periods. Operating results have fluctuated as a result of changes in sales levels to consumers and wholesalers, competition, the COVID-19 pandemic aftereffects, seasonality costs associated with new product introductions, and increases in raw material costs. In addition, future operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control such as raw material cost increases, labor cost increases resulting from the current labor shortage, foreign exchange fluctuation, changes in government regulations, and economic changes in the regions in which we operate and sell. A portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed and the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on forecasts of future sales. Therefore, if net sales are below expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to meaningfully adjust spending in certain areas, or the inability to adjust spending quickly enough, as in personnel and administrative costs, to compensate for a sales shortfall. We may also choose to increase spending in response to market conditions, and these decisions may have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows:\nYear ended June 30,\n(in thousands)\nCash flow data from continuing operations:\nCash provided by operating activities\n$ 661\n$ 387\nCash used in investing activities\n$ (115 )\n$ (52 )\nCash used in financing activities\n$ (364 )\n$ (453 )\nAs of June 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,041,310 compared to $858,870 in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of the net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, stock-based compensation, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the prior year due to the net income from operations, offset, in part, by an increase in inventory.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities in the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was primarily for production equipment purchases and software development work.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities in the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was primarily due to repayment of secured and unsecured notes payable and equipment notes payable offset in part by borrowings through unsecured notes payable.\nInflation\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2023, we experienced increases in various raw material costs and increases in labor costs. We believe these pricing pressures have not stabilized and will continue to increase throughout fiscal 2024, although there is no assurance this will occur. Inflation can harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or improve productivity enough to offset the effects of inflation in our cost base. Furthermore, if our customers reduce their levels of spending in response to increases in retail prices and/or we are unable to pass such cost increases to our customers, our revenues and our profit margins may decrease.\nCapital Resources\nWe expect total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be less than $150,000 and to be funded by equipment loans and, to a lesser extent, anticipated operating cash flows and borrowings under the line of credit with Advance Financial Corporation. This includes capital expenditures in support of our normal operations.\nIf our business plans and cost estimates are inaccurate and our operations require additional cash or if we deviate from our current plans, we could be required to seek additional debt financing for particular projects or for ongoing operational needs. This indebtedness could harm our business if we are unable to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms. In addition, any indebtedness we incur in the future could subject us to restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business. If we do not comply with such covenants, our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings, which in turn could restrict our operating flexibility and endanger our ability to continue operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not use off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties, nor do we use other forms of off-balance sheet arrangements. Accordingly, our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off-balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities. As of June 30, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nWe have entered into operating leases primarily for certain equipment and our facilities in the normal course of business. These arrangements are often referred to as a form of off-balance-sheet financing. Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of June 30, 2023 are detailed in the section entitled Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEffect of Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Estimates\nWe do not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 in this report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes. We have identified certain policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies require the application of significant judgment by our management. We base our estimates on our historical experience, industry standards, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An adverse effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions. Our critical accounting policies include those listed below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue based on the five-step model which includes: (1) identifying the contract with the customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Substantially all of our revenue is generated by fulfilling orders for the purchase of manufactured products and product purchased for resale to retailers, wholesalers, or direct to consumers via online channels, with each order considered to be a distinct performance obligation. These orders may be formal purchase orders, verbal phone orders, e-mail orders or orders received online. Shipping and handling activities for which we are responsible under the terms and conditions of the order are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill our promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized. The impact of this policy election is insignificant as it aligns with our current practice.\nRevenue is measured as the net amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilling a performance obligation. We have elected to exclude sales, use and similar taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. The impact of this policy election is insignificant, as it aligns with our current practice. The amount of consideration expected to be received and revenue recognized includes estimates of variable consideration, which includes costs for trade promotion programs, coupons, returns, and early payment discounts. Such estimates are calculated using historical averages adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions and experience. We review and update these estimates at the end of each reporting period and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. In assessing whether collection of consideration from a customer is probable, we consider the customer's ability and intent to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. Payment of invoices is due as specified in the underlying customer agreement, typically 30 days from the invoice date, which occurs on the date of transfer of control of the products to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the point in time that control of the ordered products is transferred to the customer. Generally, this occurs when the product is delivered, or in some cases, picked up from one of our distribution centers by the customer.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of current and past due receivable balances that may not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, the aging of accounts receivable and our history of bad debts. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the receivable balance under current conditions. However, significant deterioration in the financial condition of our customers, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, could materially change these expectations and an additional allowance may be required.\nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value on an item-by-item basis and establish reserves equal to all or a portion of the related inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered. This requires us to make estimates regarding the net realizable value of our inventory, including an assessment for excess and obsolete inventory. Once we establish an inventory reserve amount in a fiscal period, the reduced inventory value is maintained until the inventory is sold or otherwise disposed of. In evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on-hand, the estimated time required to sell such inventory, the foreseeable demand within a specified time horizon and current and expected market conditions. Based on this evaluation, we record adjustments to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory to its net realizable value. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer demand or other factors differ from expectations. Finished goods and goods in process include a provision for manufacturing overhead, including depreciation.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable. We have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period. If we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination. We expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets. At June 30, 2023, we carried a valuation allowance of $1.3 million against our net deferred tax assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. If estimated fair value is less than the book value, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.\nIn fiscal year 2022 and 2023, we did generate positive cash flows from operations. However, if our long-term future results do not continue to yield positive cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets, we would anticipate possible future impairments of those assets.\nConsiderable management judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows and other factors affecting the valuation of long-lived assets, including the operating and macroeconomic factors that may affect them. We use historical financial information, internal plans and projections and industry information in making such estimates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nYear ended June 30,\n(in thousands)\nNet income\n$ 1,199\n$ 604\nPlus interest expense, financing costs and income tax\nPlus depreciation and amortization expense\nPlus stock-based compensation expense\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,947\n$ 1,276\nAs used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest income, interest expense and financing costs, depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense. We have excluded the non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense as they do not reflect the cash-based operations of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not required by or defined under GAAP. The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, including the net income of the Company or net cash provided by operating activities.\nManagement recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the Companys net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not a substitute for or a measure of the Companys profitability or net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance and liquidity, and because it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense and loss on disposal of assets.

(the Company) as of June 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nWe did not identify any critical audit matters that need to be communicated.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022. Margate, Florida\nOctober 13, 2023\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nLuvu Brands, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Luvu Brands, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of inventory and inventory reserves\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements, the Company has inventories, net totaled to approximately $3.82 million as of June 30, 2022. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company establishes reserves for excess and obsolete inventory for each accounting period and records any potential adjustments needed for the reserves.\nAuditing managements estimates of the net realizable value of inventories, including inventory reserves was highly judgmental due to the degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the inventory reserves which are based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events, such as economic conditions, that may affect inventory.\nTo test the estimates for the net realizable value of inventories, including inventory reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of the inputs used in managements inventory reserve calculation and analyzing the reserve calculations to determine whether management identified any evidence of slow-moving inventory or any obsolescence due to existing and potential changes in marketability which may impact the reserves.\n/s/ Liggett & Webb, P.A.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2012.\nBoynton Beach, Florida\nOctober 12, 2022\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS\nLuvu Brands, Inc. (the Company or Luvu) was incorporated in the State of Florida on February 25, 1999. References to the Company in these notes include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, OneUp Innovations, Inc. (OneUp), and Foam Labs, Inc. (Foam Labs). All operations of the Company are currently conducted by OneUp Innovations, Inc.\nThe Company is an Atlanta, Georgia based designer, manufacturer and marketer of a portfolio of consumer lifestyle brands including: Liberator\u00ae, a brand category of iconic products for enhancing sexual performance; Avana\u00ae inclined bed therapy products, assistive in relieving medical conditions associated with acid reflux, surgery recovery and chronic pain; and Jaxx\u00ae, a diverse range of casual fashion daybeds, sofas and beanbags made from polyurethane foam and repurposed polyurethane foam trim. These products are sold through the Companys websites, online mass merchants and retail stores worldwide. Many of our products are offered flat-packed and either roll or vacuum compressed to save on shipping and reduce our carbon footprint.\nSales are generated through internet and print advertisements. We have a diversified customer base with only one customer accounting for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the current and prior fiscal year and no particular concentration of credit risk in one economic sector. Foreign operations and foreign net sales are not material.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, OneUp and Foam Labs. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates of: income taxes; tax valuation reserves; allowances for doubtful accounts; inventory valuation and reserves, share-based compensation; and useful lives for depreciation and amortization. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue based on the five-step model which includes: (1) identifying the contract with the customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. Substantially all of our revenue is generated by fulfilling orders for the purchase of manufactured products and product purchased for resale to retailers, wholesalers, or direct to consumers via online channels, with each order considered to be a distinct performance obligation. These orders may be formal purchase orders, verbal phone orders, e-mail orders or orders received online. Shipping and handling activities for which we are responsible under the terms and conditions of the order are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs. These activities are required to fulfill our promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized. The impact of this policy election is insignificant as it aligns with our current practice.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nRevenue is measured as the net amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilling a performance obligation. We have elected to exclude sales, use and similar taxes from the measurement of the transaction price. The impact of this policy election is insignificant, as it aligns with our current practice. The amount of consideration expected to be received and revenue recognized includes estimates of variable consideration, which includes costs for trade promotion programs, coupons, returns and early payment discounts. Such estimates are calculated using historical averages adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions and experience. We review and update these estimates at the end of each reporting period and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. In assessing whether collection of consideration from a customer is probable, we consider the customer's ability and intent to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. Payment of invoices is due as specified in the underlying customer agreement, typically 30 days from the invoice date, which occurs on the date of transfer of control of the products to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the point in time that control of the ordered products is transferred to the customer. Generally, this occurs when the product is delivered, or in some cases, picked up from one of our distribution centers by the customer.\nDeferred revenues\nDeferred revenues are recorded when the Company has received consideration (i.e. advance payment) before satisfying its performance obligations. Deferred revenues primarily relate to gift cards purchased, but not used, prior to the end of the fiscal period. Our total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was $18,654 and $18,118, respectively, and was included in Other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes raw material, labor, manufacturing overhead, and royalty expense.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe include fees earned on the shipment of our products to customers in sales and include costs incurred on the shipment of product to customers in costs of goods sold.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management's best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on historical experience, specifically identified nonpaying accounts and other currently available evidence. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly with a focus on significant individual past due balances over 90 days. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nThe following is a summary of Accounts Receivable as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\n(in thousands)\nAccounts receivable\n$ 1,107\n$ 1,114\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n(1 )\n(1 )\nAllowance for discounts and returns\n(55 )\n(6 )\nTotal accounts receivable, net\n$ 1,051\n$ 1,107\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nInventories and Allowance for Excess and Obsolete Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is defined as sales price less cost to dispose and a normal profit margin. Inventory costs include materials, labor, depreciation and overhead. The company establishes allowances for excess and obsolete inventory, based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events, such as economic conditions, that may affect inventory. The reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value may be adjusted in response to changing conditions.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash accounts with banks located in Georgia. The total cash balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per bank. The Company had cash balances on deposit at June 30, 2023 and 2022 that exceeded the balance insured by the FDIC by $880,083 and $717,316, respectively. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily located in North America and Europe.\nDuring 2023, we purchased 33% of total inventory purchases from one vendor.\nDuring 2022, we purchased 34% of total inventory purchases from one vendor.\nAs of June 30, 2023, two of the Companys customers represent 35% and 12% of the total accounts receivables, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, two of the Companys customers represent 21% and 13% of the total accounts receivable, respectively. Sales to (and through) Amazon accounted for 36% and 31% of our net sales during each of the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 respectively.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, our financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, and other long-term debt.\nThe fair values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values based on either their short maturity or current terms for similar instruments.\nThe Company measures the fair value of its assets and liabilities under the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 does not require any new fair value measurements, but its provisions apply to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement.\nASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 requires the Company to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\u00b7\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated inputs; and\n\u00b7\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or liabilities.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nThe valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nA. Market approach - Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nB. Income approach - Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts, including present value techniques, option-pricing models and excess earnings method.\nC. Cost approach - Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed in the period when the advertisements are first aired or distributed to the public. Prepaid advertising (included in prepaid expenses) was $0 at June 30, 2023 and $1,050 at June 30, 2022. Advertising expense for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $790,757 and $574,146, respectively. Which is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for new products are expensed as they are incurred. Expenses for new product development (included in general and administrative expense) totaled $134,624 for the year ended June 30, 2023 and $117,079 for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over estimated service lives for financial reporting purposes of 2-10 years.\nExpenditures for major renewals and betterments which extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When properties are disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized currently.\nOperating Leases\nOn November 2, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with its landlord on a new lease for the current facilities for six years and two months, beginning January 1, 2021. The new lease includes two months of rent abatement totaling $103,230. Under the new lease, the monthly rent on the facility is $51,615 with annual escalations of 3% with the final two months of rent at $61,605. In addition, the Company will pay the landlord a 2% property management fee. The rent expense for the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was $652,752 and $652,752 respectively. Which is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nUnder ASC 842, which was adopted July 1, 2019, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company elected not to recognize leases with a term less than one year on its balance sheet. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nIn accordance with the guidance in ASU 2016-02, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g. land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g. property taxes, insurance, etc.) Then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on fair values to the lease components and non-lease components. Although separation of lease and non-lease components is required, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. The lease component results in an operating right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense.\nUnder prior guidance ASC 840, rent expense and lease incentives from operating leases were recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between rent expense recognized and rental payments was recorded as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company also leases certain equipment under operating leases, as more fully described in NOTE 13 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nSales Channel Information\nWe have identified three reportable sales channels: Direct, Wholesale and Other. Direct includes product sales through our five e-commerce sites. Wholesale includes Liberator, Jaxx, and Avana branded products sold to distributors and retailers, purchased products sold to retailers, and private label items sold to other resellers. The Wholesale category also includes contract manufacturing services, which consists of specialty items that are manufactured in small quantities for certain customers, and which, to date, has not been a material part of our business. Other consists principally of shipping and handling fees and costs derived from our Direct business and fulfillment service fees.\nThe following is a summary of sales results for the Direct, Wholesale, and Other channels.\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2022\n%\nChange\n(in thousands)\nNet Sales by Channel:\nDirect\n$ 8,255\n$ 7,136\n16 %\nWholesale\n20,260\n18,546\n9 %\nOther\n6 %\nTotal Net Sales\n$ 29,219\n$ 26,343\n11 %\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 2.

Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.\nThe total potential dilutive securities as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nConvertible Preferred Stock\n4,300,000\n4,300,000\nStock options - 2015 Plan\n1,400,000\n1,975,000\nTotal\n5,700,000\n6,275,000\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable. We have recorded and continue to carry a valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets we have determined wont be utilized. At June 30, 2023, we has a deferred tax asset of $10 thousands we carried a valuation allowance of $1.1 million against our remaining net deferred tax assets.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. We measure the cost of each stock option and restricted stock award at its fair value on the grant date. Each award vests over the subsequent period during which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). The cost of each award is recognized as expense in the financial statements over the respective vesting period.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 3. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nWe follow FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, regarding impairment of our other long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment). Our policy is to assess our long-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of a long-lived asset.\nAssets to be disposed of and related liabilities would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Assets to be disposed of would be reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and would not be depreciated. There was no impairment as of June 30, 2023 or 2022.\nNOTE 4. INVENTORIES\nAll inventories are stated at the lower of cost (which approximates first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. The Companys inventories consist of the following components at June 30, 2023 and 2022:\n(in thousands)\nRaw materials\n$ 1,926\n$ 1,893\nWork in process\nFinished goods\n2,021\n1,660\nTotal inventories\n4,454\n3,993\nAllowance for inventory reserves\n(252 )\n(176 )\nTotal inventories, net of allowance\n$ 4,202\n$ 3,817\nNOTE 5.

LINE OF CREDIT\nThe Companys wholly owned subsidiary, OneUp and OneUps wholly owned subsidiary, Foam Labs has entered into a credit facility with a finance company, Advance Financial Corporation dated May 24, 2011, as amended, to provide it with an asset based line of credit of up to $1,200,000 against 85% of eligible accounts receivable (as defined in the agreement) for the purpose of improving working capital and includes an Inventory Advance (as defined in the agreement) of up to the lesser of $500,000 or 125% of the eligible accounts receivable loan. The term of the agreement was one year, renewable for additional one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the current financing period. The credit facility is secured by our accounts receivable and other rights to payment, general intangibles, inventory and equipment, and are subject to eligibility requirements for current accounts receivable. Advances under the agreement are currently charged interest at a rate of prime rate plus 2% over the lenders Index Rate. In addition, there is a Monthly Service Fee (as defined in the agreement) of currently 0.05 % per month.\nThe Companys President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Louis Friedman, has personally guaranteed the repayment of the facility. In addition, the Company has provided its corporate guarantee of the credit facility (see Note 14). On June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022, respectively the balance owed under this line of credit was $1,039,013 and $1,070,369.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nOptions\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company had the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan), which is stockholder-approved and under which 1,700,000 shares are reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan until that Plan terminates on August 31, 2025.\nUnder the 2015 Plan, eligible employees and certain independent consultants may be granted options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The shares issuable under the 2015 Plan will either be shares of the Companys authorized but previously unissued common stock or shares reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased on the open market. As of June 30, 2023, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan was 300,000.\nA summary of option activity under the Companys stock plan for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is presented below:\nOption Activity\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at June 30, 2021\n2,500,000\n$ 0.04\n1.9 years\n$ 974,300\nGranted\n900,000\n$ 0.18\n4.8 years\nExercised\n(1,175,000 )\n$ 0.03\nForfeited or Expired\n(250,000 )\n$ 0.03\nOutstanding at June 30, 2022\n1,975,000\n$ 0.10\n3.0 years\n$ 107,500\nGranted\n-\n$ -\nExercised\n(525,000 )\n$ 0.03\nForfeited or Expired\n(50,000 )\n$ 0.03\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023\n1,400,000\n$ 0.14\n3.0 years\n$ 29,000\nExercisable at June 30, 2023\n487,500\n$ 0.09\n2.7 years\n$ 1,250\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is before applicable income taxes and represents the excess amount over the exercise price optionees would have received if all options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated, based on the Companys closing stock price of $0.10, $0.14, and $0.43 at June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThere were no stock options granted during the year ended June 30, 2023 and 900,000 stock options granted during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 the Companys proceeds from stock options exercise under 2015 Plan were $2,100 and $3,000 respectively.\nThe range of fair value assumptions related to options granted during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nExercise Price:\n$ -\n$ 0.16 - $0.30\nVolatility:\n-\n500% - 519%\nRisk Free Rate:\n-\n0.65% - 2.90%\nVesting Period:\n-\n4 years\nForfeiture Rate:\n-\n0%\nExpected Life:\n-\n4.1 years\nDividend Rate:\n-\n0%\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 15.

We measure the cost of each stock option and at its fair value on the grant date. Each award vests over the subsequent period during which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). The cost of each award is recognized as expense in the financial statements over the respective vesting period.\nAll stock option grants made under the Plan were at exercise prices no less than the Companys closing stock price on the date of grant. Options under the Plan were determined by the board of directors in accordance with the provisions of the plan. The terms of each option grant include vesting, exercise, and other conditions are set forth in a Stock Option Agreement evidencing each grant. No option can have a life in excess of ten (10) years. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The model requires various assumptions, including a risk-free interest rate, the expected term of the options, the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, and the expected dividend yield. Compensation expense for employee stock options is recognized ratably over the vesting term. The Company has no awards with market or performance conditions.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest.\nAs of June 30, 2023, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to all unvested stock options was $117,125 which is expected to be expensed over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.\nIn determining the grant date fair value of option awards under the equity incentive plans, the Company applied the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Based upon limited option exercise history, the Company has generally used the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 to estimate the expected life of stock option grants. Management believes that the historical volatility of the Companys stock price on OTCQB best represents the expected volatility over the estimated life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based upon published U.S. Treasury yield curve rates at the date of grant corresponding to the expected life of the stock option. An assumed dividend yield of zero reflects the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no intentions to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 15.

Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of common stock and has a liquidation preference of $0.2325 ($1,000,000 in the aggregate). Liquidation payments to the preferred holders have priority and are made in preference to any payments to the holders of common stock. In addition, each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the result of: (i) the number of shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding at the time of such vote multiplied by 1.01; divided by (ii) the total number of Series A Convertible Preferred Shares issued and outstanding at the time of such vote. At each meeting of shareholders of the Company with respect to any and all matters presented to the shareholders of the Company for their action or consideration, including the election of directors, holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Shares shall vote together with the holders of common shares as a single class.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNOTE 16. INCOME TAXES\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are computed by applying the effective U.S. federal income tax rate to the gross amounts of temporary differences and other tax attributes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to state income taxes are not material. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company believed it was more likely than not that future tax benefits from all future net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets would not be realizable through generation of future taxable income; therefore, they were partially reserved.\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 2023 and 2022 are approximately as follows:\nDeferred tax assets:\nInventory reserves\n$ 65\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nStock-based compensation\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\n1,041\n1,233\nTotal gross deferred tax assets\n1,152\n1,387\nValuation allowance\n(1,059)\n(1,387 )\nBook to tax depreciation difference - Liability\n(83\n)\n-\nNet deferred tax assets\n$ 10\n$ -\nThe income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal and state income tax rates of 25% to pretax (income) loss from operations for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 due to the following:\nTax expense\n$ 306\n$ 156\nPermanent differences and change in tax rate estimate\n-\nValuation (allowance)\n(317 )\n(156 )\nNet tax benefit\n$ (10)\n$ -\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $4.0 million that may be offset against future taxable income. During 2023 and 2022, the total change in the valuation allowance was approximately $317,000 and $156,000, respectively. The majority of the Companys NOLSbegin to expire in the year 2030.\nLuvu Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe tax years that remain subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions are those for the years ended June 30, 2013 through 2023. The Company has not filed its Federal or State tax returns for 2017 through 2022 but expects to file these returns before the end of calendar year 2023.\nNOTE 17. - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn July 28, 2023 a promissory note dated July 29, 2021 for the amount of $100,000 with an interest rate of 13.5% paid monthly, with the principal due in full on July 31, 2023, was amended and extended with a new promissory note with an interest rate of 13.5%, with the principal due in full on July 31, 2025. Mr. Friedman has personally guaranteed the repayment of the loan obligation. ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere are no events required to be disclosed under this Item. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain certain disclosure controls and procedures as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They are designed to help ensure that material information is: (1) gathered and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding required disclosures; and (2) recorded, processed, summarized, reported and filed with the SEC as required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and within the time periods specified by the SEC.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2023. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 due to the material weakness below. To address these material weakness, management performed additional procedures to ensure the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\n(b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. For this purpose, internal control over financial reporting refers to a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCOAB) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weakness - Management failed to perform a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 based upon criteria in an Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) or alternative framework.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept as set forth above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

While the Company does not have a policy regarding diversity of its board members, diversity is one of a number of factors that will be taken into account in identifying board nominees.\nDirectors Compensation\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, our directors did not receive any compensation in their capacity as a director.\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership, and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common shares and other equity securities on Forms 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based on a review of the copies of such forms received by us, and to the best of our knowledge, there were no reports untimely filed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nCode of Ethics\nDuring August 2023 we adopted a code of ethics. The code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K annual report. The code applies to our officers, director, employees, and certain consultants. The code provides written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and promote: (i) honest and ethical conduct; (ii) full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure; (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) promote reporting of internal violations of the code; and (v) accountability for the adherence to the code. A copy of our code of ethics may, upon request made to us in writing at the following address, be made available without charge: 2745 Bankers Industrial Drive, Atlanta, Georgia, 30360. ITEM 11.

The options shall immediately vest upon the Company uplisting to a national exchange or in the event of a change of control of the Company, as defined under the Stock Option Agreement. The option is exercisable for a period of 5 years from the initial grant date. ITEM 12.

In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 12, 2023, are deemed outstanding. Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
