    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nOverview\nDigerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (including our subsidiaries, we, us, Company or Digerati), through its operating subsidiaries in Texas, Florida, and California that includes Shift8 Networks, Inc., dba, T3 Communications (a Texas entity), T3 Communications, Inc. (a Florida entity) (with both T3 in Florida and T3 in Texas being referred to herein, collectively, as T3), Nexogy Inc. (a Florida entity), and NextLevel Internet, Inc. (a California entity), provides cloud services specializing in Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) and broadband connectivity solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud WAN solutions (SD WAN). We provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, video conferencing, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud\u2122. Our broadband connectivity solutions for the delivery of digital oxygen are designed for reliability, business continuity and to optimize bandwidth for businesses using the Companys cloud communication services and other cloud-based applications.\nAs a provider of cloud communications solutions to the SMB, we are seeking to capitalize on the migration by businesses from the legacy telephone network to the Internet Protocol (IP) telecommunication network and the migration from hardware-based on-premise telephone systems to software-based communication systems in the cloud. Most SMBs are lagging in technical capabilities and advancement and seldom reach the economies of scale that their larger counterparts enjoy, due to their achievement of a critical mass and ability to deploy a single solution to a large number of workers. SMBs are typically unable to afford comprehensive enterprise solutions and, therefore, need to integrate a combination of business solutions to meet their needs. Cloud computing has revolutionized the industry and opened the door for businesses of all sizes to gain access to enterprise applications with affordable pricing. This especially holds true for cloud telephony applications, but SMBs are still a higher-touch sale that requires customer support for system integration, network installation, cabling, and troubleshooting. We have placed a significant emphasis on that local touch when selling, delivering, and supporting our services which we believe differentiate us from the national providers that are experiencing high attrition rates due to poor customer support.\nThe adoption of cloud communication services is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, including the increasing costs of maintaining installed legacy communications systems, the fragmentation resulting from use of multiple on-premise systems, and the proliferation of personal smartphones used in the workplace. Today, businesses are increasingly looking for an affordable path to modernizing their communications system to improve productivity, business performance and customer experience. Modernization has also led to businesses adopting other cloud-based business applications, including CRM, payroll, and accounting software, placing an even more important emphasis on reliable Internet connectivity.\nOur cloud solutions offer the SMB reliable, robust, and full-featured services at affordable monthly rates that eliminates high-cost capital expenditures and provides for integration with other cloud-based systems. By providing a variety of comprehensive and scalable solutions, we can cater to businesses of different sizes on a monthly subscription basis, regardless of the stage of development for the business.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisitions\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of Next Level Internet, Inc. (NextLevel). NextLevel, based in San Diego, California, is engaged in the business of providing cloud communications, Unified Communications as a Service, collaboration, contact center, managed broadband connectivity and other voice and data services to the SMB market. The acquisition of NextLevel expands the Companys growing nationwide footprint and adds a strong West Coast presence with nearly 1,000 SMB clients in California.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Skynet Telecom LLC (Skynet), a Texas-based provider of VoIP communication services, UCaaS, and broadband connectivity services to the SMB market. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired the customer base, certain equipment, certain intellectual property, inventory, contract rights, software and other licenses, and miscellaneous assets used in connection with the operation of Skynets telecommunications business.\nOn November 17, 2020, the Company closed on the acquisitions of Nexogy, Inc. (Nexogy), and the assets of ActiveServe, Inc., a Florida corporation that constitute the ActivePBX business (ActivePBX), leading providers of cloud communication, UCaaS, and broadband solutions tailored for businesses.\nAs a combined business, NextLevel, Skynet, Nexogy, ActivePBX, and T3, serve over 4,000 business customers and approximately 45,000 business users. The business model of the combined entities is supported by strong and predictable recurring revenue with high gross margins under contracts with business customers in various industries including banking, healthcare, financial services, legal, insurance, hotels, real estate, staffing, municipalities, food services, and education. We expect the acquisitions to have a positive impact on the revenues and operating income of the Company during the fiscal year that will end on July 31, 2023, due to the anticipated cost synergies and consolidation savings.\nMEOA Business Combination\nOn August 30, 2022, Digerati entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Business Combination Agreement), by and among Digerati, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation (MEOA), and Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MEOA (Merger Sub).\nThe Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the board of directors of each of MEOA and Digerati.\nThe Business Combination Agreement provides, among other things, that Merger Sub will merge with and into Digerati, with Digerati as the surviving company in the merger and, after giving effect to such merger, Digerati shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of MEOA (the Merger). In addition, MEOA will be renamed Digerati Holdings, Inc. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the Business Combination. Other capitalized terms used, but not defined, herein, shall have the respective meanings given to such terms in the Business Combination Agreement.\nIn accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the Effective Time, among other things: (i) each share of Digerati common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for shares of MEOA common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (each, an MEOA Share and collectively, the MEOA Shares), based upon the exchange ratio set forth in the Business Combination Agreement (the Exchange Ratio); (ii) all vested and unvested stock options of Digerati will be assumed by MEOA and thereafter be settled or exercisable for MEOA Shares, as applicable, determined based on the Exchange Ratio; (iii) each warrant to purchase shares of Digerati common stock will be canceled in exchange for a warrant to purchase MEOA Shares determined based on the Exchange Ratio; (iv) any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock of Digerati outstanding as of the Effective Time will thereafter be convertible into a number of MEOA Shares determined by multiplying the number of shares of Digerati common stock into which such preferred shares would have been convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio; (v) certain convertible notes of Digerati issued following the signing of the Business Combination Agreement and outstanding as of the Effective Time will thereafter be convertible into a number of MEOA Shares determined by multiplying the number of shares of Digerati common stock into which such convertible notes would have been convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio; and (vi) each share of MEOA Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the MEOA Class A Common Stock), and each share of MEOA Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the MEOA Class B Common Stock), that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become one MEOA Share following the consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe Business Combination is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2023, following the receipt of the required approval by the stockholders of MEOA and Digerati, approval by the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) of MEOAs initial listing application filed in connection with the Business Combination, and the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.\nProducts and Services\nWe provide a comprehensive suite of cloud services specializing in UCaaS solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network) solutions. We provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the SMB at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, video conferencing, mobile applications, VoIP transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud\u2122. Our broadband connectivity solutions for the delivery of digital oxygen are designed for reliability, business continuity and to optimize bandwidth for businesses using the Companys cloud communication services and other cloud-based applications.\nVoice over Internet Protocol Networks\nThe basic technology of traditional telecommunications systems was designed for slow mechanical switches. Communications over the traditional telephone network are routed through circuits that must dedicate all circuit resources to each call from its inception until the call ends, regardless of whether anyone is actually talking on the circuit. This circuit-switching technology incurs a significant cost per call and does not efficiently support the integration of voice with data services. Data networks, however, were designed for electronic switching. They break the data stream into small, individually addressed packages of data (packets) that are routed independently of each other from the origin to the destination. Therefore, they do not require a fixed amount of bandwidth to be reserved between the origin and destination of each call and they do not waste bandwidth when it is not being used for actual transmission of information. This allows multiple voice or voice and data calls to be pooled, resulting in these networks being able to carry more calls with an equal amount of bandwidth. Moreover, they do not require the same complex switching methods required by traditional voice telephone networks, instead using a multiplicity of routers to direct each packet to its destination and automatically routing packets around blockages, congestion, or outages.\nPacket switching can be used within a data network or across networks, including the public Internet. The Internet itself is not a single data network owned by any single entity, but rather a loose interconnection of networks belonging to many owners that communicate using the Internet Protocol. By converting voice signals to digital data and handling the voice signals as data, it can be transmitted through the more efficient switching networks designed for data transmissions and through the Internet using the Internet Protocol. The transmission of voice signals as digitalized data streams over the Internet is known as VoIP. A VoIP network has the following advantages over traditional networks:\n\u25cf Simplification: An integrated infrastructure that supports all forms of communication allows more standardization, a smaller equipment complement, and less equipment management.\n\u25cf Network Efficiency: The integration of voice and data fills up the data communication channels efficiently, thus providing bandwidth consolidation and reduction of the costs associated with idle bandwidth. This combined infrastructure can support dynamic bandwidth optimization and a fault tolerant design. The differences between the traffic patterns of voice and data offer further opportunities for significant efficiency improvements.\n\u25cf Co-existence with traditional communication mediums: IP telephony can be used in conjunction with existing public telephone system switches, leased and dial-up lines, PBXs and other customer premise equipment, enterprise LANs, and Internet connections. IP telephony applications can be implemented through dedicated gateways, which in turn can be based on open standards platforms for reliability and scalability.\n\u25cf Cost reduction: Under the VoIP network, the connection is directly to the Internet backbone and as a result the telephony access charges, and settlement fees are avoided.\nThe growth of voice over the Internet was limited in the past due to poor sound quality caused by technical issues such as delays in packet transmission and by bandwidth limitations related to Internet network capacity and local access constraints. However, the expansion of Internet Protocol network infrastructure, improvements in packet switching and compression technology, new software algorithms and improved hardware have substantially reduced delays in packet transmissions and resulted in superior sound quality to that of the legacy telephone network. The continued improvement and expansion of the Internet Protocol network has resulted in the use of this technology for other communication media, including video conferencing and instant messaging.\nCloud Communications\nCloud communications are Internet-based voice and data communications where telecommunications applications, switching and storage are hosted by a third-party service provider outside of the organization using the services. Services are accessed by the user over the public Internet. Cloud telephony refers specifically to voice services and more specifically the replacement of conventional business telephone equipment (such as a PBX) with VoIP service hosted by a third-party service provider and delivered over the Internet.\nWe operate a cloud communication network that consists of a VoIP switching system and cloud telephony application platform. Our network allows us to provide end-to-end cloud telephony solutions designed to provide significant benefits to businesses of all sizes, with single or multiple locations. The integration of our cloud communication platform and global VoIP network allows us to provide our customers with virtually any type of telephony solution, including video conferencing, on a global basis.\nOur cloud communication solutions, also known as UCaaS, are designed to minimize upfront capital costs, increase the scalability and flexibility of the customers communications network and service environment, provide robust features and functionality to increase productivity and reduce the overall cost of communications.\nBroadband Connectivity\nBroadband connectivity or Internet access is the ability of individuals and organizations to connect to the Internet using computer terminals, computers, and other devices and to access services or applications hosted on the Internet or in the cloud. Internet service providers (ISPs) deliver connectivity at a wide range of data transfer rates using various networking technologies.\nWe operate as an ISP in California and Florida through a broadband network engineered and built to deliver broadband solutions to our customers in the regional markets served by the Company. The Companys broadband network utilizes various network technologies, including fiber and wireless technology. Our Internet Protocol (IP) layer of the ISP network incorporates SD WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network) technology for optimization of bandwidth and business continuity. The Company also deploys mobile broadband solutions to serve as a diverse network back-up for Internet connectivity.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to target the small to medium-sized business market and capitalize on the wave of migration from the legacy telephone network to cloud telephony. We will continue to concentrate our sales and marketing efforts on developing vertically oriented solutions for targeted markets primarily focusing on municipalities, banking, healthcare, legal services, and real estate. In addition, we will continue to partner with our distributors and Value-Added Resellers (VARs) to expand our customer base. Our typical VAR, also referred to as a Partner, is an information technology services firm, traditional PBX vendor, managed service provider, or systems integrator that has established relationships with businesses in its local market. These VARs are currently providing local customer support for other IT or PBX services but lack the technology infrastructure to provide cloud communication and VoIP services to their customers. Our strategy allows these VARs to focus on their strength of providing first tier support to their customers while we provide the second and third tier technical support required to operate a cloud communication and VoIP network. In addition, we transform our VARs business model by introducing new cloud telephony services and adding a new and lucrative recurring revenue stream that increases the VARs value proposition for its current and prospective customers.\nOur cloud-based technology platform enables us and our VARs to deliver enhanced voice services to their business customers. The features supported on our cloud communication platform include all standard telephone features and value-added applications such as voicemail to email, VoIP peering, teleconferencing, IVR auto attendant, and dial-by-name directory. Our system provides our customers and VARs with a migration path from a traditional PBX system to a complete cloud-based PBX solution.\nOur strategic initiatives to successfully meet our long-term business objectives include:\n\u25cf A continued emphasis on our UCaaS/cloud communication business, which operates in a segment of the telecommunications industry that continues to experience solid growth as businesses migrate from legacy phone systems to cloud-based telephony systems and implement hybrid \u2018stay at home teleworking environments.\n\u25cf Enhancements to our UCaaS solutions to include collaboration tools and integration with third-party systems that improves our business customers internal communication and engagement with underlying customers.\n\u25cf Continued enhancements to our broadband product portfolio and the delivery of digital oxygen to our business customers.\n\u25cf A disciplined approach to evaluating additional accretive acquisitions as we continue to target local and/or regional UCaaS/cloud telephony providers, which have excelled in their market with that local touch when serving their business customers. The Company will assimilate best practices from its acquisitions to optimize productivity and performance throughout the organization.\n\u25cf A continued focus on the U.S. market of SMBs, of which a significant portion has not yet migrated to a UCaaS or cloud communication solution.\n\u25cf A continued emphasis on the Companys channel strategy that enables its agents and Partners to offer cloud and session-based communication services to the business market, primarily the SMB.\n\u25cf Continued enhancement of our infrastructure and back-office systems to streamline operations and automate processes for efficiency, all which support both its organic and acquisition growth model.\n\u25cf Implementing a total support model (pre and post sales) for building a world-class service delivery and help desk organization.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe cloud services industry, including the provisioning of cloud communications services, cloud connectivity, cloud storage and cloud computing, as well as carrier voice and data services, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing by providers with similar products and services. We expect that new, smaller, but very agile competitors, specializing in providing service to regional and emerging markets at low margin and hence low cost, may have an impact on our market. Similarly, the business services market includes competitors who may be significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence, financial, technical, operational and marketing resources than we do, including Tier 1 carriers, cable companies and premise-based solutions providers that are implementing cloud communication services. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets where we compete with them, we may not be able to compete successfully in those markets. Specialized cloud services providers, who focus on one or more cloud service or application, could adopt aggressive pricing and promotion practices that could impact our ability to compete. We also believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect our gross margins if we are not able to reduce our costs commensurate with the price reductions of our competitors. In addition, the pace of technological change makes it impossible for us to predict whether we will face new competitors using different technologies to provide the same or similar services offered or proposed to be offered by us. If our competitors were to provide better and more cost-effective services than ours, we may not be able to increase our revenues or capture any significant market share.\nThe VoIP and Internet telephony market are highly competitive. Our competitors include major telecommunications carriers in the U.S., national UCaaS providers, and numerous small cloud telephony operators. We expect to face continuing competition based on price and service offerings from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future. The principal competitive factors in our market include price, coverage, customer service, technical response times, reliability, and network size/capacity. The competitive landscape is rapidly altering the number, identity, and competitiveness of the marketplace, and we are unable to determine with certainty the impact of potential consolidation in our industry.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality voice service over the Internet in a cost-effective manner, superior customers service and our VAR distribution model. We cannot provide assurances, however, that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a provider of Internet voice communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request, and complying with rules to mitigate Robocalls under the federal TRACED Act, FCCs STIR/SHAKEN protocols, and any response to Traceback requests from the FCCs industry consortium- Industry Traceback Group. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services. We are a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in Florida. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in these states. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement to register or seek certification to provide telephone services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions, and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements.\nThe effect of any future laws, regulations, and orders on our operations, including, but not limited to, our cloud-based communications and collaboration services, cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers, which could result in making our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if we increase our prices or decreasing our profit margins if we attempt to absorb such costs.\nFederal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. Increased regulation of the Internet may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulation of Internet-based Telecommunication Services in the United States\nWe have the necessary authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act to operate as a domestic and international telecommunications carrier. We are considered a non-dominant domestic interstate carrier subject to minimal regulation by the FCC. We are not required to obtain FCC authority to initiate or expand our domestic interstate operations, but we are required to obtain FCC approval to transfer control or discontinue service and are required to file various reports and pay various fees and assessments. In addition, we must offer service on a nondiscriminatory basis at just and reasonable rates and are subject to the FCCs complaint jurisdiction. Generally, our international voice traffic is subject to minimal regulation by state and local jurisdictions.\nAs a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in Florida. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in Florida. As a CLEC, we are generally required to register or seek certification to provide certain services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various consumer protection, reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection requirements.\nThe FCC requires Internet voice communications service providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wire-line E-911 network. Under the FCCs rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the callers phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point, or PSAP, for the callers registered location. The FCC also requires interconnected VoIP service providers to make Universal Service Fund (USF) contributions. We believe that our services are currently compliant with all applicable requirements of the FCC, and we have made and are making the required contributions to the USF. However, should we at some time fail to meet certain requirements or fail to make required contributions, we could be subject to revocation of our authority to operate or to fines or penalties.\nAs a result of the FCCs preemption of states ability to regulate certain aspects of VoIP service, and a trend in state legislatures to affirmatively deregulate VoIP services for most purposes, our VoIP services are subject to relatively few state regulatory requirements, aside from collection of state and local E911 fees and state Universal Service support obligations as well as some state communication service and sales taxes, when applicable. We believe that our VoIP services are currently compliant with all applicable state requirements, and we have made and are making the required contributions to E911, state USF, and other funds. The state regulatory framework for our VoIP services continues to evolve, so we, in conjunction with our professional advisors, monitor the actions of the various state regulatory agencies and endeavor to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable state law, including any new statutes or regulations that may be passed. However, there can be no assurance that we will become aware of all applicable requirements on a timely basis, or that we will always be fully compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Should we fail to be compliant with applicable state regulations, or to file required reports with state regulatory agencies, we could be subject to fines and/or penalties.\nIn addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet generally could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally.\nInternational Regulation\nThe regulatory treatment of Internet telephony outside of the U.S. varies widely from country to country. A number of countries that currently prohibit competition in the provision of voice telephony also prohibit Internet telephony. Other countries permit but regulate Internet telephony. Some countries will evaluate proposed Internet telephony service on a case-by-case basis and determine whether it should be regulated as a voice service or as another telecommunications service. In many countries, Internet telephony has not yet been addressed by legislation or regulation. Increased regulation of the Internet and/or Internet telephony providers or the prohibition of Internet telephony in one or more countries could adversely affect our business and future prospects if we decide to expand globally.\nFederal Robocall Mitigation Efforts and Regulations\nBeginning in March 2020, the FCC began to implement rules pursuant to the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act to mitigate illegal and fraudulent robocalls to consumer subscribers. The rules apply to all IP Enabled Communication Services operating in the U.S., including interconnected VoIP services like our services. The FCC also implemented a STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework be integrated by all VoIP services which requires certain identification processes in their Internet Protocol networks no later than June 30, 2022. We took action to implement STIR/SHAKEN in advance of the FCCs deadlines and are compliant with all applicable STIR/SHAKEN requirements and TRACED Act requirements. We have also registered and coordinated with the FCCs delegated industry consortium for tracking of robocalls through its Industry Traceback Group and stand ready should action be required. The FCC continues to adopt rules related to illegal robocalls, and we continue to monitor the FCC efforts as they further develop in order to ensure continued compliance with robocall mitigation rules.\nCustomers and Suppliers\nWe rely on various suppliers to provide services in connection with our VoIP and UCaaS offerings. Our customers include businesses in various industries including Healthcare, Banking, Financial Services, Legal, Real Estate, and Construction. We are not dependent upon any single supplier or customer.\nDuring the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not derive revenues of 10% or more from any single customer.\nAs of July 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have outstanding accounts receivable of 10% or more from any single customer.\nEmployees\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had 90 employees, all of whom performed sales, operational, technical, and administrative functions. We believe our future success will depend to a large extent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of these aforementioned employees belong to labor unions. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nNot Applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 1B.

(NextLevel). NextLevel, based in San Diego, California, is engaged in the business of providing cloud communications, Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS), collaboration, contact center, managed broadband connectivity and other voice and data services to the SMB market. The acquisition of NextLevel expands the Companys growing nationwide footprint and adds a strong West Coast presence with nearly 1,000 SMB clients in California.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Skynet Telecom LLC (Skynet), a Texas-based provider of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communication services, UCaaS, and broadband connectivity services to the SMB market.

(a Florida entity), Nexogy Inc., and NextLevel) collectively referred to as the Guarantors (T3 Nevada and the Guarantors, collectively, the Loan Parties), Post Road Administrative LLC (the Agent) and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LLP (collectively, with the Agent, Post Road), entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (Forbearance Agreement).\nThe Forbearance Agreement was entered into because certain events of default related to both the Credit Agreement (originally entered into in November 2020 and amended in December 2021 and February 2022) and the Joinder (entered into in February 2022) have occurred. The events of default related to financial covenants were failure to maintain a Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of less than 4.05 to 1.00 and failure to comply with a Credit Agreement provision whereby the Loan Parties are not allowed to make annual Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) greater than $379,190.\nOn October 17, 2022, and the Loan Parties and Post Road agreed to amend the Forbearance Agreement dated June 13, 2022, pursuant to an Amendment to Forbearance Agreement (the Amendment).\nThe Amendment was entered into because certain events of default related to both the Credit Agreement and the Joinder that had occurred prior to the parties entering into the Forbearance Agreement were continuing (the Prior Existing Defaults), certain additional events of default related to the Credit Agreement had occurred since the date of the Forbearance Agreement (the Additional Existing Defaults), and the parties anticipated that additional events of default with respect to the Credit Agreement will occur (the Anticipated Defaults).\nThe Additional Existing Defaults related to financial covenants were failure to maintain a Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of less than 4.06 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022, and failure to maintain Minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of $2.0 million for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022. The Anticipated Defaults related to financial covenants are failure to maintain a Senior Leverage Ratio of less than 4.05 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2022, and failure to maintain Minimum Liquidity of $2.0 million for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2022.\nThe Additional Existing Defaults and Anticipated Defaults unrelated to financial covenants relate to the Loan Parties failure to deliver a compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022, and ending October 31, 2022, respectively and, with respect to the Additional Existing Defaults, to timely deliver an executed copy of an amendment to a lease agreement.\nPursuant to the Amendment, Post Road agreed to forbear through the Amended Forbearance Period (as defined below) from (i) exercising its rights and remedies with regard to the Prior Existing Defaults, the Additional Existing Defaults, and the Anticipated Defaults and (ii) requiring compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement. The Amended Forbearance Period is from June 13, 2022, through the earlier of (a) November 15, 2022, (b) the date on which any other event of default not enumerated in the Amendment occurs or is deemed to have occurred, or (c) the date of any failure of any Loan Party to comply with any term, condition, or provision of the Forbearance Agreement as amended by the Amendment. The Amendment does not constitute a waiver of the defaults enumerated therein nor does it impair the ability of Post Road to exercise its rights and remedies after the expiration of the Amended Forbearance Period.\nThe events of default unrelated to financial covenants were the Loan Parties failure to: (a) deliver certain certificates, financial information and projections, lease, landlord, and control agreements, and evidence of a UCC-3 filing; (b) close or consolidate certain bank accounts; (c) provide ten (10) business days notice prior to the Company filing certain filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and the Nevada Secretary of State; and (d) engage an industry consultant acceptable to the Agent to consult with the Loan Parties on integration strategy, future acquisitions, operating performance, and various business issues.\nThe Company anticipates implementing remedies by November 15, 2022, to resolve the financial covenants breaches and the breaches regarding delivering a compliance certificate, financial projections, and a landlord agreement along with engaging an industry consultant. The Company and Post Road have agreed to work in good faith to adjust the financial covenants set forth in Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement to include the financial impact of the acquisition of Skynet and Next Level. As of the date of this filing, the Company cannot predict the final outcome of the negotiations with Post Road. For further information, please refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKey Performance indicators:\nEBITDA from operations, as adjusted is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as corporate expenses, transactional legal expenses, stock option expense, and depreciation and amortization, which are significant components in assessing the Companys financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDA from operations, as adjusted provides useful information regarding the Companys operations and other factors that affect the Companys reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as transactional legal fees and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its operations. As a result, users of the Companys consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the financial consolidated results of the Company across different periods\nThe following tables provide information regarding certain key performance indicators for Digerati for the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021. Management utilizes these metrics to track and forecast revenue trends and expected results from operations:\n(In thousands)\nFor the Years ended July 31,\nVariances %\nOPERATING REVENUES:\nCloud software and service revenue $ 24,154 $ 12,416 $ 11,738 95 %\nTotal operating revenues 24,154 12,416 11,738 95 %\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 9,346 5,135 4,211 82 %\nGROSS MARGIN 14,808 7,281 7,527 103 %\nGPM% 61.31 % 58.64 % 2.66 %\nEXPENSES:\nSelling, general and administrative expense 11,158 5,230 5,928 113 %\nBad debt expense 476 %\nTotal expenses 11,256 5,247 6,009 115 %\nEBITDA FROM OPERATIONS, as adjusted 3,552 2,034 1,518 75 %\nReconciliation to Operating loss, as reported\nOther Expenses\nCorporate expenses & stock compensation expenses 1,609 1,783 (174 ) -10 %\nCorporate legal, professional fees and transactional expenses 2,703 1,803 200 %\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2,916 1,749 1,167 67 %\nTotal other expenses 7,228 4,432 2,796 63 %\nOPERATING LOSS, as reported $ (3,676 ) $ (2,398 ) $ (1,278 ) 53 %\nOther Key Metrics\nTotal Customers 4,023 2,655 1,368 52 %\nCloud software and service revenue increased by $11,738,000, or 95% from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. In addition, our gross margin increased by $7,527,000 from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in revenue and gross margin between years is primarily attributed to the increase in total customers between years due to the acquisitions of Nexogy, ActivePBX, Skynet, and NextLevel.\nEBITDA from operations, as adjusted increased from $1,518,000, or 75% from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The primary reason for the improvement in EBITDA from operations is due to the increase in gross margin of $7,527,000 between the year ended July 31,2021 and 2022. The improvement in gross margin was offset by the increase in total operational expenses of $6,009,000 between the years ended July 31, 2021, and 2022. EBITDA from operations, as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nOur total customers increased from 2,655 during the year ended July 31, 2021, to 4,023 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in customers is attributed to the acquisitions and consolidation of Skynet and NextLevel during the year ended July 31, 2022. Going forward, absent further acquisitions, we expect a net increase in our number of customers of 1% to 5% each fiscal year.\nSources of revenue:\nCloud Software and Service Revenue: We provide UCaaS or cloud communication services and managed cloud-based solutions to small and medium size enterprise customers and to other resellers. Our Internet-based services include fully hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, auto attendant, voice and web conferencing, call recording, messaging, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment. Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), fiber, mobile broadband, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery.\nDirect Costs:\nCloud Software and Service: We incur bandwidth and colocation charges in connection with our UCaaS or cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connectivity between our customers to allow them access to our various services. We also incur costs from underlying providers for fiber, Internet broadband, and telecommunication circuits in connection with our data and connectivity solutions.\nResults of Operations\nCloud Software and Service Revenue. Cloud software and service revenue increased by $11,738,000, or 95% from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to the increase in total customers between years due to the acquisitions of Nexogy, ActivePBX, Skynet and NextLevel. Our total number of customers increased from 2,655 for the year ended July 31, 2021, to 4,023 customers for the year ended July 31, 2022. As part of the acquisitions, our primary emphasis is on integrating the secured customers base, consolidating products and services, retaining the monthly recuring revenue, and providing exceptional customer support.\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). The cost of services increased by $4,211,000, or 82% from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in cost of services is primarily attributed to the consolidation of various networks and key vendors as part of the increase in total customers between periods due to the acquisitions of Nexogy, ActivePBX, Skynet and NextLevel. Our total number of customers increased from 2,655 for the year ended July 31, 2021, to 4,023 customers for the year ended July 31, 2022. However, our consolidated gross margin improved by $7,527,000 from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. We are not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to cause a material change in the relationship between our costs and our revenues.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses (exclusive of legal and professional fees and stock compensation expense). SG&A expenses increased by $5,815,000, from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in SG&A is attributed to acquisition of Nexogy, ActivePBX, Skynet and NextLevel, as part of the consolidation, the Company absorbed all of the employees responsible for managing the customer base, technical support, sales, customer service, and administration.\nStock Compensation expense. Stock compensation expense decreased by $400,000, or 64% from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The decrease between periods is attributed to the Company only recognizing $97,863 in stock option expense associated with stock options awarded to various employees and recognized $125,250 in stock issued to consultants for professional services during the year ended July 31, 2022. In comparison, during the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company recognized stock option expense of $135,000 associated with stock options awarded to various employees, recognized $247,000 in stock compensation expense associated with the funding of the 401(K)-profit sharing plan, recognized $18,000 in stock compensation for stock issued in lieu of cash payments to a former employee, and recognized $223,000 in stock issued to consultants for professional services.\nLegal and professional fees. Legal and professional fees increased by $2,142,000, or 240% from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase between periods is attributed to the recognition during the year ended July 31, 2022, of $1,850,000 in legal and professional fees related to due diligence, audits for the acquisitions, purchase price allocation, legal fees paid to counsel for Post Road, and investor relations.\nBad debt. Bad debt increased between the periods by $81,000. The increase is attributed to the recognition of $98,000 in bad debt during the year ended July 31, 2022, for accounts deemed uncollectable. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company recognized $17,000 in bad debt.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $1,167,000, from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase is primarily attributed to the acquisitions and related amortization of $2,414,000 for intangible assets, and the additional depreciation related to the depreciation for the assets acquired from Nexogy, ActivePBX, Skynet and NextLevel.\nOperating loss. The Company reported an operating loss of $3,676,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022, compared to an operating loss of $2,398,000 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The increase in operating loss between periods is primarily due to the increase of SG&A of $5,815,000, legal fees of $2,142,000, bad debt of $81,000, and depreciation expense of $1,167,000. These increases were slightly offset by the increase in margin of $7,527,000 and the decrease in stock compensation expense of $400,000.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments. Loss on derivative instruments decreased by $16,121,000 from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. We are required to re-measure all derivative instruments at the end of each reporting period and adjust those instruments to market, as a result of the re-measurement of all derivative instruments we recognized an increase between periods.\nGain (loss) on settlement of debt. Loss on settlement of debt increased by $6,041,000 from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. On December 20, 2021, the Company and our lender entered into an amendment to a Credit Agreement, as described in Note 10, in connection with the amendment, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt for the amendment fee of $1,419,000 and the debt discount associated with the note of $4,061,000 was also recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt.\nIncome tax benefit (expense). During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $419,000. During the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $183,000.\nOther income (expense). Other expense decreased by $320,000 or 109% in the year ended July 31, 2022, compared to the year ended July 31, 2021.\nInterest Income (expense). Interest income (expense) increased by $1,225,000 from the year ended July 31, 2021, to the year ended July 31, 2022. During the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company recognized amortization of debt discount of $2,064,000 related to the adjustment to the present value of various convertible notes and debt. Additionally, the Company recognized $2,400,000 in interest cash payments to Post Road, $75,000 in interest cash payments on various promissory notes, accrual of $147,000 for interest expense for various promissory notes and $64,000 fair value of shares issued as well as $1,195,000 added to the principal balance of various promissory notes, all charged to interest expense as consideration for extension of the maturity dates.\nNet loss including noncontrolling interest. Net loss including noncontrolling interest for the year ended July 31, 2022, was $9,354,000, a decrease in net loss of $7,661,000, as compared to a net loss for the year ended July 31, 2021, of $17,015,000. The decrease in net loss including noncontrolling interest between periods is primarily due to the improvement in gain on derivative instruments of $16,121,000, increase in margin of $7,527,000, the decrease in stock compensation expense of $400,000 and increase in other income of $320,000. These improvements were slightly offset by the increase in SG&A of $5,815,000, the increase in legal fees of $2,142,000, increase in bad debt of $81,000, and the increase in depreciation and amortization of $1,167,000. In addition to the increase in interest expense of $1,225,000, increase of income tax expense of $236,000, and the loss on gain on settlement of debt of $6,041,000.\nNet loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest. During the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, the consolidated entity recognized net loss in noncontrolling interest of $1,341,000 and $332,000, respectively. The noncontrolling interest is presented as a separate line item in the Companys stockholders equity section of the balance sheet.\nNet loss attributable to Digeratis shareholders. Net loss for the year ended July 31, 2022, was $8,013,000 compared to a net loss for the year ended July 31, 2021, of $16,683,000.\nDeemed dividend on Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Dividend declared on convertible preferred stock for the year ended July 31, 2022, was $19,000 compared to a deemed dividend on convertible preferred stock for the year ended July 31, 2021, of $20,000.\nNet loss attributable to Digeratis common shareholders. Net loss for the year ended July 31, 2022, was $8,032,000 compared to a net loss for the year ended July 31, 2021, of $16,703,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Position: We had a consolidated cash balance of $1,509,000 as of July 31, 2022. Net cash consumed by operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2022, was approximately $1,960,000, primarily as a result of operating expenses, that included $98,000 in stock compensation and warrant expense, stock issued for services of $126,000, bad debt expense of $78,000, amortization of debt discount of $2,064,000, gain on derivative liability of $6,186,000, depreciation and amortization expense of $2,916,000, accrued expense of $566,000, accounts receivable of $484,000 and deferred revenue of $911,000. Additionally, accounts payable $860,000, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $20,000, other assets of $131,000, inventory of $18,000, a loss on settlement of debt of $5,481,000, the recognition of $225,000 debt extension fee charged to interest expense, gain on ActivePBX contingent earnout recognized in other income of $24,000 and stock issued for debt extension of $65,000.\nCash used in investing activities during the year ended July 31, 2022, was $12,885,000, which included $272,000 for the purchase of equipment, the cash paid of $12,791,000, net of cash received, for the acquisitions of VoIP assets from Skynet and NextLevel and the Company received $178,000 from Nexogy as an adjustment consideration for payables from the acquisition.\nCash provided by financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2022, was $14,865,000. The Company secured $806,000 from convertible notes, net of issuance costs and discounts. In addition, the Company secured $15,530,000 from promissory notes, net of issuance costs. (See Note 10) The Company made principal payments of $250,000 on various notes, principal payments of $425,000 on convertible notes and principal payments of 816,000 on related party notes. Overall, our net operating, investing, and financing activities during the year ended July 31, 2022, contributed approximately $20,000 of our available cash.\nDigeratis consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2022, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Companys inception in 1993, Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $113,393,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $29,323,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digeratis ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are currently taking initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2023 we anticipate certain members of our management team to take a portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend to adopt best practices from or recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources of revenue streams, we have also secured various agent agreements to accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues, we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a result, during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees.\nOur cash requirements to meet our interest payments to Post Road, capital expenditure needs, and operational cash flow needs over the next 18 months are estimated to be approximability $3,500,000. The Company anticipates issuing additional equity or entered into additional Convertible Notes to secure the funding required meet these cash needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to meet its interest payments, capital expenditures and operational needs. As a result, the Company will be required to negotiate with its lender the terms of the current financing agreements, in addition to postponing the timing of deployment of its capital expenditures and extending the timing of the operational cash needs.\nThe Credit Agreement with Post Road contains affirmative and negative covenants with respect to operation of the business and properties of T3 Nevada as well as financial performance. Below are key covenants requirements, (measured quarterly):\n1. Maximum Allowed - Senior Leverage Ratio of 4.06 to 1.00\n2. Minimum Allowed - EBITDA of $3,719,589\n3. Minimum Allowed - Liquidity of $2,000,000\n4. Maximum Allowed - Capital Expenditures of $94,798 (Quarterly)\n5. Minimum Allowed - Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.5 to 1.00\n6. Maximum Allowed - Churn of 3.00% at any time\nWhile Digerati, the parent company of T3 Nevada, is not subject to these financial covenants, they have had and will continue to have a material impact on T3 Nevadas expenditures and ability to raise funds.\nIn addition, our Term Loan C Note with Post Road with a maturity date of August 4, 2023, requires a full principal payment (currently $10,000,000) and accrued interest by the maturity date. We will work with our equity partners to secure additional financings to meet this obligation by the maturity date. In addition, we will work with our lender on the current terms to the Term Loan C Note, to extend the maturity date or restructure the terms of the note. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms to meet the cash payment requirements on the Term Loan C Note. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to restructure the terms or extend the maturity date of the Term Loan C Note with Post Road. If the Company is not able to restructure the financing or repay the Term Loan C Note by the August 4th maturity date and Post Road declares an event of default, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the possibility of Post Road foreclosing on some or all of our assets.\nManagement believes that available resources as of July 31, 2022, will not be sufficient to fund the Companys operations, debt service and corporate expenses over the next 12 months. The Companys ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, and other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.\nOur current cash expenses are expected to be approximately $1,300,000 per month, including wages, rent, utilities, corporate expenses, and legal professional fees associated with potential acquisitions. As described elsewhere herein, we are not generating sufficient cash from operations to pay for our corporate and ongoing operating expenses, or to pay our current liabilities. As of July 31, 2022, our total liabilities were approximately $67,503,000, which included $10,588,000 in derivative liabilities. We will continue to use our available cash on hand to cover our deficiencies in operating expenses.\nWe have been successful in raising debt capital and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 10, 11, and 12 to our consolidated financial statements. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. Although we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).\nThe Company recognizes cloud-based hosted services revenue, mainly from subscription services for its cloud telephony applications that includes hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, auto attendant, voice and web conferencing, call recording, messaging, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized applications. Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery services. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the Companys revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer.\nService Revenue\nService revenue from subscriptions to the Companys cloud-based technology platform is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue. Usage fees, either bundled or not bundled, are recognized when the Company has a right to invoice. Professional services for configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training and/or education are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by the Company directly. Alternatively, customers may choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers. Professional services revenue is recognized over time, generally as services are activated for the customer\nProduct Revenue\nThe Company recognizes product revenue for telephony equipment at a point in time, when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon delivery. Sales returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue estimated based on historical experience.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, and Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether goodwill has become impaired between annual impairment tests according to specifications set forth in ASC 350. The Company completed an evaluation of goodwill at July 31, 2022 and determined that there was no impairment.\nThe fair value of the Companys reporting unit is dependent upon the Companys estimate of future cash flows and other factors. The Companys estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the Companys market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at date of the evaluation.\nThe financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the Companys fair value measurement through the Companys weighted average cost of capital that the Company uses to determine its discount rate and through the Companys stock price that the Company uses to determine its market capitalization. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded.\nThe Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Such intangibles are amortized over their useful lives. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash flows and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, identifiable intangibles, and goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets.\nIntangible Assets. Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technologies, trademarks and trade name. The Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. The intangible assets are amortized following the patterns in which the economic benefits are consumed or straight-line over the estimated useful life. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The determination of impairment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If an intangible asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will be equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.\nLong-Lived Assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Digerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and fair value.\nBusiness combinations. Each investment in a business is being measured and determined whether the investment should be accounted for as a cost-basis investment, an equity investment, a business combination, or a common control transaction. An investment in which the Company do not have a controlling interest and which the Company is not the primary beneficiary but where the Company has the ability to exert significant influence is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those investments that we account for in accordance ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at managements estimate of their fair values on the date of the business combination. The assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on the reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives. Furthermore, according to ASC 805-50-30-5, when accounting for a transfer of assets or exchange of shares between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets or the equity interests shall initially measure the recognized assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer.\nStock-based compensation. The Company accounts for its share-based awards under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Employee and non-employee stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. During FY 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 1,500,000 common shares and 7,858,820 common shares, respectively, to professionals for exchange of services and various employees as part of our profit sharing-plan contribution and stock in lieu of cash. During FY 2022 and 2021 we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $125,250 and $264,712, respectively, equivalent to the market value of the shares issued calculated based on the shares closing price at the grant dates. During FY 2022 we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $97,863 related to stock options previously issued to various employees.\nTreasury Shares. As a result of entering into various convertible debt instruments which contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, warrants with fixed exercise price, and convertible notes with fixed conversion price or with a conversion price floor, we reserved 30,000,000 treasury shares for consideration for future conversions and exercise of warrants. The Company will evaluate the reserved treasury shares on a quarterly basis, and if necessary, reserve additional treasury shares. As of July 31, 2022, we believe that the treasury shares reserved are sufficient for any future conversions of these instruments. As a result, these debt instruments and warrants are excluded from derivative consideration.\nDerivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.\nFor derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date. Any changes in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period. For derivative notes payable conversion options Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.\nThe classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nFor certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of the acquired business in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with an acquisition. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and trademarks. The Company uses a third-party specialty valuation firm to value its intangible assets acquired in its business combination and asset acquisitions.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company acquired Skynet Telecom LLC and Next Level Internet, Inc. the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with the Company identified as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the purchase prices of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were recorded and allocated at fair value on a relative basis as of acquisition dates. The Company based its estimates on historical experience, discounted cash flows and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances at the time of acquisition, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair value of the intangible assets acquired that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results from these acquisitions may differ from these estimates.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of July 31, 2022, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot Applicable to smaller reporting companies. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nConsolidated Financial Statements of Digerati Technologies, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 206)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2022, and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended July 31, 2022, and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended July 31, 2022, and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended July 31, 2022, and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nDigerati Technologies, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digerati Technologies, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) as of July 31, 2022, and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nOctober 31, 2022\nPART 1.

(both referred to herein as T3), Nexogy Inc., and NextLevel Internet, Inc., provides cloud services specializing in Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) and broadband connectivity solutions for the business market. Our product line includes a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services delivered through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network and network services including Internet broadband, fiber, mobile broadband, and cloud WAN solutions (SD WAN). We provide enterprise-class, carrier-grade services to the small-to-medium-sized business (SMB) at cost-effective monthly rates. Our UCaaS or cloud communication services include fully hosted IP/PBX, video conferencing, mobile applications, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transport, SIP trunking, and customized VoIP services all delivered Only in the Cloud\u2122.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati in accordance with ASC 810-10-05. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nCost Method Investment.\nOn June 14, 2019, the Company, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) to acquire a 12% minority interest in Itellum Comunicacions Costa Rica, S.R.L. The Company paid $100,000 in cash, issued 500,000 shares of common stock with a market value of $85,000. As result, the Company holds a minority interest in Itellum for an investment of $185,000. The Company has no influence over the operating and financial policies of Itellum. The Company has no controlling interest, is not the primary beneficiary and does not have the ability to exert significant influence. As a result, we accounted for this investment using the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nUse of Estimates.\nIn preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBeneficial conversion features.\nThe Company evaluates the conversion feature for whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-30. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.\nRelated parties.\nThe Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with ASC 850 (Related Party Disclosures). A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.\nConcentration of Credit Risk.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of managements expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\nRevenue Recognition.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).\nSources of revenue:\nCloud-based hosted Services. The Company recognizes cloud-based hosted services revenue, mainly from subscription services for its cloud telephony applications that includes hosted IP/PBX services, SIP trunking, call center applications, auto attendant, voice, and web conferencing, call recording, messaging, voicemail to email conversion, integrated mobility applications that are device and location agnostic, and other customized applications. Other services include enterprise-class data and connectivity solutions through multiple broadband technologies including cloud WAN or SD-WAN (Software-defined Wide Area Network), fiber, and Ethernet over copper. We also offer remote network monitoring, data backup and disaster recovery services. The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Substantially all of the Companys revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer.\nService Revenue.\nService revenue from subscriptions to the Companys cloud-based technology platform is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription services being rendered are recorded as a deferred revenue. Usage fees, either bundled or not bundled, are recognized when the Company has a right to invoice. Professional services for configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training and/or education are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by the Company directly. Alternatively, customers may choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers. Professional services revenue is recognized over time, generally as services are activated for the customer.\nProduct Revenue.\nThe Company recognizes product revenue for telephony equipment at a point in time, when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon delivery. Sales returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue estimated based on historical experience.\nDisaggregation of Cloud-based hosted revenues.\nSummary of disaggregated revenue is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Years ended\nJuly 31,\nCloud software and service revenue $ 23,871 $ 12,153\nProduct revenue\nTotal operating revenues $ 24,154 $ 12,416\nContract Assets.\nContract assets are recorded for those parts of the contract consideration not yet invoiced but for which the performance obligations are completed. The revenue is recognized when the customer receives services or equipment for a reduced consideration at the onset of an arrangement; for example, when the initial months services or equipment are discounted. Contract assets are included in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, depending on if their reduction is recognized during the succeeding 12-month period or beyond. Contract assets as of July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021, were $6,701 and $17,661, respectively.\nDeferred Income.\nDeferred income represents billings or payment received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized upon transfer of control. Balances consist primarily of annual plan subscription services, for services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred revenues that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded as current deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder recorded as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred income as of July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021, were $66,167 and $19,984, respectively.\nCustomer deposits.\nThe Company in some instances requires customers to make deposits for the last month of services, equipment, installation charges and training. As equipment is installed and training takes places the deposits are then applied to revenue. The deposit for the last month of services is applied to any outstanding balances if services are cancelled. If the customers account is paid in full, the Company will refund the full deposit in the month following service termination. As of July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021, Digeratis customer deposits balance was $864,345 and $0, respectively. The customer deposit balance is included as part of deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCosts to Obtain a Customer Contract.\nDirect incremental costs of obtaining a contract, consisting of sales commissions, are deferred, and amortized over the estimated life of the customer, which currently averages 36 months. The Company calculates the estimated life of the customer on an annual basis. The Company classifies deferred commissions as prepaid expenses or other noncurrent assets based on the timing of when it expects to recognize the expense. As of July 31, 2022, the Company has $184,808 in deferred commissions/contract costs. Sales commissions expensed for the year ended July 31, 2022, and the year ended July 31, 2021, were $2,262,129 and $871,561, respectively. The cost to obtain customer contract balance is included as part of prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDirect Costs - Cloud-based hosted Services.\nWe incur bandwidth and colocation charges in connection with our UCaaS or cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connectivity between our customers to allow them access to our various services. We also incur costs from underlying providers for fiber, internet broadband, and telecommunication circuits in connection with our data and connectivity solutions.\nCash and cash equivalents.\nThe Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts.\nBad debt expense is recognized based on managements estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2022, and 2021, Digeratis allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $74,628 and $29,000, respectively.\nProperty and equipment.\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one (1) to seven (7) years.\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill is carried at cost and is not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether goodwill has become impaired between annual impairment tests according to specifications set forth in ASC 350. The Company completed an evaluation of goodwill at July 31, 2022 and 2021 and determined that there was no impairment.\nThe fair value of the Companys reporting unit is dependent upon the Companys estimate of future cash flows and other factors. The Companys estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the Companys market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at date of the evaluation.\nThe financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the Companys fair value measurement through the Companys weighted average cost of capital that the Company uses to determine its discount rate and through the Companys stock price that the Company uses to determine its market capitalization. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded.\nIntangible Assets.\nOur intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technologies, trademarks and trade name. The Company recognizes an acquired intangible asset apart from goodwill whenever the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. The intangible assets are amortized following the patterns in which the economic benefits are consumed or straight-line over the estimated useful life. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The determination of impairment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If an intangible asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will be equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of the acquired business in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with an acquisition. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and trademarks. The Company uses a third-party specialty valuation firm to value its intangible assets acquired in its business combination and asset acquisitions.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company acquired Skynet Telecom LLC and Next Level Internet, Inc. the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with the Company identified as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the purchase prices of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were recorded and allocated at fair value on a relative basis as of acquisition dates. The Company based its estimates on historical experience, discounted cash flows and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances at the time of acquisition, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair value of the intangible assets acquired that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results from these acquisitions may differ from these estimates.\nLong-Lived Assets.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets.\nDigerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and fair value.\nBusiness combinations.\nEach investment in a business is being measured and determined whether the investment should be accounted for as a cost-basis investment, an equity investment, a business combination, or a common control transaction. An investment in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and which the Company is not the primary beneficiary but where the Company has the ability to exert significant influence is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those investments that we account for in accordance ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the managements estimate of their fair values on the date of the business combination. The assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on the reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives. Furthermore, according to ASC 805-50-30-5, when accounting for a transfer of assets or exchange of shares between entities under common control, the entity that receives the net assets or the equity interests shall initially measure the recognized assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer.\nTreasury Shares.\nAs a result of entering into various convertible debt instruments which contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, warrants with fixed exercise price, and convertible notes with fixed conversion price or with a conversion price floor, we reserved 30,000,000 treasury shares for consideration for future conversions and exercise of warrants. The Company will evaluate the reserved treasury shares on a quarterly basis, and if necessary, reserve additional treasury shares. As of July 31, 2022, we believe that the treasury share reserved are sufficient for any future conversions of these instruments. As a result, these debt instruments and warrants are excluded from derivative consideration.\nDerivative financial instruments.\nDigerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting.\nFor derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date. Any changes in fair value are recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period. For derivative notes payable conversion options and warrants Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments.\nThe classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nFor certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\nOur derivative liabilities as of July 31, 2022, and 2021 of $10,588,000 and $16,773,000, respectively.\nThe following table provides the fair value of the derivative financial instruments measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs:\nFair value measurements at reporting date using:\nDescription Fair Value Quoted prices in\nactive markets\nfor identical\nliabilities\n(Level 1) Significant\nother\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nunobservable inputs\n(Level 3)\nConvertible promissory notes derivative liability at July 31, 2021 $ 16,773,383 - - $ 16,773,383\nConvertible promissory notes derivative liability at July 31, 2022 $ 10,587,717 - - $ 10,587,717\nThe fair market value of all derivatives during the year ended July 31, 2022, was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions:\nExpected dividend yield 0.00 %\nExpected stock price volatility 63.32% - 250.19 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.03% - 2.98 %\nExpected term 0.05 - 9.50 years\nThe fair market value of all derivatives during the year ended July 31, 2021, was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions:\nExpected dividend yield 0.00 %\nExpected stock price volatility 125.60% - 283.01 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.05% - 1.65 %\nExpected term 0.03 - 10.00 years\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:\nBalance at July 31, 2020 $ 606,123\nDerivative from new convertible promissory notes and warrants recorded as debt discount 6,820,108\nDerivative liability resolved to additional paid in capital due to debt conversion (588,097 )\nDerivative loss 9,935,249\nBalance at July 31, $ 16,773,383\nDerivative gain (6,185,666 )\nBalance at July 31, $ 10,587,717\nIncome taxes.\nDigerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.\nSince January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. As of July 31, 2022, we have no liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nStock-based compensation.\nStock-based compensation. The Company accounts for its share-based awards under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Employee and non-employee stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. During FY 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 1,500,000 common shares and 7,858,820 common shares, respectively to professionals for exchange of services and various employees as part of our profit sharing-plan contribution and stock in lieu of cash. During FY 2022 and 2021 we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $125,250 and $264,712, respectively equivalent to the market value of the shares issued calculated based on the shares closing price at the grant dates. During FY 2022 we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $97,863 related to stock options previously issued to various employees.\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share.\nThe basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an as if converted basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, potential dilutive securities including options and warrants were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share as their effect would be anti-dilutive due to the Companys net loss. Potential dilutive securities, which are not included in dilutive weighted average shares are as follows:\n7/31/2022 7/31/2021\nOptions to purchase common stock 9,130,000 9,230,000\nWarrants to purchase common stock 108,841,179 109,506,179\nConvertible debt 43,628,667 20,506,684\nConvertible Series A Preferred stock 750,000 750,000\nConvertible Series B Preferred stock 25,575,847 24,936,847\nConvertible Series C Preferred stock 31,259,369 30,478,369\nTotal: 219,185,062 195,408,079\nNoncontrolling interest.\nThe Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation, which governs the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (NCIs) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parents ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance. The net income (loss) attributed to the NCI is separately designated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).\nOn May 1, 2018, T3 Communications, Inc. (T3), a Nevada Corporation, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (\u2018SPA), whereby in an exchange for $250,000, T3 agreed to sell to the buyers 199,900 shares of common stock equivalent to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding common share of T3 Communications, Inc. The $250,000 of the cash received under this transaction was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and as an increase in additional paid-in capital in T3. At the option of the Company, and for a period of five years following the date of the SPA, the 199,900 shares of common stock in T3 may be converted into Common Stock of Digerati at a ratio of 3.4 shares of DTGI Common stock for everyone (1) share of T3 at any time after the DTGI Common Stock has a current market price of $1.50 or more per share for 20 consecutive trading days.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company accounted for a noncontrolling interest of $1,341,000 and $332,000, respectively. Additionally, one of the buyers serves as a Board Member of T3 Communications, Inc., a Florida Corporation, one of our operating subsidiaries.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which generally required an acquirer, in a business combination, to recognize and measure the acquired contract assets and liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquirees financial statements. We applied the provisions of ASU 2021-08 to the acquisitions of Next Level Internet, Inc. and Skynet Telecom LLC.\nRecent accounting pronouncements, other than below, issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC did not, or are not, believed by management to have a material effect on the Companys present or future financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 47020) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments. Either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition is permissible for the adoption of this standard. Update No. 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted no earlier than the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on its financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN\nFinancial Condition\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Since the Companys inception in 1993, the Company has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $113,393,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $29,323,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digeratis ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement Plans to Continue as a Going Concern\nManagement believes that available resources as of July 31, 2022, will not be sufficient to fund the Companys operations and corporate expenses over the next 12 months. The Companys ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, and other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.\nWe are currently taking initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2022 certain members of our executive management team have taken a significant portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend to adopt best practices from our recent acquisitions and invest in a marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers and channel partners to tap into new sources of revenue streams; and we have also secured numerous agent agreements through our recent acquisitions that we anticipate will accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues, we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. As a result, during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees.\nWe have been successful in raising debt and equity capital in the past and as described in Notes 10, 11 and 12. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings. Although we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.\nThe current Credit Agreement with Post Road will allow the Company to continue acquiring UCaaS service providers that meet the Companys acquisition criteria. Management anticipates that future acquisitions will provide additional operating revenues to the Company as it continues to execute on its consolidation strategy. There can be no guarantee that the planned acquisitions will close or that they will produce the anticipated revenues on the schedule anticipated by management.\nThe Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.\nDigeratis consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2022, do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digeratis plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nBelow are summarized changes in intangible assets at July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021:\nJuly 31, 2022 Gross Carrying\nValue Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying\nAmount\nNetSapiens - license, 10 years $ 150,000 $ (150,000 ) $ -\nCustomer relationships, 5 years 40,000 (36,684 ) 3,316\nCustomer relationships, 7 years 10,947,262 (2,573,052 ) 8,374,210\nTrademarks, 7 & 10 years 7,148,000 (993,806 ) 6,154,194\nNon-compete, 2 & 3 years 931,000 (394,583 ) 536,417\nMarketing & Non-compete, 5 years 800,263 (679,980 ) 120,283\nTotal Definite-lived Intangible Assets 20,016,525 (4,828,105 ) 15,188,420\nGoodwill 19,380,080 - 19,380,080\nBalance, July 31, 2022 $ 39,396,605 $ (4,828,105 ) $ 34,568,500\nJuly 31, 2021 Gross Carrying\nValue Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying\nAmount\nNetSapiens - license, 10 years $ 150,000 $ (150,000 ) $ -\nCustomer relationships, 5 years 40,000 (28,672 ) 11,328\nCustomer relationships 7 years 6,790,000 (1,310,720 ) 5,479,280\nTrademarks, 7 years 2,870,000 (307,500 ) 2,562,500\nNon-compete, 2 & 3 years 291,000 (97,500 ) 193,500\nMarketing & Non-compete, 5 years 800,000 (520,000 ) 280,000\nTotal Definite-lived Intangible Assets 10,941,000 (2,414,392 ) 8,526,608\nGoodwill 3,931,298 - 3,931,298\nBalance, July 31, 2021 $ 14,872,298 $ (2,414,392 ) $ 12,457,906\nTotal amortization expense for the year ended July 31, 2022, and 2021 was $2,448,274 and $1,396,214, respectively.\nNOTE 4 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nFollowing is a summary of Digeratis property and equipment at July 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nUseful lives\nTelecom equipment & software 1-7 years $ 2,878 $ 1,345\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(1,231 ) (816 )\nNet-property and equipment\n$ 1,647 $ 529\nNOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES\nDigerati files a consolidated tax return. The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2022, Digerati had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26,356,740 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities; net loss from 2018 and on will be carryforward indefinitely, the net loss carryforwards prior to 2018 started expiring in 2021. Under the enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the new effective Corporate flat tax rate is 21% (effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017). Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021 are as follows:\nThe effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows:\nExpected Federal benefit (provision), at statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nChange in valuation allowance (21.0 )% (21.0 )%\n0.0 % 0.0 %\nDeferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2022 and 2021:\nNet operating loss carryover $ 5,534,915 $ 3,242,773\nValuation allowance (5,534,915 ) (3,242,773 )\nTotal deferred tax asset, net $ - $ -\nThe change in the valuation allowance for 2022 resulted in an increase of approximately $2,292,142. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digeratis consolidated financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. The Company files a calendar year return, and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.\nThe federal and state NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could significantly restrict the Companys ability to use the NOLs to offset taxable income in subsequent years.\nWe record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.\nNOTE 6 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn November 2015, the Company adopted the Digerati Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Plan authorizes the grant of up to 7.5 million stock options, restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain other persons. The Plan is intended to permit the Company to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall success of the Company. The Companys Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted common stock, and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company extended the expiration date on 1,150,000 previously issued stock options to various employees until July 31, 2025, and the exercise price of these options was set at $0.11 per share. The modification of these stock options created a nominal expense to the Company.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, we issued:\n\u25cf 7,858,820 shares of common stock to various employees for services in lieu of cash compensation and as part of the Companys Non-Standardized profit-sharing plan. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $264,712 equivalent to the value of the shares calculated based on the shares closing price at the grant dates.\n\u25cf 4,230,000 options to purchase common shares to various employees with an exercise price ranging from $0.042 to $0.1475 per share and a term of 5 years. At issuance, 200,000 of the options vested, 400,000 of the options will vest equally over a period of two years, and 3,630,000 of the options will vest equally over a period of three years. At issuance the stock options had a fair market value of $267,343.\nThe fair market value of all options issued during the year ended July 31, 2021, were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which used the following assumptions:\nExpected dividend yield 0.00 %\nExpected stock price volatility 197.71% - 198.82 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.22% - 0.34 %\nExpected term 2.0 - 3.0 years.\nDigerati recognized approximately $98,000 and $399,500 in stock-based compensation expense to employees during the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Unamortized compensation cost totaled $97,972 and $195,835 at July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021, respectively.\nA summary of the stock options as of July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021, and the changes during the years ended July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021:\nOptions Weighted-\naverage exercise price Weighted-\naverage remaining contractual term (years)\nOutstanding at July 31, 2020 5,000,000 $ 0.27 2.66\nGranted 4,230,000 $ 0.05 4.39\nExercised -\n-\n-\nForfeited and cancelled -\n-\n-\nOutstanding at July 31, 2021 9,230,000 $ 0.17 2.93\nGranted -\n-\n-\nExercised -\n-\n-\nForfeited and cancelled (100,000 ) $ 0.25 -\nOutstanding at July 31, 2022 9,130,000 $ 0.17 2.39\nExercisable at July 31, 2022 7,551,179 $ 0.20 2.11\nThe aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) of the 9,130,000 and 9,230,000 stock options outstanding at July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021 was $191,722 and $392,891, respectively.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the 7,551,179 and 6,091,863 stock options exercisable at July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021 was $110,380 and $91,978, respectively.\nNOTE 7 - WARRANTS\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company did not issue any warrants.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, we issued the following warrants.\nOn November 17, 2020, the Company issued 107,701,179 Warrants to Post Road Special Opportunity Fund II LP (the Warrant) to purchase, initially, twenty-five percent (25%) of the Companys total shares (the Warrant), calculated on a fully-diluted basis as of the date of issuance (the Warrant Shares) and subject to a reduction to fifteen percent (15%) as described below.\nThe number of Warrant Shares is adjustable to allow the holder to maintain, subject to certain share issuances that are exceptions, the right to purchase twenty-five percent (25%) of the Companys total shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis. The Warrant has an exercise price of $0.01 per share and the Warrant expires on November 17, 2030. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the Warrant Shares are immediately fully vested and not subject to forfeiture at any time for any reason. The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the Warrant Shares are subject to forfeiture based on the Company achieving certain performance targets which, if achieved, would result in twenty percent (20%) warrant coverage. If the minority shareholders of T3 Nevada convert their T3 Nevada shares into shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), the Warrant Shares percentage shall also be lowered such that when combined with the achievement of the performance targets, the warrant coverage could be reduced to fifteen percent (15%).\nIn connection with the issuance of the Warrant, the three executives of the Company, Art Smith, Antonio Estrada, and Craig Clement entered into a Tag-Along Agreement (the Tag-Along Agreement) whereby they agreed that the holder of the Warrant or Warrant Share will have the right to participate or tag-along in any agreements to sell any shares of their Common Stock that such executives enter into. The Company also agreed, in connection with the issuance of the Warrant and pursuant to a Board Observer Agreement (the Board Observer Agreement), to grant Post Road the right to appoint a representative to each of the boards of directors of the Company and each of its subsidiaries, to attend all board meeting in a non-voting observer capacity. In addition, at issuance the Company recognized $6,462,050 in derivative liability associated with these warrants.\nA summary of the warrants as of July 31, 2022, and 2021, and the changes during the years ended July 31, 2022, and 2021 are presented below:\nWarrants Weighted-\naverage exercise price Weighted-\naverage remaining contractual term (years)\nOutstanding at July 31, 2020 2,540,000 $ 0.33 1.61\nGranted 107,701,179 $ 0.01 9.50\nExercised (330,000 ) $ 0.10 -\nExpired (405,000 ) $ 0.50 -\nOutstanding at July 31, 2021 109,506,179 $ 0.01 9.17\nExercised -\n-\n-\nExpired (665,000 ) $ 0.18 -\nOutstanding at July 31, 2022 108,841,179 $ 0.01 8.21\nExercisable at July 31, 2022 81,615,885 $ 0.01 8.22\nThe aggregate intrinsic value (the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the period and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money warrants) of the 108,841,179 and 109,506,179 warrants outstanding at July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021 was $9,002,606 and $14,795,002, respectively.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the 81,615,885 and 82,280,885 warrants exercisable at July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021 was $6,757,037 and $11,108,930, respectively.\nNOTE 8 - NON-STANDARDIZED PROFIT-SHARING PLAN\nWe currently provide a Non-Standardized Profit-Sharing Plan, adopted September 15, 2006.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15a-15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July 31, 2022.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs of July 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report; such internal controls and procedures were not effective based on the COSO criteria. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were:\n1. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. We lack multiple levels of review over financial reporting. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the controls deficiency and lack of multiple levels of review over financial reporting represented a material weakness.\nThe aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our internal statements as of July 31, 2022.\nManagements Remediation Initiatives\nIn an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate the following:\n(1) We plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with controls objectives and to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. In addition, we intend to improve the supervision and training of our accounting personnel.\nWe are continuing our efforts to improve and strengthen our control processes and procedures to fully remedy these deficiencies. Our management and directors will continue to work with our auditors and other outside advisors to ensure that our controls and procedures are adequate and effective.\nThe Company is not required by current SEC rules to include and does not include an auditors attestation report. The Companys registered public accounting firm has not attested to managements reports on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.\nNone\nITEM 9C.

Our Board of Directors maintains decision-making authority with respect to these executive compensation matters.\nOur Board of Directors reviews the recommendations of our management with respect to total executive compensation and each element of compensation when making pay decisions. In allocating compensation among compensation elements, we emphasize incentive, not fixed compensation to ensure that executives only receive superior pay for superior results. We equally value short- and long-term compensation because both short- and long-term results are critical to our success. In addition, our compensation program includes various benefits provided to all employees, including life insurance, health insurance and other customary benefits. The objectives and details of why each element of compensation is paid are described below.\nBase Salary. Our objective for paying base salaries to executives is to reward them for performing the core responsibilities of their positions and to provide a level of security with respect to a portion of their compensation. We consider a number of factors when setting base salaries for executives, including:\n\u25cf Existing salary levels;\n\u25cf Competitive pay practices;\n\u25cf Individual and corporate performance; and\n\u25cf Internal equity among our executives, taking into consideration their relative contributions to our success.\nLong-term Incentive Awards. We award long-term incentive compensation to focus our executives on our long-term growth and stockholder return, as well as to encourage our executives to remain with us for the long-term. Long-term incentive awards are primarily in the form of grants of stock options and/or stock award pursuant to our 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the Plan). We selected this form because of the favorable accounting and tax treatment and the expectation of key employees in our industry that they would receive stock options and/or stock grants. We do not have pre-established target award amounts for long-term incentive grants. In determining long-term incentive awards for the Named Executive Officers, our Board of Directors relies on recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer, who considers the individual performance of the executives, the relation of the award to base salary and annual incentive compensation and associated accounting expense.
