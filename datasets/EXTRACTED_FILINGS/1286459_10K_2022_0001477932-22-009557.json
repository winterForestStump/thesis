    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nDescription of Business\nAll for One Media Corp. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Utah on March 2, 2004. The Company is a media and entertainment company focused on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups commonly referred to as boy bands and girl groups.\nOn October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement (the Asset Exchange) with Crazy For The Boys, LLC (CFTB), a privately held company, and certain members owning membership interest in CFTB whereby the Company acquired certain assets from CFTB in exchange for 5,201,500 shares of the Companys common stock. The assets that were acquired included a movie screenplay, master recordings, trademarks, and web domain names (the CFTB Assets).\nOn December 7, 2016, the Company organized a subsidiary in the state of Nevada, Crazy for the Boys Movie, LLC (CFTB Movie) which was created for the sole purpose of financing, producing and commercially exploiting (via all distribution sources and other means of revenue generation) one feature-length motion picture as a coming of age, musical dramedy, entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys) and all of its allied, ancillary, subsidiary and merchandising rights. The Company is the Managing Member of CFTB Movie and will have the sole and exclusive right to operate CFTB Movie. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company owns approximately 70% of CFTB Movie, the Companys majority owned subsidiary.\nIn May 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement with Crazy for the Boys GA LLC (CFTB GA), a company organized in the state of Georgia, whereby CFTB GA assigned and transferred all ownership, asset rights and other interest in CFTB GA to CFTB Movie. CFTB GA was created for the sole purpose of producing the Movie in the State of Georgia, in the city of Savannah, which offers production incentives up to 30% of Georgia production expenditures in transferable tax credits. The Georgia tax incentive program is available for qualifying projects, including feature films, television series, commercials, music videos, animation and game development. Consequently, CFTB GA became a wholly owned subsidiary of CFTB Movie and as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CFTB GA. Filming for the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. The Company started to screen the movie in January 2019 for potential buyers. The Company had received several offers for the distribution of the film and the Company continues to review any offers.\nAll For One Media Corp. is in the business of targeting the lucrative tween demographic across a multitude of entertainment platforms. The Companys primary business objective is to embark on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups, commonly referred to as boy bands and girl groups, by utilizing both traditional and social media models. All For One Media owns over fifty completed professionally produced master recordings, as well as a full-length motion picture entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys) (the Film) that is ready for release. This musical comedys backstory creates a fictional girl group by the name of Drama Drama, and the Company intends to launch a new girl group with the same name simultaneous to the release of the Film.\nThe Company expects to generate revenues from movie receipts, sales, downloads and streaming of original recorded music, videos, motion pictures, music publishing, live performances, licensed merchandise and corporate sponsorships.\nOn January 17, 2020, our parent entity, entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with, our former subsidiary, Carmel Valley Productions Inc. (CVPI) whereby the Company sold 90% of its 100% interest in CVPI and any of the Companys right to receive revenues or repayment from the $100,000 advance on film rights under the terms of the Co-Production and Finance Agreement dated on July 24, 2019, for a total purchase price of $50,000.\nOn February 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Quiver Distribution RB USA, Inc (Quiver) to distribute (Distribution Agreement) our full-length PG13-rated feature film, Drama Drama, (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys). Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, rights for all forms of VOD (including but not limited to transactional, subscription and advertising), EST, television, non-theatrical were given to Quiver and all other rights were reserved to the Company including ad-free Youtube rights. In addition, after Quiver has deducted its distribution fee and recouped 100% of its actual, direct, arms-length expenses (distribution expenses), 100% of the backed participation shall go to the Company. Further, Quiver shall earn a distribution fee of 20%, increasing to 30% once Quiver has returned $400,000 to the Company. As of September 30, 2022, Quiver had not yet recouped their distribution expenses and we have not realized any revenue.\nThe film, Drama Drama, was released on June 1, 2021, available across all major platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Vudu, Fandango Now, Comcast, Cox, Spectrum, DirectTV, and Dish, among others. In addition, Drama Drama is available on Youtube, where it is approaching five million views and has been watched in over 100 countries on 5 continents.\nThis first window in the release process was SVOD (Streaming) as discussed above and the second window in the release process will be by International Sales, Cable and Broadcast TV. In addition, the Drama Drama Official Soundtrack has been released through all major music streaming platforms on May 18, 2021, including Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\nAs previously discussed, Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys), the motion picture, has tested well with our target tween and teen demographic in its own right, but has also been designed to serve as a 100-minute launch vehicle for Drama Drama, the girl group.\nOur goal is to generate revenues related to the Drama Drama franchise from the movie, music, merchandising, live concert performances, and additional sources.\nWe are currently exploring opportunities to expand the Drama Drama brand and has held several talks about a short or long form sequels well as new Drama Drama recordings and Music Videos. In FY 2022, the Company released the song and Dance Video Snoochie Boochie which was written by Billboard award winning song writer Sam Hollander and produced by multi-platinum producer Rob Grimaldi.\nThe Company plans on introducing a new music platform in 2023 with the release of two new singles and accompanied by Music Videos.\nIn addition, the Company is developing a new Screen Play, with the expectation that it will be produced in FY 2023 and completing a sizzle reel for the Dream Street documentary which will be released in Q2 2023.\nWe plan on introducing other entertainment initiatives that are currently in earlier stages of discussion. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis investment has a high degree of risk. Before you invest you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed and the value of our stock could go down. This means you could lose all or a part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations.\nThe occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe may not achieve profitability or positive cash flow.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow will be dependent upon such factors as our ability to organize and promote concerts. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we expect to incur expenses that will exceed revenues for an unknown period of time. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues to support operations in the future.\nWe have a limited operating history which may not be an indicator of our future results.\nWe are an early-stage company with a limited capital base. We have been engaged in organization and start-up activities related to financing the launch of a girl group band. We have no operating history investors may use to evaluate our future performance. As a result of our limited operating history, our plan for rapid growth, and the increasingly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, the historical financial data is of limited value in evaluating our future revenue and operating expenses. Our planned expense levels will be based in part on expectations concerning future revenue, which is difficult to forecast accurately based on current plans of expansion and growth. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue. Further, general and administrative expenses may increase significantly as we expand operations. To the extent that these expenses precede, or are not rapidly followed by, a corresponding increase in revenue, our business, operating results, and financial condition will suffer.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of proprietary copyrights.\nWe intend to derive all revenue from two properties, the Drama Drama film and the associated soundtrack, which, even if successful, will likely generate revenues for only a limited period of time. Because our licensing revenue is highly subject to the changing trends in the entertainment business, our licensing revenue may be subject to dramatic increases and decreases. Nevertheless, we feel that by promoting these two properties to launch our brand, we can successfully leverage the maturity of social media to connect tweens with content that is relevant and with which they can identify. We plan to expand our operations with other films and the creation of a girl band and boy band.\nCompetition in the entertainment industry may make it difficult to succeed long-term.\nThe recorded music, motion picture, and music publishing industries are highly competitive. Our competition includes major media and entertainment studios, independent film and music production companies, and television networks, both generally and concurrently at the time of release of our respective content. We compete with larger production studios that are better capitalized, who can fund projects based on the returns of prior productions. We will compete with these companies for artists, talent, airtime, and space in retail outlets. We are not at present, and do not expect in the foreseeable future to be, a significant participant in this marketplace. The market for music and movie production, distribution, and marketing is very competitive, and our lack of experience, compared to that of these competitors, may impair our ability to successfully produce content that creates a positive return on investment. Furthermore, we face indirect competition from alternative forms of leisure, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, and other cultural activities.\nThe entertainment industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant change. Other entertainment companies currently offer one or more of each of the types of products and services we plan to offer. In addition, our music and motion picture productions will compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with music and motion pictures produced and distributed by other larger, more established companies. As a result, the success of any of our recorded music products or motion pictures is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on numerous independent companies with whom we may partner. Some of our competitors in the music business will include Motown, Time Warner Inc., Universal Music Group, Sony BMG, and EMI, and numerous independent companies. We expect that our film business will compete with well-established companies, including MGM, DreamWorks, Time Warner Inc., Sony, Paramount, and Universal, as well as numerous small independent companies, all of which produce, develop or market films, DVDs, television, and cable programming.\nThe Company must respond successfully to ongoing changes in the U.S. video entertainment industry and consumer viewing patterns to remain competitive.\nThe Company expects that a substantial portion of its revenues and profits will be derived from the production and licensing of video entertainment offerings. The U.S. video entertainment industry is evolving, with developments in technology leading to new video services that are experiencing rapid growth, resulting in higher overall video content consumption as well as a shift in consumer viewing patterns as consumers seek more control over when, where, and how they view video content. These changes pose risks to the traditional U.S. television industry and some of the Companys business models, including the disruption of the traditional television content delivery model by video streaming services, some of which are growing rapidly. The Companys strategy to address these risks, including continuing to produce high-quality original content, and investing in technology and working with partners to enhance our content offerings, may not be successful. The Company may incur significant costs to implement its strategy and respond to and mitigate the risks from these changes, and, if not successful, could experience a significant adverse impact on the Companys competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\nThe popularity of content is difficult to predict and can change rapidly and low public acceptance of the Companys content will adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe revenues expected from the sale, distribution, and licensing of television programming, feature films, music, and other content will depend primarily on widespread public acceptance of that content, which is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The Company must invest substantial amounts in the production and marketing of its content before it learns whether such content will reach anticipated levels of popularity with consumers. The popularity of the Companys content depends on many factors, only some of which are within the Companys control. Examples include the popularity of competing content (including locally-produced content internationally), the availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities, the Companys ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences and the Companys ability to successfully anticipate (and timely adapt its content to) changes in consumer tastes in the countries and territories in which the Company operates. Low public acceptance of the Companys content will adversely affect its results of operations.\nGenerally, feature films that perform well upon initial release also have commercial success in subsequent distribution channels. Therefore, the underperformance of a feature film, especially an event film, upon its public release can result in lower than expected revenues for the Company from the license of the film to broadcast and cable networks. If a new event film fails to achieve commercial success upon release, it may limit the Companys ability to create new content. The failure to develop successful new content could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nConsumer purchasing habits are not consistent throughout the year.\nSales of music and licensed goods concepts are seasonal, with a high percentage of retail sales occurring during the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. As a result of the seasonal nature of our industry, we would be significantly and adversely affected by unforeseen events that negatively impact the retail environment or consumer buying patterns, particularly if such events were to impact the key-selling season.\nSome initiatives to respond to and address the changes to the U.S. entertainment industry and consumer viewing and listening patterns may be outside the Companys control.\nWhile the Company supports the development of better consumer interfaces, the development and implementation of these interfaces are often outside the Companys control. In addition, the Company may not be able to introduce new business models and products to enhance the value of its content without the cooperation of affiliates or other partners.\nAdvances in technology may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nAdvances in technology may affect the manner in which entertainment content is distributed to consumers. These changes, which might affect the entertainment industry as a whole, include the proliferation of digital music players, cloud-based services that allow consumers to download and store single songs, and pay-per-view movie services. These developments have created new outlets for consumers to purchase entertainment content. These new outlets may affect the quantity of entertainment products available for purchase and may reduce the amount that consumers are willing to pay for particular products. As a result, there could be a negative impact on our ability to sell DVDs and CDs. Any failure to adapt our business model to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nOur success will depend on external factors in the music and film industries.\nOperating in the music and film industries involves a substantial degree of risk. Each planned girl group and boy band music project or film production is an individual artistic work, and unpredictable audience reactions determine commercial success. The commercial success of a music or film project also depends on:\n\u00b7\nthe quality and acceptance of other competing records or films released into the marketplace at or near the same time;\n\u00b7\ncritical reviews;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nvarious other tangible and intangible factors.\nEach of these factors is subject to change and cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that our planned music and film projects will receive favorable ratings or reviews or that consumers will purchase our entertainment products and services.\nThe Companys results of operations may be adversely affected if the Companys efforts to increase sales of its video content and make digital ownership of content more compelling to consumers are not successful.\nSeveral factors have contributed to an industry-wide decline in sales of home entertainment products in physical formats in recent years, including consumers shifting to on demand video subscriptions and electronic purchases and rentals; consumers electing to rent films using discount rental kiosks; changing retailer strategies and initiatives (e.g., reduction in floor space devoted to home entertainment products in physical formats); retail store closures; weak economic conditions; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. The Companys efforts to offset the decline in sales of home entertainment products in physical formats and to make digital ownership of content more attractive to consumers may not be successful or may take several more years to become successful.\nThe Company may be adversely affected if distributors fail to adequately promote our creative projects.\nDecisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support of our girl group and boy band music, music video, motion picture, television, and related licensing products are important in determining the success of the Company. As with most production companies, we do not control the manner in which our distributing partners distribute our content to final consumers. Although our distributors will have a financial interest in the success of our girl group and boy band projects, and decision by our distributors to not promote our products, or to promote a competitors products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf the Company fails to compete successfully against alternative sources of entertainment, there may be an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nThe Company competes with all other sources of entertainment, including television, premium pay television services, on demand video subscriptions, feature films, the Internet, home entertainment products, videogames, social networking, print media, pirated content, live sports and other events, for consumers leisure and entertainment time and discretionary spending. The increased number of media and entertainment choices available to consumers has made it much more difficult to attract and obtain their attention and time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors.\nThe Company must protect its intellectual property.\nWe will rely on copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights law to protect the intellectual property of our girl group and boy band projects. Our business is subject to the risk of third parties infringing on these intellectual property rights. We may need to pursue litigation to protect our intellectual property and that of our authorized licensors, which could result in substantial costs and divert resources.\nThreats of piracy of the Companys content, products, and other intellectual property may further decrease the revenues received from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content and adversely affect its business and profitability.\nThough the Company has never been victim of copyright piracy, it may be negatively affected this practice, and any piracy of the Companys content, products and other intellectual property could reduce the revenues the Company earns from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content, products and other intellectual property. The risks relating to piracy have increased in recent years due to technological developments that have made it easier to create, distribute and store high-quality unauthorized copies of content, such as the proliferation of cloud-based storage and streaming services, increased broadband Internet speeds and penetration rates, and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission. Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and technical legal protections or enforcement measures, and illegitimate operators based in those parts of the world can attract viewers from anywhere in the world. Once our projects are produced for mass distribution, the Company will devote the necessary resources to protect its content, products and intellectual property, but these efforts to enforce rights and combat piracy may not be successful.\nThe Company may be subject to claims that it infringed intellectual property rights of others, which could require the Company to change its business practices.\nSuccessful claims that the Company infringes on the intellectual property rights of others could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or require the Company to change its business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes a claim of intellectual property infringement is without merit, defending against the claim can be time-consuming and costly and divert managements attention and resources away from its businesses.\nWe may be negatively affected by adverse general economic conditions.\nCurrent conditions in domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain. Adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies, wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat of terrorism and war, and other factors capable of affecting economic conditions. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Companys businesses are subject to labor interruption.\nThe Company and some of its suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of its television, feature film, and music content, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Such actions or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in the production of the Companys television programming and feature films. The Company could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industry-wide agreements, and the Company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Depending on their duration, such union or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nOur success depends largely on our management.\nWe are dependent on the continued employment of Brian Lukow, our President and CEO. Although we believe that we would be able to locate a suitable replacement, if we lose the services of Mr. Lukow, we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so. Additionally, our future operating results will substantially depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, financial, technical, creative, and administrative personnel. Competition for such people is intense and can lead to increased compensation expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe need to obtain additional financing in order to continue our operations.\nOn a prospective basis, we will require both short-term financing for operations and long-term capital to fund our expected growth. We have no existing bank lines of credit and have not established any definitive sources for additional financing programs. The entertainment industry is rapidly evolving and our inability to take advantage of opportunities because of capital constraints may have a material adverse effect on our current business and future prospects.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nOur stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders.\nThe stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, and the market prices of companies listed on the OTC Pink and other similarly-tiered quotation boards have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our common stock.\nDomestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices, or at all.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stockbrokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons, those persons tend to be risk-averse and may be reluctant to follow, purchase, or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nThe market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nShareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nBecause the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in shares of penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade our securities. This means that you may have difficulty reselling your shares, which may cause the value of your investment to decline.\nOur shares are classified as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers-dealers who sell our securities. For sales of our securities, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination and receive a written agreement prior from you to making a sale on your behalf. Because of the imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that broker-dealers will not want to make a market in our common stock. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the value of your investment to decline.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) sales practice requirements may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFINRA rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\nVolatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and FINRA, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.\nSales of our currently issued and outstanding stock and conversions of notes into issued and outstanding stock may become freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 and may dilute the market for your shares and have a depressive effect on the price of the shares of our common stock.\nA majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) (Rule 144). As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that one year following a company filing Form 10 information with the SEC to that effect, a non-affiliate who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months may sell their shares of common stock. Under Rule 144, affiliates who have held restricted securities for a period of at least six months may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a companys outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock.\nWe may finance our operations and develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or debt securities, which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our stock and in any event, may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nOur preferred stock could be issued to inhibit potential investors or delay or prevent a change of control that may favor you.\nSome of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Utah law could, together or separately, discourage potential acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control. In particular, our board of directors has issued preferred stock with preferential voting rights to our CEO, Brian Lukow.\nOur common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u00b7\nthat a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u00b7\nthe broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u00b7\nobtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u00b7\nmake a reasonable determination that the transaction in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u00b7\nsets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7\nthat the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nCompetition\nThe Company competes with all forms of entertainment. A large number of companies, many with significantly more resources than All for One Media, Inc., produce and distribute film and music recordings, exploit products in the home entertainment market, and produce music for live theater and performance. Our competitive position primarily depends on the amount and quality of the content produced, its distribution and marketing success, and public response. We also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties, and many other rights that are essential to the success of our business. Operating results for these offerings are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, consumer preferences, levels of marketing and promotion, and by the timing and performance of releases, which may be directly or indirectly influenced by competitors.\nTrademarks & Copyrights\nWe own the website URLs www.dramadrama.com, www.allforone.media and www.thescab.org.\nEffect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business\nChildrens Privacy\nVarious laws and regulations intended to protect the interests of children are applicable to our business, including measures designed to protect the privacy of minors online. As we are currently focused on marketing content to this demographic, we will be subject to these regulations. The U.S. Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) limits the collection of personal information online from children under the age of 13 by operators of websites or online services. Effective July 1, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission adopted revisions to regulations under COPPA to further expand the scope of the regulations. Such regulations also limit the types of advertising we are able to sell on our websites and applications and impose strict liability for certain actions of advertisers, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. State and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the Internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe may be deemed to be an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to such time if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, more than $700 million in market value of our common stock is held by non-affiliates or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

(the Company) was incorporated in the State of Utah on March 2, 2004. The Company is a media and entertainment company focused on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups commonly referred to as boy bands and girl groups. The Companys former operations were in the business of acquiring, training, and reselling horses with an emphasis in the purchase of thoroughbred weanlings or yearlings that were resold as juveniles.\nOn October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Exchange Agreement (the Asset Exchange) with Crazy For The Boys, LLC (CFTB), a privately held company, and certain members owning membership interest in CFTB whereby the Company acquired certain assets from CFTB in exchange for 5,201,500 shares of the Companys common stock. The assets that were acquired included a movie screenplay, master recordings, trademarks, and web domain names (the CFTB Assets).\nOn December 7, 2016, the Company organized a subsidiary in the state of Nevada, Crazy for the Boys Movie, LLC (CFTB Movie) which was created for the sole purpose of financing, producing and commercially exploiting (via all distribution sources and other means of revenue generation) one feature-length motion picture as a coming of age, musical dramedy, entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys) and all of its allied, ancillary, subsidiary and merchandising rights. The Company is the Managing Member of CFTB Movie and will have the sole and exclusive right to operate CFTB Movie. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company owns approximately 70% of CFTB Movie, the Companys majority owned subsidiary.\nIn May 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement with Crazy for the Boys GA LLC (CFTB GA), a company organized in the state of Georgia, whereby CFTB GA assigned and transferred all ownership, asset rights and other interest in CFTB GA to CFTB Movie. CFTB GA was created for the sole purpose of producing the Movie in the State of Georgia, in the city of Savannah, which offers production incentives up to 30% of Georgia production expenditures in transferable tax credits. The Georgia tax incentive program is available for qualifying projects, including feature films, television series, commercials, music videos, animation and game development. Consequently, CFTB GA became a wholly owned subsidiary of CFTB Movie and as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CFTB GA. Filming for the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. The Company started to screen the movie in January 2019 for potential buyers. The Company had received several offers for the distribution of the film and the Company continues to review any offers.\nAll For One Media Corp. is in the business of targeting the lucrative tween demographic across a multitude of entertainment platforms. The Companys primary business objective is to embark on creating, launching and marketing original pop music groups, commonly referred to as boy bands and girl groups, by utilizing both traditional and social media models. All For One Media owns over fifty completed professionally produced master recordings, as well as a full-length motion picture entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys) (the Film) that is ready for release. This musical comedys backstory creates a fictional girl group by the name of Drama Drama, and the Company intends to launch a new girl group with the same name simultaneous to the release of the Film.\nThe Company expects to generate revenues from movie receipts, sales, downloads and streaming of original recorded music, videos, motion pictures, music publishing, live performances, licensed merchandise and corporate sponsorships.\nOn January 17, 2020, our parent entity, entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with, our subsidiary, Carmel Valley Productions Inc. whereby the Company sold 90% of its 100% interest in CVPI and any of the Companys right to receive revenues or repayment from the $100,000 advance on film rights under the terms of the Co-Production and Finance Agreement dated on July 24, 2019, for a total purchase price of $50,000.\nOn February 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Quiver Distribution RB USA, Inc (Quiver) to distribute (Distribution Agreement) our full-length PG13-rated feature film, Drama Drama, (formerly with a working title of Crazy For the Boys). Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, rights for all forms of VOD (including but not limited to transactional, subscription and advertising), EST, television, non-theatrical were given to Quiver and all other rights were reserved to the Company including ad-free Youtube rights. In addition, after Quiver has deducted its distribution fee and recouped 100% of its actual, direct, arms-length expenses (distribution expenses), 100% of the backed participation shall go to the Company. Further, Quiver shall earn a distribution fee of 20%, increasing to 30% once Quiver has returned $400,000 to the Company. As of September 30, 2022, Quiver had not yet recouped their distribution expenses and we have not realized any revenue.\nThe film, Drama Drama, was released on June 1, 2021, available across all major platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Vudu, Fandango Now, Comcast, Cox, Spectrum, DirectTV, and Dish, among others.\nThis first window in the release process was SVOD (Streaming) as discussed above and the second window the release process will be by International Sales, Cable and Broadcast TV. In addition, the Drama Drama Official Soundtrack has been released through all major music streaming platforms on May 18, 2021, including Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\nAs previously discussed, Drama Drama, the motion picture, has tested well with our target tween and teen demographic in its own right, but has also been designed to serve as a 100-minute launch vehicle for Drama Drama, the girl group.\nOur goal is to generate revenues related to the Drama Drama franchise from the movie, music, merchandising, live concert performances, and additional sources.\nWe are currently exploring opportunities to expand the Drama Drama brand and has held several talks about a short or long form sequels well as new Drama Drama recordings and Music Videos. In FY 2022, the Company released the song and Dance Video Snoochie Boochie which was written by Billboard award winning song writer Sam Hollander and produced by multi-platinum producer Rob Grimaldi.\nThe Company plans on introducing a new music platform in 2023 with the release of two new singles and accompanied by Music Videos.\nIn addition, the Company is developing a new Screen Play, with the expectation that it will be produced in FY 2023 and completing a sizzle reel for the Dream Street documentary which will be released in Q2 2023.\nResults of Operations\nComparison for the Years Ended September 30, 2022, and 2021:\nNet Revenues\nThe Company principally engaged in content development of media targeted at the tween demographic consisting of children between the ages of seven and fourteen.\n\u00b7\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we generated minimal revenues of $8,993 from streaming music sales.\n\u00b7\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we generated minimal revenues of $9,493. from streaming music sales.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, operating expenses consisted of the following:\nFor Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\nCompensation expense\n$ 96,062\n$ 96,238\nProfessional and consulting expense\n196,268\n110,992\nLicense fees\n-\n160,003\nGeneral and administrative expense\n241,535\n251,712\nTotal\n$ 533,865\n$ 618,945\nCompensation expense:\n\u00b7\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, compensation expense decreased by $176, or less than 1%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.

We had a working capital deficit of $15,587,845 and cash of $98,612 as of September 30, 2022, and a working capital deficit of $18,491,425 and cash of $101,431 as of September 30, 2021.\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nPercentage\nChange\nWorking capital deficit:\nTotal current assets\n$ 105,475\n$ 122,622\n$ (17,147 )\n(14.0 )%\nTotal current liabilities\n(15,693,320 )\n(18,614,047 )\n2,920,727\n15.7 %\nWorking capital deficit:\n$ (15,587,845 )\n$ (18,491,425 )\n$ 2,903,580\n15.7 %\nThe decrease in working capital deficit was primarily attributable to a decrease in current assets of $17,147 and a decrease in current liabilities of $2,920,727 primarily attributable to a decrease in derivative liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $2,847,637 of gross convertible notes and $2,472,500 of gross notes payable outstanding.

We expect to require additional financing to fund our current operations for fiscal 2023. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we are unable to raise the funds required to fund our operations, we will seek alternative financing through other means, such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need for our operations from the sale of our securities. We have not located any sources for these funds and may not be able to do so in the future. We expect that we will seek additional financing in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If we fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had net income and net cash used in operations of $1,835,497 and $496,569, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $25,708,263 and working capital deficit of $15,587,845 as of September 30, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future such as selling the completed Movie and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Companys ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Companys contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include but are not limited to the fair value of common stock issued for services, the valuation of derivative liabilities, the valuation of stock-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nFair Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on September 30, 2022. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1:\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2:\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3:\nInputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, due from and to related parties, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements, which will improve the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. During the period ended March 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-13. This guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nFilm Production Costs\nThe Company capitalizes costs which were used in the production of films according to ASC 926, Entertainment - Films. For films produced by the Company, capitalized costs include all direct production and financing costs, capitalized interest and production overhead. Production overhead includes the costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of films. Production overhead does not include general and administrative expenses and marketing, selling and distribution costs. Capitalization of interest costs should generally commence when a film is set for production and end when a film is substantially complete and ready for distribution. Filming the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. Generally, the interest eligible for capitalization includes stated interest, imputed interest, and interest related to debt instruments as well as amortization of discounts and other debt issue costs.\nPursuant to ASC 926-20-35, the Company will begin to amortize capitalized film cost when a film is released, and it begins to recognize revenue from the film. These costs for an individual film are amortized and participation costs (see below) are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current years revenues bear to managements estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of such film. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture.\nParties involved in the production of a film may be compensated in part by contingent payments based on the financial results of a film pursuant to contractual formulas (participations) and by contingent amounts due under provisions of collective bargaining agreements (residuals). Such parties are collectively referred to as participants, and such costs are collectively referred to as participation costs. Participations may be given to creative talent, such as actors or writers, or to entities from whom distribution rights are licensed. Participation costs are typically recognized evenly as the ultimate revenues are earned.\nUnamortized film costs are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the film may be less than unamortized costs. Consistent with the rules for recognizing impairment of long-lived assets in ASC 926, the standard sets forth examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the entity must assess whether the fair value of the film (whether it has been completed or is still in production) is less than the carrying amount of its unamortized film costs.\n1.\nAn adverse change in the expected performance of the film prior to its release,\n2.\nActual costs substantially in excess of budgeted costs,\n3.\nSubstantial delays in completion or release schedules,\n4.\nChanges in release plans, such as a reduction in the initial release pattern,\n5.\nInsufficient funding or resources to complete the film and to market it effectively,\n6.\nActual performance subsequent to release fails to meet prerelease expectations. (ASC 926-20-35-12)\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10 - Derivative and Hedging - Contract in Entitys Own Equity. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment.\nIn July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of the ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments non-employees, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date defined as the earlier of: a) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or b) the date at which the counterpartys performance is complete.\nThe expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated, based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted and implemented on October 1, 2018, ASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 606). ASU 606 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nUpon implementation of ASU 606, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSee Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules of this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our companys reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses, which we identified, in our report on internal control over financial reporting.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Our managements evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nThe ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in our internal control over financial reporting:\n(1)\nthe lack of multiples levels of management review on complex accounting and financial reporting issues, and business transactions,\n(2)\na lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel and implementation of accounting systems, and\nWe expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services related to accounting services for the foreseeable future. We believe this will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses related to our accounting discussed above.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additional controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to SEC rules that permit us to provide only managements report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

None of our directors or officers is a director in any other reporting companies. The Company is not aware of any proceedings to which any of the Company\u201a officers or directors, or any associate of any such officer or director, is a party adverse to the Company or any of the Company\u201a subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to it or any of its subsidiaries.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nDuring the past ten years, none of our present or former directors, executive officers or persons nominated to become directors or executive officers:\n\u00b7\nhave been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences);\n\u00b7\nhad any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;\n\u00b7\nhave been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;\n\u00b7\nhave been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n\u00b7\nhave been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or have been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29)), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide us with copies of those filings.\nCode of Ethics\nThe Company does not currently have a Code of Ethics.\nCorporate Governance\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nWe presently do not have an audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, corporate governance committee or any other committee of our board of directors. Our entire Board of Directors meets to undertake the responsibilities that would otherwise be delegated to a committee of our board of directors.\nAudit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert\nWe do not have a standing audit committee at the present time. Our board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nWe believe that our board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The board of directors of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given our lack of material operations.

Information relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal shareholders and management is based upon information furnished by each person using beneficial ownership\u201a concepts under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole voting and investment power.\nThe percentages below are calculated based on 8,135,737,831 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and 51 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of December 26, 2022. We do not have any outstanding options, or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each person listed is c/o All for One Media Corp., 236 Sarles Street, Mt.

Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power and also any shares, which the individual has the right to acquire within 60 days through the exercise of any stock option or other right. The persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable and the information contained in the footnotes to this table.\n2.\nBased on 8,135,737,831 issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 26, 2022.\n3.\nBrian Lukow is a director and the Companys President. Mr. Lukows ownership includes his interests in Crazy for the Boys, LLC. Mr. Lukow owns 51 shares of preferred stock with voting rights equal to (x) 0.019607 multiplied by the total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote (the Numerator), divided by (y) 0.49, minus (x) the Numerator.\n4.\nAimee Ventura OBrien is a director and the Companys Secretary.\n5.\nBrian Lukow, the Companys President and director, is the managing member of Crazy for the Boys, LLC and owns approximately 17% of CFTB.\nSEC Rule 13d-3 generally provides that beneficial owner of securities include any person who, directly or indirectly, has or shares voting power and/or investment power with respect to such securities, and any person who has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of such security within 60 days. Any securities not outstanding which are subject to such options, warrants or conversion privileges exercisable within 60 days are treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of outstanding securities owned by that person. Such securities are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of the class owned by any other person. At the present time there are no outstanding options or warrants. ITEM 13: CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nRelated Party Transactions\nParties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal stockholders of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal stockholders of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal where one-party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as compensation or distribution to related parties depending on the transaction.\nIn October 2015, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement (the Employment Agreement) with Mr. Brian Lukow, the CEO of the Company. As compensation for his services per the terms of the Employment Agreement, the Company shall pay $5,000 per month and 20,000 shares of the Companys common stock per month calculated at $0.25 per share. The Employment Agreement may be terminated by either party upon two months written notice. On February 16, 2018, the Company amended this Employment Agreement to increase Mr. Lukows base salary from $5,000 to $8,000 per month. As September 30, 2022 and 2021, accrued salaries to Mr. Lukow amounted to $81,556 and $81,556, respectively, and was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities - related party in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIn December 2015, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tween Entertainment, executed a month-to-month operating lease agreement with the CEO of the Company. The lease premise is located in Mt. Kisco, New York and the initial term was for a period of 12 months commencing in December 2015 and expiring in December 2016. The lease is currently on a month-to-month basis. The lease requires the Company to pay a monthly base rent of $1,000. The Company has recorded rent expense of $12,000 for both periods for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 which was included as rent expense under general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued rent balance of $28,000 and $27,500, respectively, reflected under \u2018accounts payable and accrued liabilities - related party in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIn 2020, the CEO advanced to the Company $1,201 and an additional $5,316 in 2021, for a total of $6,517 for working capital purposes which is reflected as due to related parties.

As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has an accrued balance of $125,000 in accrued expenses - related party for services rendered by the CEO of the Company.\nDirector Independence\nBecause the Companys Common Stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, the Company has used the definition of independence of the NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the companys board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\u25cf\nthe director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company;\n\u25cf\nthe director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);\n\u25cf\na family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company;\n\u25cf\nthe director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipients gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);\n\u25cf\nthe director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or\n\u25cf\nthe director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Companys outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the Companys outside auditor, and who worked on the Companys audit.\nBased on this review, we have no independent directors pursuant to the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. ITEM 14: PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed to our company for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 for professional services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm, Salberg & Company, P.A.:\nYears Ended\nSeptember 30,\nFee Category\nAudit Fees\n$ 62,700\n$ 56,300\nAudit-related Fees\n-\n-\nTax Fees\n-\n-\nAll Other Fees\n-\n-\nTotal Fees\n$ 62,700\n$ 56,300\nAudit Fees\nAudit fees were for professional services rendered for the audits of our annual financial statements and for review of our quarterly financial statements during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAudit-Related Fees\nThis category consists of assurance and related services by the independent registered public accounting firm that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported above under Audit Fees.\nTax Fees\nAs our independent registered public accountants did not provide any services to us for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, no tax fees were billed or paid during those fiscal years.\nAll Other Fees\nOur independent registered public accountants did not provide any products and services not disclosed in the table above during the 2022 and 2021 fiscal years. As a result, there were no other fees billed or paid during those fiscal years.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nOur entire board of directors, which acts as our audit committee, pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by our board of directors before the respective services were rendered.\nOur board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm and believe that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining their respective independence.\nPART IV ITEM 15.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nCONTENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB Firm No. 106)\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nto\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of:\nAll For One Media Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of All For One Media Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net income and cash used in operations of $1,835,497 and $496,569, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2022. The net income was primarily the result of a gain from the extinguishment of debt and gain on debt modification. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, stockholders deficit and working capital deficit of $25,708,263, $15,725,345 and $15,587,845 as of September 30, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements Plan in regards to these matters is also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDerivative Liabilities\nAs described in Footnote 2 Derivative Liabilities and Fair Value Measurements and Footnote 5, Convertible Notes Payable to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded derivative activity during fiscal 2022 that resulted primarily in a net aggregate derivative expense of $719,842, gains on extinguishment of debt from settlement of derivative liabilities of $4,434,336 and derivative liabilities of $8,149,517 at September 30, 2022.\nWe identified the evaluation of instruments and contracts to determine whether there are derivatives to be recorded, the analysis of the accounting treatment and presentation for derivative transactions and the valuation of derivatives as critical audit matters. Auditing managements analysis of the above critical audit matters was complex and involved a high degree of subjectivity.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included (a) Reviewed and tested managements conclusions as to whether certain instruments or contracts qualified for derivative treatment by comparing managements analysis and conclusions to authoritative and interpretive literature, (b) Compared the accounting treatment and presentation to that described by the authoritative and interpretive literature, (c) Tested managements process for valuing derivatives by comparing it to generally accepted methodologies for valuing derivatives, (d) Tested managements valuation of the derivatives by testing assumptions and data used in the valuation model including the term, volatility and interest rate, and (e) Recomputed the derivative valuations. We agreed with managements conclusions and determined that the derivatives treatments were fairly stated.\n/s/ Salberg & Company, P.A.\nSALBERG & COMPANY, P.A.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nBoca Raton, Florida\nDecember 29, 2022\n2295 NW Corporate Blvd., Suite 240 Boca Raton, FL 33431-7328\nPhone: (561) 995-8270 Toll Free: (866) CPA-8500 Fax: (561) 995-1920\nwww.salbergco.com info@salbergco.com\nMember National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts Registered with the PCAOB\nMember CPAConnect with Affiliated Offices Worldwide Member AICPA Center for Audit Quality\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP.

The assets that were acquired included a movie screenplay, master song recordings, trademarks, and web domain names (the CFTB Assets).\nOn December 7, 2016, the Company organized a subsidiary in the state of Nevada, Crazy for the Boys Movie, LLC (CFTB Movie) which was created for the sole purpose of financing, producing and commercially exploiting (via all distribution sources and other means of revenue generation) one feature-length motion picture as a coming of age, musical dramedy, entitled Drama Drama (formerly with a working title of Crazy For The Boys (the Movie) and all of its allied, ancillary, subsidiaries and merchandising rights. The Company is the Managing Member of CFTB Movie and will have the sole and exclusive right to operate CFTB Movie. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company owns approximately 70% of CFTB Movie, the Companys majority owned subsidiary.\nIn May 2017, the Company entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement with Crazy for the Boys GA LLC (CFTB GA), a company organized in the state of Georgia, whereby CFTB GA assigned and transferred all ownership, asset rights and other interest in CFTB GA to CFTB Movie. CFTB GA was created for the sole purpose of producing the Movie in the State of Georgia, in the city of Savannah, which offers production incentives up to 30% of Georgia production expenditures in transferable tax credits. The Georgia tax incentive program is available for qualifying projects, including feature films, television series, commercials, music videos, animation and game development. Consequently, CFTB GA became a wholly owned subsidiary of CFTB Movie and as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of CFTB GA. Filming for the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. The Company started to screen the movie in January 2019 for potential buyers. The Company had received several offers for the distribution of the film and the Company continues to review any offers.\nOn February 2, 2022, the Company and RA Production, Inc (RA Production) (collectively as Parties) entered into an Operating Agreement with Boss Music and Entertainment, LLC (BME), a Delaware limited liability company (see Note 4 and Note 9). Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Company has 50% interest in BME and was to contribute a total of $1,000,000 towards the BME capital account payable as follows: (i) $200,000 upon signing hereof of the Operating Agreement and (ii) $800,000 payable on the full execution of recording agreements with five artists to form a recording group, (i.e. boy band). As of September 30, 2022, of the total $200,000 only $7,500 of capital contribution had been paid which was recorded as a loss on equity method investment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations since the project was abandoned (see Note 4).\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of its majority-owned and wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net loss of subsidiaries applicable to non-controlling interests.\nCash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Companys accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had not reached bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit on interest bearing accounts. To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets of $6,863 and $21,191 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consist primarily of costs paid for future services which will occur within a year. Prepaid expenses typically include prepayments in cash for consulting which are being amortized over the terms of their respective agreements.\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and expenses for the period then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include but are not limited to the recoverability of the equity method investment, fair value of common stock issued, the valuation of derivative liabilities, gains from extinguishment of debt, the valuation of stock-based compensation, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nFilm Production Costs\nThe Company capitalizes costs which were used in the production of films according to ASC 926, Entertainment - Films. For films produced by the Company, capitalized costs include all direct production and financing costs, capitalized interest and production overhead. Production overhead includes the costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of films. Production overhead does not include general and administrative expenses and marketing, selling and distribution costs. Capitalization of interest costs should generally commence when a film is set for production and end when a film is substantially complete and ready for distribution. Filming the Movie was completed in July 2017 and the post-production phase was completed in December 2018. Generally, the interest eligible for capitalization includes stated interest, imputed interest, and interest related to debt instruments as well as amortization of discounts and other debt issue costs.\nPursuant to ASC 926-20-35, the Company will begin to amortize capitalized film cost when a film is released, and it begins to recognize revenue from the film. These costs for an individual film are amortized and participation costs (see below) are accrued to direct operating expenses in the proportion that current years revenues bear to managements estimates of the ultimate revenue at the beginning of the current year expected to be recognized from the exploitation, exhibition or sale of such film. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture.\nParties involved in the production of a film may be compensated in part by contingent payments based on the financial results of a film pursuant to contractual formulas (participations) and by contingent amounts due under provisions of collective bargaining agreements (residuals). Such parties are collectively referred to as participants, and such costs are collectively referred to as participation costs. Participations may be given to creative talent, such as actors or writers, or to entities from whom distribution rights are licensed. Participation costs are typically recognized evenly as the ultimate revenues are earned.\nUnamortized film costs are tested for impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the film may be less than unamortized costs. Consistent with the rules for recognizing impairment of long-lived assets in ASC 926, the standard sets forth examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the entity must assess whether the fair value of the film (whether it has been completed or is still in production) is less than the carrying amount of its unamortized film costs.\n1.\nAn adverse change in the expected performance of the film prior to its release,\n2.\nActual costs substantially in excess of budgeted costs,\n3.\nSubstantial delays in completion or release schedules,\n4.\nChanges in release plans, such as a reduction in the initial release pattern,\n5.\nInsufficient funding or resources to complete the film and to market it effectively,\n6.\nActual performance subsequent to release fails to meet prerelease expectations. (ASC 926-20-35-12)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on September 30, 2022. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1:\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2:\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3:\nInputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, due from and to related parties, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nAssets or liabilities measured at fair value or a recurring basis included embedded conversion options in convertible debt (see Note 5) and were as follows on September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nDescription\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nDerivative liabilities\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 8,149,517\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 11,587,761\nA roll forward of the level 3 valuation financial instruments is as follows:\nFor the Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\nBalance at beginning of year\n$ 11,587,761\n$ 10,997,765\nInitial valuation of derivative liabilities included in debt discount\n276,250\n1,369,000\nInitial valuation of derivative liabilities included in derivative expense\n135,670\n1,907,509\nReclassification of derivative liabilities to gain on debt extinguishment\n(4,434,336 )\n(5,430,054 )\nChange in fair value included in derivative expense\n584,172\n2,743,541\nBalance at end of year\n$ 8,149,517\n$ 11,587,761\nASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding equity instruments.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company has certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10 - Derivative and Hedging - Contract in Entitys Own Equity. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment, or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on debt extinguishment.\nIn July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of the ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share\nPursuant to ASC 260-10-45, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of common stock issuable for stock options and stock warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future.\nThe potentially dilutive common stock equivalents as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 were included in the dilutive income (loss) per share calculation. The following were the computation of diluted shares outstanding and in periods where the Company has a net income, all dilutive securities were included.\nSeptember 30,\nCommon Stock Equivalents:\nStock Warrants\n1,600,000\n1,600,000\nConvertible Notes\n51,961,591,212\n22,115,183,123\nTotal\n51,963,191,212\n22,116,783,123\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncome (loss) per common share - basic:\nNet income (loss) attributable to All For One Media Corp.\n$ 1,860,650\n$ (3,110,176 )\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n5,962,775,675\n3,652,537,713\nNet income (loss) per common share - basic:\n$ 0.00\n$ (0.00 )\nIncome (Loss) per common share - diluted:\nNet income (loss) attributable to All For One Media Corp.\n$ 1,860,650\n$ (3,110,176 )\nAdd: interest on debt\n1,612,917\n-\nAdd: initial derivative expense\n135,670\n-\nAdd: gain on extinguishment of debt, net\n584,172\n-\nLess: gain from change in fair value of derivative liabilities\n(3,935,629 )\n-\nLess: gain debt modification\n(764,999 )\n-\nNumerator for loss from operations per common share - diluted\n$ (507,219 )\n$ (3,110,176 )\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n5,962,775,675\n3,652,537,713\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nConvertible notes payable\n51,961,591,212\n-\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n57,924,366,887\n3,652,537,713\nNet loss per common share - diluted\n$ (0.00 )\n$ (0.00 )\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes (ASC 740-10), which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.\nTax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.\nThe Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25, Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The federal and state income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS and state taxing authorities, generally for three years after they are filed. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. The Companys 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax years may still be subject to federal and state tax examination.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments non-employees, compensation expense is determined at the measurement date defined as the earlier of: a) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or b) the date at which the counterpartys performance is complete.\nThe expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The awards to consultants and other third parties are then revalued, or the total compensation is recalculated, based on the then current fair value, at each subsequent reporting date.\nNon-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-65, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). This ASC clarifies that a non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts attributed to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. In accordance with ASC 810-10- 45-21, those losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries may exceed their interests in the subsidiarys equity. The excess and any further losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest shall be attributed to those interests even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance. During the year ended September 30, 2017, the Company sold 8 Class A units of membership interest in CFTB Movie and assigned 1 Class B unit in CFTB Movie pursuant to a guarantee agreement which resulted in approximately 27% non-controlling interest. On November 14, 2018, the Company sold 1and \u00bc Class A units of membership interest in CFTB Movie to a director of the Company for $125,000 increasing the non-controlling interest to approximately 29.9%. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a non-controlling interest balance of $(400,173) and $(375,020), respectively, in connection with the majority-owned subsidiaries, CFTB Movie and CFTB GA as reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $25,153 and $5,294 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nEquity Method Investment\nThe Company accounts for investments in which the Company owns more than 20% or has the ability to exercise significant influence of the investee but the investee does not qualify for consolidation, using the equity method in accordance with ASC Topic 323, Investments-Equity Method. Under the equity method, an investor initially records an investment in the stock of an investee at cost and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investors share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition. The amount of the adjustment is included in the determination of net income by the investor, and such amount reflects adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated statements including adjustments to eliminate intercompany gains and losses, and to amortize, if appropriate, any difference between investor cost and underlying equity in net assets of the investee at the date of investment. The investment of an investor is also adjusted to reflect the investors share of changes in the investees capital. Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred which is other than temporary, and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value is in excess of what would otherwise be recognized by application of the equity method (see Note 4).\nIn accordance with ASC 323-10-35-20 through 35-22, the investor ordinarily shall discontinue applying the equity method if the investment (and net advances) is reduced to zero and shall not provide for additional losses unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. An investor shall, however, provide for additional losses if the imminent return to profitable operations by an investee appears to be assured. For example, a material, nonrecurring loss of an isolated nature may reduce an investment below zero even though the underlying profitable operating pattern of an investee is unimpaired. If the investee subsequently reports net income, the investor shall resume applying the equity method only after its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended.\nEquity method investments are classified as investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company periodically evaluates its equity and cost method investments for impairment due to declines considered to be other than temporary. If the Company determines that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, then a charge to earnings is recorded as an impairment loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 606), the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company recognized revenue of $8,993 and $9,493 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from streaming music sales. The Company markets their master song recordings through online music streaming websites and recognizes revenues on a net basis once the songs are downloaded by the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entitys Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The new ASU addresses issuers accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. This amendment is effective for all entities, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-04 during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging-Portfolio Layer Method. Current GAAP permits only prepayable financial assets and one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of prepayable financial instruments to be included in a last-of-layer closed portfolio. The amendments in ASU 2022-01 allow 3 non-prepayable financial assets also to be included in a closed portfolio hedged using the portfolio layer method. That expanded scope permits an entity to apply the same portfolio hedging method to both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets, thereby allowing consistent accounting for similar hedges.\nThe amendments in ASU 2022-01 clarify the accounting for and promote consistency in the reporting of hedge basis adjustments applicable to both a single hedged layer and multiple hedged layers as follows:\n1.\nAn entity is required to maintain basis adjustments in an existing hedge on a closed portfolio basis (that is, not allocated to individual assets).\n2.\nAn entity is required to immediately recognize and present the basis adjustment associated with the amount of the dedesignated layer that was breached in interest income. In addition, an entity is required to disclose that amount and the circumstances that led to the breach.\n3.\nAn entity is required to disclose the total amount of the basis adjustments in existing hedges as a reconciling amount if other areas of GAAP require the disaggregated disclosure of the amortized cost basis of assets included in the closed portfolio.\n4.\nAn entity is prohibited from considering basis adjustments in an existing hedge when determining credit losses.\nFor public business entities, amendments in ASU 2022-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted on any date on or after the issuance of ASU 2022-01 for any entity that has adopted the amendments in ASU 2017-12 for the corresponding period. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, the effect of adopting the amendments related to basis adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (that is, the initial application date). The Company early adopted ASU 2022-01 during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net income (loss) of $1,835,497 and $(3,115,470) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in operations of $496,569 and $660,935, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net income for the year ended September 30, 2022, was primarily a result of the non-cash gain from extinguishment of debt of $3,935,629, loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities and initial derivative expense of $719,842, and non-cash gain on debt modification of $764,999. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $25,708,263, working capital deficit of $15,587,845 and a stockholders deficit of $15,725,345 as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $2,847,637 of gross convertible notes and $2,472,500 of gross notes payable outstanding. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future such as selling the completed Movie and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Companys ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Companys contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations.\nALL FOR ONE MEDIA CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect.\nNOTE 4 - EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nThe Company accounts for investments in which the Company owns more than 20% or has the ability to exercise significant influence of the investee, using the equity method in accordance with ASC Topic 323, Investments-Equity Method. Under the equity method, an investor initially records an investment in the stock of an investee at cost and adjusts the carrying amount of the investment to recognize the investors share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition.
