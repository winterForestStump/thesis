    "content": "Item 1. Business\nHistory\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the name Asteriko Corp. Our prior business plan, which generated limited or no earnings, included interior decorating products, and a travel and tourism service. On May 14, 2018, our current Chairman, President and director, Richard Carey, acquired approximately 62.15% ownership of the Company, constituting a change of control transaction. On January 6, 2017, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation, effecting the change of its name to Star Alliance International Corp. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company does not have subsidiaries.\nTroy Acquisition\nOn August 13, 2019, the Company acquired the assets of Troy Mining Corp, a Nevada corporation pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated June 13, 2019 (the Troy Asset Acquisition), which included 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 4800 acres, located east/southeast of El Portal, California, in Mariposa County, together with all of Troys rights to related equipment and buildings currently located on the mining claims, including a production processing mill together with associated buildings, all the mining and support equipment at the Troy mine site, all the Troy mining claims, and related geological reports relating to the property, assay reports on the property, and all core drilling samples. In consideration for the Troy Asset Acquisition, the Company issued to Troy a promissory note in principal amount of $500,000 (the Purchase Note), and 1,883,000 shares of a Series B Preferred Stock. The Purchase Note was repaid in full in April, 2022. The Company is currently working with the US Forest Service, National Park Service and BLM to finalize the permits to reopen the mine. No permits have been issued yet. The Company expects to restart mining operations in 2024.\nShare Purchase Agreements with Juan Lemus for the proposed acquisitions of 51% ownership in Commsa and Lion Works.\nOn December 15, 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder of Commsa. The Share Purchase Agreement contemplated the acquisition by the Company of 51% of the share capital of Commsa, a newly-formed company, which has the mining rights to five operating mines that run along a 12.5-mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River, in consideration for $1,000,000 in cash and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Mr. Lemus (the Commsa Acquisition). In addition, the Company has agreed to provide up to $7,500,000 in working capital to expand the mining operations in a gold mining project (Rio Jalan Project) in Olancho state in the highlands of Central Honduras. The Company did not meet its obligations for the consummation of the Commsa Acquisition by March 31, 2022 as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement; however, the parties did not terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, intending that the Company would be able to obtain the necessary funding later and to consummate the Commsa Acquisition.\nOn August 14, 2023, the Company and Juan Lemus executed an addendum to the Share Exchange Agreement (the which provided for the extension of the Companys obligations to pay $1,000,000 in cash, the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Mr. Lemus and the payment of $7,500,000 in working capital until September 30, 2023. The first addendum provides that if the Company does not comply with these obligations set forth in the Addendum until September 30, 2023, the Share Purchase Agreement will be null and void. On September 28, 2023, the parties executed the second addendum, extending the timing of the Companys payment from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023.\nOn March 19, 2023, the Company entered into and executed a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with Lion Works and Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder of Lion Works, which contemplated the acquisition by the Company, as Buyer, from Mr. Lemus, as Seller, of 51% of the capital stock of Lion Works, including 51% of the intellectual property rights and know-how related to the Genesis extraction system (Genesis), The Share Purchase Agreement superseded the terms of the binding Letter of Intent that the parties entered into on November 21, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Companys consideration for the acquisition of 51% of Lion Works consists of the following:\n\u00b7 The total purchase price of $5,100,000 in cash, with the first minimum payment in the amount of $2,550,000 to be paid by September 30, 2023, and the remaining outstanding balance of $2,550,000 to be paid by September 30, 2024, within 12 months of the first payment.\n\u00b7 The Company will invest an additional 5,000,000 as a working capital toward the development of the Genesis plants, with $2,000,000 to be paid by July 31, 2023, and the remaining $3,000,000 to be paid by July 31, 2024, within 12 months of the first payment.\n\u00b7 The Company will engage a patent attorney and pay for the cost of that patent attorney to prepare the patent application related to Genesis and to register that patent, provided that Lion Works will engage an expert to prepare a report on the Genesis system, to be used in this patent application.\nThe parties agreed that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement will occur on or before March 19, 2023 or at such other time and place as the Buyer and the Seller may agree, provided that (i) the Seller receives the first tranche of working capital funds in the amount of $2,000 prior to the execution and delivery of (i) the paperwork necessary for the attorney to complete the patent submission, (ii) all documentation necessary for the buyer to market the Genesis program, (iii) any other document, certificate or instrument to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 21, 2023, Juan Lemus and the Company executed the first addendum to the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Companys obligations to pay $2,000,000 as working capital was extended until September 30, 2023, and the parties agreed that upon such payment and the first minimum payment in the amount of $2,550,000 toward the total purchase price on or prior to September 30, 2023 by the Company, the parties will close the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement, and Lion Works will become a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. On September 28, 2023, the parties executed the second addendum, which extended the terms of the Companys payments to December 31, 2023.\nPurchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Keystone.\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company entered into and executed the Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement with Keystone, pursuant to which the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct Keystone, an unrelated third party, to purchase up to 75,000,000 shares of its Common Stock (the Shares), pursuant to separate purchase notices to be delivered by the Company to Keystone from time to time (each, a Purchase Notice). The Purchase Agreement provides that each Purchase Notice may be for not less than $20,000 and not more than $75,000 worth of the Companys Common Stock. The price per share of Common Stock shall be eighty-five percent (85%) of the average of the closing prices per share of the Companys Common Stock for five (5) trading days preceding the purchase.\nOur ability to require Keystone to purchase the Shares under the Purchase Agreement is subject to various limitations and conditions, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 The Company shall have performed, satisfied and complied in all material respects with all covenants, agreements and conditions required by the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement to be performed, satisfied or complied with by the Company;\n\u00b7 The Company shall deliver to Keystone on the Commencement Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) the compliance certificate executed by the Companys executive officer\n\u00b7 The initial registration statement, which covers the resale by Keystone of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), including the Commitment Shares and the shares to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Notice, shall have been declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC, and Keystone shall be permitted to utilize the prospectus therein to resell (a) all of the Commitment Shares and (b) all of the Shares included in that prospectus\n\u00b7 The applicable purchase price for each Purchase Notice must be not less than $0.01 per share\n\u00b7 At least five (5) trading days must have passed since the last Purchase Notice\n\u00b7 The Companys Common Stock must be DWAC eligible\n\u00b7 Keystones beneficial ownership of the Companys common stock is limited such that Keystone may not purchase shares of Stars common stock to the extent that, immediately following such purchase, Keystone would own more than 4.99% of Stars total issued and outstanding common stock.\n\u00b7 Selling Stockholder shall have received an opinion from our outside legal counsel in the form previously agreed to.\n\u00b7 Trading of the Companys Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the SEC, the Trading Market or the FINRA\nIn consideration for Keystone entering into the Purchase Agreement and to induce Keystone to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue to Keystone 1,000,000 Commitment Shares (as defined below). In addition, the Company agreed to provide Keystone with certain registration rights with respect to the Commitment Shares, and additional shares, including 500,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued to Keystone on the date the initial registration statement is declared effective, and 2,274,588 shares of the Companys Common Stock having an aggregate dollar value of $75,000 upon the investment by Keystone of more than $500,000 in the Company under the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the Additional Shares). The Commitment Shares issued and the Additional Shares that may be issued to Keystone pursuant to the Purchase Agreement were issued and will be issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the foregoing conditions or any other conditions under the Purchase Agreement or that we will be able to draw down any portion of the amounts available under the Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, on June 15, 2023, we filed the registration statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-272671), as amended on August 28, 2023, to register for resale by Keystone up to 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock that may purchase under the Purchase Agreement (the Initial Registration Statement). The effectiveness of the Initial Registration Statement is a condition precedent to our ability to sell shares of our Common Stock to Keystone under the Purchase Agreement. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Initial Registration Statement or file a new registration statement, to cover all of such Registrable Securities, subject to any limits that may be imposed by the SEC pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nWe qualify as a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are an exploration-stage company that focuses on acquisition and development of gold mining and other mining properties worldwide, environmentally safe technologies both in mining and other business areas. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not commenced our mining operations. We anticipate starting our mining operations in 2024. We are also exploring acquisitions of assets or majority interests in companies related to artificial intelligence technology and in the fintech arena acquiring proprietary software technology. At this time, the Company is negotiating the terms of these potential acquisitions and once these terms are finalized, we will enter into one or more definitive agreements.\nThe Company requires substantial funding and additional work to implement its business plan with respect to its mining properties, including the acquisitions of 51% ownership in both (a) Compania Minera Metalurgica Centro Americana, a Honduran Corporation (Commsa). and (b) Lion Works Advertising, SA, a Guatemalan corporation (Lion Works), a company that owns the Genesis ore extraction process, as described below. If we complete these acquisitions and acquire the intellectual property rights to Genesis, we will grow our business and will be able to build a number of Genesis plants that can be placed in customer mining sites including our own Troy mining site. After we complete these acquisitions, we also need to purchase the equipment necessary and obtain a final mining permit, to start operation in Honduras and to use Genesis technology.\nAcquisition Strategy\nOur acquisition strategy is to acquire gold mining and other mining properties worldwide, environmentally safe technologies both in mining and other business areas that will help us to grow and to enhance our overall monetization strategy. Particularly, the Company is focused on the acquisition of companies or majority interests in companies that are employing highly specialized, environmentally safe and patented technologies for the extraction of gold, silver and other metals including lithium and rare earth elements with an additional focus on biodegradable technologies that will dramatically improve many everyday applications.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we are also exploring acquisitions of assets and majority interests in companies related to artificial intelligence technology and in the fintech arena. We are currently negotiating the terms of these potential acquisitions and once these terms are final, we will enter into one or more definitive agreements.\nTroy Asset Acquisition\nAs a result of the Troy Asset Acquisition, the Company acquired 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 1600 acres, located east/southeast of El Portal, California, in Mariposa County, together with all of Troys rights to related equipment and buildings currently located on the mining claims, including a production processing mill together with associated buildings, all the mining and support equipment at the Troy mine site, all the Troy mining claims, and related geological reports relating to the property, assay reports on the property, and all core drilling samples.\nThe federal government became involved in the gold mine when prosecuting the then owner and made a request of Dr. Robert B. Garcia to place an estimated value upon the project. Mr. Garcia has a long history as a developer, owner and operator of numerous mines and mining companies and a consultant for the mining and precious metal industries. He graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in chemistry, but his vocational experience is mainly as a metallurgist. He also consults within the mining industry as an expert witness in court litigations and has served as an assay referee in large bulk precious metals purchases and evaluations of mine properties for ore values and is a Board of Directors member of a Swiss Bullion License, duly appointed and registered with the Swiss Government which is why the federal government chose him as its consultant for this project. Mr. Garcias testimony under oath to the court on behalf of the federal government were significant and resulted in Stars acquisition of the mine from the current owners.\nThis valuation was prepared on August 5, 2004, and although this area has not been mined since 2002, the Company recognizes that a new Technical Report and Appraisal prepared under US current standards and regulations with extensive core drilling is needed. Management intends to use some of the funds raised from the S 1 registration to complete the drilling and updated valuation.\nThe Company is currently working with the US Forest Service, National Park Service and Bureau of land Management (BLM) to finalize the permits to reopen the mine. No permits have been issued yet. The Company expects to restart mining operations in 2024.\nPrevious Work on the Troy Claims:\nThe history of gold mining in Mariposa County dates back to placer mining by Mexicans or Californians of Spanish descent in 1848. Details concerning work in this time are limited. The discovery of lode gold in Mariposa is generally credited to Kit Carson and the discovery of the Mariposa mine in 1849; however, it is possible that the Mexicans were mining bedrock gold in Mariposa County prior to this discovery.\nSubsequent to this discovery, large portions of Mariposa County were covered by land grants issued to John Fremont (The Las Mariposas Spanish Land Grant) and the Cook Estate. Because these grants and their private administration covered much of the Mother Lode, mining and development of the area was not conducted in the same fashion as claims located on public land.\nThe 78 current mining claims registered to Troy Mining Corporation are located west/southwest of El Portal, California and are located on BLM land. The claims are accessible via California State route 140 with the prime portals located approximately two to two and one-half (2 - 2 \u00bd) miles east of Hwy 140 (based on a direct route). There is a graded dirt road that connects the portals located the greatest distance from Hwy 140 with the highway that is owned and maintained by Star. This road is approximately eight (8) miles in length due to the many required switch-backs in order to build the road into the side of the mountain. With proper maintenance, which can be accomplished by the mining company using the equipment purchased for working the mine, this road is normally passable year-round. The road is shared with the US Forest Service and National Park Service who use it to maintain visual surveillance of the area and for fire fighting access and as part hiking trails. In addition to this road, there are additional roads owned by Star that connect the main portal with additional portals located within the claim area. Further, the claims are located at what is considered to be the east base of what is commonly known as the Mother Lode gold-quartz vein system.\nBackground of the Project:\nThe Project is located at the base of the gold mother lode in one of the three major vein belts where the greatest concentration of minerals settled over the years.\nThe project consists of mining claims located upon land under the control of BLM, US Forest Service and the National Park Service not the state of California with oversight being by these three agencies.\nThis is a hard rock mining project, not an open pit or placer type project resulting in much less oversight for air pollution and visual impact.\nIt is not a start-up project; it is the reopening of an existing, recently worked, project.\nThere is an existing grid of roads and trails that crisscross the project providing access to the prime portals. The roads are graded dirt that can be maintained as passable throughout the year and the trails can be expanded into passable roads. The estimated cost to build these roads and trails today would be in excess of $10 million.\nThere is a gravity flow ball mill installed on the project that is complete from an ore introduction conveyor system and both rough and crushed ore bins with a pneumatic air hammer/blaster system, through the separation portion of the mill including water and other solutions storage tanks and circulating system and separation tables. This equipment has a replacement cost of approximately $1.8 million.\nOn site there are two self-contained generators connected to existing electrical distribution panels with an on-site replacement cost of approximately $30,000. The project has multiple production shafts (portals) that have in-shaft railroad track installed.\nThe project has sufficient timber located within the claim areas to both provide shoring material for new tunneling and if so desired, to sell the excess.\nWhile this is primarily a gold recovery project, geologists and assay reports indicate the amount of recoverable silver available in quantity is equal to that of gold which adds considerable to the bottom-line profit.\nThe company has a large library of mining history of the area and the production shafts located within the project boundaries along with extensive exploration and geology maps, reports.\nOverview of Previous Mining Operations on the Troy Claims:\nThere are three main portals (Hite Mine, Gibbs/Williams Brothers Mine and the Gold Star Mine) located within the area currently included in the Troy mining claims that have been worked from as early as 1849 to as recently as 1996 (Note: in total there are 17 portals on the property). These mines have never been worked with modern equipment but have always been worked with dynamite and pick & shovel with the ore being transported via pack mule prior to the construction of the access road. The roadway system currently in place allows for the ore to be moved via truck either to the processing mill located at the site of the main portal or to off-site locations if it should be desired to do so. All of the mining done in this area is what is known as Hardrock or below-grade, tunnel mining. The past total production from the mines located within this area is considerable. A large portion of this production was done when the price of gold was around $20 per ounce but based on todays prices this would be very significant. During the production years for these mines, the technique followed by the Hardrock miners was known as drift mining where the miner located an external outcropping and then followed the gold vein until it petered out then he moved to another outcropping location. Underground mining extended to 900 feet with development extending down to 1200 feet in depth. Elsewhere on the property, mining and development all occurred within 100 feet of the surface.\nPrevious Work on the Troy Claims:\nThe history of gold mining in Mariposa County dates back to placer mining by Mexicans or Californians of Spanish descent in 1848. Details concerning work in this time are limited. The discovery of lode gold in Mariposa is generally credited to Kit Carson and the discovery of the Mariposa mine in 1849; however, it is possible that the Mexicans were mining bedrock gold in Mariposa County prior to this discovery.\nSubsequent to this discovery, large portions of Mariposa County were covered by land grants issued to John Fremont (The Las Mariposas Spanish Land Grant) and the Cook Estate. Because these grants and their private administration covered much of the Mother Lode, mining and development of the area was not conducted in the same fashion as claims located on public land.\nMINE SUMMARY:\nThe Mother Lode is the most extensive mineral zone in the State of California. It extends from the southern part of Mariposa County to the northern part of El Dorado County, a distance of 300 miles, then extends northeast along the Sierra Nevada foothills. Some of the most famous and productive gold mines in the West are located along the length of this mineral zone. The Mother Lode Gold Belt is a long, narrow strip on the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. There is a wall-like mass of quartz that outcrops at intervals along the belt. The wide zone of parallel and discontinuous gold vein deposits is referred to as the Mother Lode System.\nMariposa County, California, has a long history of gold production from small lode and placer mining operations. The county covers part of the Sierra Nevada Mother Lode belt first discovered in the 19th century. The majority of gold production occurred prior to 1900 and was taken from mineralized quartz veins. The gold price at that time was $20.00/ounce compared to approximately $1,900 per ounce currently. The unproven production at that time would have had a value of several billion dollars if current pricing was used.\nFrom the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill on the American River on January 24, 1848 to the present, the area known as the Mother Lode Region has been one of most prolific gold producing areas in the world. In 1849, Quartz lode mining began on claims that currently make up part of the Troy Mining claims. Later this mine was one of the first to install a stamp mill, which ground the quartz ore to separate out the free gold.\nThe Troy Mining (Troy) property is specifically located geologically, at the southern end of the Mother Lode System in Central East California, Mariposa County, approximately 200 miles east of San Francisco. The property borders on the western the age of Yosemite National Park in the El Portal, California quadrangle, and is three miles southwest of the town of the El Portal, California. The mining property is bounded on the north by the Middle Fork of the Merced River and on the south by the South Fork of the Merced River. The property ranges in elevation from 1,700 feet to 5,500 feet and with workers housed on-site, can be worked year-round. The claims in each of the two main claim groups are contiguous. The maps and mine co-ordinates are included in this report. \u2026.\nThe former AT&E Company controlled approximately 10,500 acres of ground in Mariposa County, California, covering 250 mining claims. The property was acquired from AT&E in the late 90s by USA Mining and then the 79 most important claims were reinstated by Troy Mining in the early 2000s (Note: both these transactions occurred when gold was less than $300/oz). The property includes more than 50 mine portals dating back to the late 1800s or early 1900s most of which have not been located and viewed by the current owner. Because of the existence of historical mining records, nine of these mines have been characterized as former gold producing mines. Included in this list of mines is the Hite Mine. With estimated total production of at least 150,000 ounces, the Hite Mine is ranked as the fifth largest historic gold producing mine in Mariposa County.\nThe property includes the following historic recognized gold mines: Hite, (6) Hite Central, (7) Kaderitas, (8) Mexican II, and Williams Brothers. In addition, there are at least 50 additional mining portals which were, in the last 150 years, actively producing gold in unknown quantities. These mines were actively producing with pick and shovel and pack-mule. No modern equipment or scientific means of geological study have ever been employed.\nThe company has a very excellent working relation with the BLM, US Forest Service and National Park Service officials that will be involved in the projects operation.\n\u00b7 It has secured a commitment from Mark Payne and Mr. Jon Grossman to become members of its on-site management team along with the same commitment.\n\u00b7 Mark Payne attended California State University Sacramento, Bachelor of Arts Geological Sciences Program and has been an independent geological consultant since 1985. He is a California Registered Professional Geologist #7067, and a member of the American Institute of Professional Geologists. He specializes in exploration, definition and resource estimation of gold-quartz vein systems and gold deposits dominated by coarse particulate gold and has served as chief geologist for several major companies such as Emgold Mining Corp and Sutter Gold Mining.\n\u00b7 Mr. Grossman received his BS in Economics from the Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania and has been involved in the precious metal and various aspects of the mining business for more than 30 years. At one time in his career, he was Director of Investment Banking on Wall Street and has been instrumental in founding and growing several businesses including Florida Bullion Traders, Inc. One of his major assets is the fact he was the General Manager of the mining operation that was owned by Mr. Geiger and that operated the mining project during its productive period and has a hands-on/on-site knowledge of the proper operating methods for this project.\nMINE LOCATION:\nThe list attached includes the mine location sites per the original listing of the claims with the Bureau of Land Management. In addition, each mine is listed with its specific locations.\nMain Mine Site Co-Ordinates (Blue Dot)\n37\u00b03950 North; 119\u00b05231 West\nThis is the area where the mine is located.\nINDIVIDUAL

The method Troy used to stake its claims was to land-lock the area surrounding these claims in a way to prevent outside interests to stake the additional original AT&E claims. Since existing roads, trails, etc. may be expanded but no new ones constructed without further government approval, this program proved effective. Troys plan was at such time as it was ready to begin opening the various portals for production to survey and stake the additional 290+ claims facilitated by its road and trail structure that provides access to them. These additional claims together with the existing claims would provide Star with control over ~10,500 acres, 130 miles due East of San Francisco Bay.\nPhotographs of the Troy Mining Zone\nThe Mining Property, showing site buildings\nMining Property\nMining Property\nMine Shaft\nBunker\nMain Road\nMine\nMill\nMill\nMill\nMill\nMill Building\nRock Face Inside the Mine Showing Ore\nBunker\nMine Map\nInside Mine\nInside Mine\nSeveral Pictures Taken at the Mine Site late November 2019 Follow\ncommsa mining rights\nIf the Company consummates the Commsa Acquisition under the Share Purchase Agreement with Mr. Lemus, it will acquire 51% of Commsa, a Honduran Corporation, and as a part of that acquisition the Company will acquire Commsas mining rights to five mines that run near a stretch of the Rio Jalan River and are in the process of being prepared for mining production. Below is the summary of Commsa Mining Rights.\nThe environmental licenses have been obtained and exploration is ongoing. Local small mining operations are producing a minimum of 250 to 300 oz of gold per site per month while losing approximately 50% of the recoverable gold particles. We expect that our expanded operations, using modern equipment and our new Genesis program, recently acquired, should result in up to a 98% rate of recoverable gold, leading to significantly higher quantities of gold per site.\nLocated two hours from the capital city of Choluteca, Honduras, CONNSA owns the concession for unlimited exploitation, land and drill holes. The Potosi area is rugged with elevations ranging from 300m to 1050m ASL. Saprolite and quartz - rich outcrop provide often treacherous footing on steep hills. Outcrop is sparse with topographic highs being capped either by resistant quartz - veined andesites, Padre Miguel group rocks or rhyolite intrusive doming.\nHardy plants and trees populate the regions proportional to altitude, soil, and water supply. Generally, the topographically higher elevations are covered with pine forests and pine needle carpets. Lower regions, especially in stream and river drainages are covered in deciduous single canopy jungle.\nCholuteca, the fourth largest city in Honduras, has a wide range of hotels and rental dwellings as well as good supply, repair, and communications infrastructure. The city and the national capital, Tegucigalpa, are joined by 130km of the paved highway. The highway also provides access from Choluteca to Clavos Road, one of many logging and agricultural roads throughout the area. Potosi is reached by driving 50km east on the highway from Choluteca and taking the dirt road to Porteritos, a total of 1.5 hours driving time. The highway has both passenger and heavy transport capabilities.\nCholuteca is serviced by twelve daily bus runs. Daily international airline service is available to Tegucigalpa from every country while Choluteca is serviced by an airstrip capable of landing 737 sized aircraft.\nA large, skilled labor force with some mining experience, can be mobilized in most Honduran towns. The mining concessions are centered at 13 15N and 87 00Win the area of Choluteca, Honduras.\nMining and exploration history\nAt present, the Potosi area is not being mined by other than small, high-grade operations consisting of one or two local individuals. They focus upon known occurrences such as Tajo, San Antonio and, lately, San Benito with hand tools, cobbing and molinete techniques. The area has seen sporadic gold mining activity since the time of the Spanish colonists 100 hundred years ago. Within the Potosi concession, Rosario Mining performed large scale underground tunneling in the Guadaloupe, San Antonio, Guapinol, El Caballo and Tajo adits using tracked techniques of First World War vintage. Brush-overgrown roads and at least several hundred meters of tunnels, most of them collapsed, are the legacy of this earlier work. An unnamed American company did some small shafts and tunnels at Volcancito, and Jobos. No production records or plans are available.\nGeology Project\nPerhaps ten percent of the Potosi area is rock outcrop. In a macro sense the outcrop available for mapping may be broken up into two Tertiary volcanic rock groups: the Oligocene Matagalpa Formation (mainly andesitic in composition) and the Miocene Padre Miguel Group (mainly rhyolite / dacite). Matagalpa Formation rocks contain andesite flows, crystal tuffs, feldspar porphyries, basalt, and finer grained volcano-sediments unconformably overlain by the Padre Miguel rocks (rhyolitic to dacitic tuffs). Later stage rhyolite doming occurs in the San Antonio Mine area and immediately east of the San Benito occurrence. The Cerro Potosi topographic high is probably correlative to the Padre Miguel group rooks. Later stage mafic, intermediate, and felsic diking crosscut the main units. Padre Miguel rocks are invariably bleached white to pink to grey mass of devitrified and silicified rhyolite to dacite, ignimbrite or silicified breccia. White, angular metamorphosed/altered clasts are diagnostic of this occurrence at Pantaleon. Welding is observable in core.\nAt Potosi, the rock types are variations on the Matagalpa theme, except for Pantaleon, where the prime target was gold bearing epithermal quartz veining within Padre Miguel rocks. It was also hoped that the contact between the Padre Miguel and Matagalpa rocks would be a logical horizon for gold alteration zones.\nThe majority of outcrop mapped on the project is from the Matagalpa group: a flat-lying sequence of medium grained porphyritic tuff breccia of intermediate composition. Markedly porphyritic flows were mapped on surface and logged in drill holes. The size and shape of the light grey/white feldspar phenocrysts varies from millimeter to slightly less than 0,75 cm. More massive, non-porphyritic, fine-grained andesite was identified either as volcanic flow or tuffs. The Matagalpa group is predominantly subaerial with limited sections of banded, lamellar tuffs which may have been subaqueous. Pyroclastic andesite breccias are mapped and logged in all the focus zones. Heterolithic lapilli are common constituents of the lapilli tuff. Heterolithic agglomeratic andesite and medium to coarse tuff breccia is logged in the San Benito drill holes. Fine grained intermediate dykes which may be feeder dykes cut the same drill holes.\nFelsic intrusive domes are subaerial in nature. Flow banding and spherulites are common. The main target of the drilling at San Antonio and Tajo is epithermal quartz veining and attendant alteration and silicification zones.\nStructure: The principal trend mapped at San Antonio dips steeply to the north and is coincident with an east - west striking ridge. The trend is traceable on surface from San Antonio through Corales / Guadaloupe where the strike becomes more northerly, increasing from generally east-west to west-north-west (270 to 310/320). There are indications that the west-north-west striking Corales / Guadaloupe Mines exploit a second structure mirroring the Nicaraguan trough. This trend disrupts the east-west trend hosting the San Antonio structure.\nEpithermal quartz veining is evidently controlled by structurally prepared fault and fracture zones. These zones have provided the conduit for gold bearing siliceous fluids driven by felsic doming as a \"heat engine\".\nAlteration: Feldspar and clay alteration is to moderate intense in the weathering horizon and adjacent to structurally affected areas and/or within the aura of related, epithermally altered, siliceous zones. This alteration is in direct proportion to proximity of structural movement and quartz veining. The near surface feldspar phenocrysts are soft, crumbly and subhedral to anhedral in form. Sausseritization is common in core.\nHematization is ubiquitous in surface rocks due to the weathering profile created by meteoric water circulation and subsequent oxidation. Faulted and fractured rocks are also commonly hematized to varying extents.\nSilicification: All rock units have silicified intersections (usually influenced by epithermal quartz veining) although pervasive silicification has been noted on the metre scales in core and adjacent to quartz breccia zones during the mapping phase. Epidotization is part of a classic zonation especially noticeable at San Benito where pervasive epidote gives way to pyritization and finally to silicification proximal to epithermal quartz veining and associated chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, silver minerals and gold.\nSulphides / mineralization: There is a distinct correlation between the presence of sulphide presence, type, and percentages to gold mineralization as noted in zone descriptions and core logs. Sulphides are not consistent as to type or quantity between drilled zones. If indeed there is a gold pathfinder element at Potosi, it is copper. Chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, sphalerite, silver minerals (acanthite) and their oxide analogues are present in the best mineralized intersections..\nBelow is a mineral resource summary for the Clavos. The report is compiled from internationally validated exploration documentation that meets the standards set by Canadian National Instrument 43-101, (NI 43-101) and National Instrument 43-101CP, and National Instrument 43-101F1.\nClavos\n1996 sampling traverses by Entre Mares personnel (geologists Scoretz, Malfair, Cheng, Fraser and McCarthy at different times) indicated that anomalous gold was present at Clavos zone in structurally and stratigraphically favorable terrain. Then by an independent group of Geologist from Guatemala lead by Ruben Leal in 2005 and then again in 2020 further sampling from Clavos confirmed the ancient mineralized zones, as well as new potential ones and complete economics and metallurgic reports.\nThe Choluteca concessions encompass an area characterized by steep hills, rugged relief interspersed with rounded coast mountains and ridges and domes interspersed with precipitous valleys. Cliffs are not uncommon particularly along zones of structural uplift or downthrow.\nPhysiography and Climate\nClavos is steeper topographically with rhyolite doming and very steep valleys throughout the property.\nTopography varies widely from 60m on the west side to 1190m in the northeast corner of the properties.\nHonduras is subject to temperatures ranging from the low 20's into the 40's (degrees Celsius) dependent upon the season. Climate is logically broken up into extremes: the rainy season (June to October) and the dry season (November to May).\nPotosi\nLocation and access\nThe Potosi Project is in the Municipality of Concepcion de Maria in southern Honduras, Department of Choluteca.\nMap 2855-IV (Concepcion de Maria - Cinco Pinos, 1:50,000 topographic sheet) covers most of the property. The nearest center of commerce is Choluteca, the fourth largest city in Honduras.\nAccess to Potosi is best achieved from the San Francisco turn-off on the Pan American Highway east of Choluteca. A 1.5-hour journey from Choluteca by 4x4 to the village of Porteritos via highway and dirt road is the most efficient means of travel.\nPhysiography\nThe Potosi area is rugged with elevations ranging from 300m to 1050m ASL. Saprolite and quartz - rich outcrop provide often treacherous footing on steep hills.

Fine grained intermediate dykes which may be feeder dykes cut the same drill holes.\nThe main target of the drilling at San Antonio and Tajo is epithermal quartz veining and attendant alteration and silicification zones.\nDrilling at the Tajo showing delineated a quartz vein structure striking WNW and dipping moderately to the northeast. Diamond drill holes PT97-05 to PT97-11 intersected the structure along a strike length of 150m over a 125m down dip extension.\nThe Tajo Showing is located on a variably dipping (15-30o) north-east facing slope. The Tajo structure was approached through a series of short drill holes. The structure was pierced repeatedly at anticipated depths based on a 295o strike and -35o N dip; except in PT97-11 where the vein was intercepted 20m higher in the hole. This may be explained by a swing in the strike to the northwest or an offset through faulting. Field evidence indicates that the structure begins to strike 315o on the western end of the grid. The best assay was in PT97-7 (2.29g/T over 8.0m including a core zone of 12.2g/T over 1.4m). it is geometrically demonstrable that the core zone corresponds to the base metal rich sulfide intervals of the Tajo vein.\nSan Antonio\nThe San Antonio zone was the first structure mapped and drilled during the program. The surface mapping showed altered porphyritic and a site overlying a more massive unit of andesite tuff / lapilli tuff. 1:1000 scale surface mapping and diligent sampling of all promising areas was performed on and off the grid. The underground mapping indicated that the San Antonio Mine topographically overlaps the Todos Santos Mine in Rosario Mining's earlier attempt to mine the San Antonio structure.\nFrom 2004 to 2005 12 new drills were performed by Ruben Leal at San Antonio to prove gold reserves and extend the anomalous underground samples and DDH 94-5 mineralization.\nSan Benito\nAn approximately 700 x 350m zone has been sampled with highly anomalous Au values obtained. It is open to both east and west and appears to represent stacked epithermal quartz zones with Au, Ag and Cu mineralization. Another hole to the west of the Vespa Pit, possibly drilling under the chimney zone would be useful in extending mineralization; a hole should be drilled to test the eastward extension of the chalcopyrite-bearing quartz veins mapped there. Surface samples in pits and trenches returned more than 10g/T Au values. A program of at least five, 100m drill holes would be necessary to properly test the very wide and persistent zone of base metal and gold enhancement within silicification and quartz veining identified on the grid.\nCerro Copal\nLithology of Cerro Copal is the same as Tajo.\nFrom 1999 to this day this area is also being mined on a small scale by locals following high gold grades. Ending with complex underground structure that allows us to create a 3D without drilling.\nThis new exploration area follows the Limons trend from Nicaragua Gold belt.\nLion Works, Inc.-Genesis Ore Extraction Process\nOn March 19, 2023, the Company, as Buyer entered into that certain share purchase agreement with J. Lemus, as Seller which contemplated acquisition of 51% of the capital stock of Lion Works, including 51% of the intellectual property rights and know-how related to the Genesis proprietary system (Genesis). This green, environmentally friendly, process, extracts up to 98% of the minerals, including gold and many rare earth elements from Oxide and complex Ores. Furthermore, the process takes 12 - 48 hours which is considerably shorter than the 40 to 120 days other leaching processes take. Furthermore, the heap leaching process, as a general rule only extracts up to 70% of the gold or other minerals from the ore. If left for one to two years it is possible to extract up to 90% of the minerals from the ore using heap leaching methods and compared to CIL plant processing has the same effectiveness without the cost. CIL stands for carbon in leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks or reaction vessels so that leaching and absorption take place in the same tanks. It is the most commonly used leaching process for the extraction of gold. This process has a higher capital and operating cost but generally has an improved gold recovery of between 20 and 30%. However, this process is still more expensive than our Genesis system, is environmentally unfriendly, is still slow compared to Genesis and in the first 4 to 6 months extracts much less ore than our Genesis system achieves over 12 to 48 hours.\nGenesis is the key process that makes economically unviable deposits around the world viable and profitable again.\nGenesis is a sustainable extraction method, that yields an improved recovery rate in a much shorter time period even where the presence of gold is as little as 0.10 parts per million. There are no emissions, and the system is environmentally friendly.\nUpon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Lion Works will become the Companys majority-owned subsidiary (the Lion Works Acquisition), the Company intends to have independent geologists and engineers review the two different systems and write reports on the process. This will be another use of the funds raised though the S-1 registration and funding process.\nThe Genesis Oxide System\nThe Genesis system accelerates the rate of dissolution of gold to nearly an immediate rate, therefore reducing the standard time of extraction from approximately 40-120 days to a few hours Consequently, the costs of production are dramatically reduced. The system is scalable and the smaller units are modular and can easily be transported from location to location.\nBeyond the economic advantages it also provides immediate technical solutions to difficulties caused by fine materials and resolves the need to agglomerate. The speed of extraction of gold is up to 400 times faster than conventional heap leaching.\nVersatility\nAt the heart of the Genesis system is a reactor module that makes the system versatile in its relationship with installation, construction, and repositioning. The systems conception, design, and its structural development is the innovative solution to older methods of extraction. In addition to the numerous international collaborations it has resulted in the creation and implementation of Genesis for the provision of a practical and economical solution that is effective, feasible, and reliable; characteristics which the mining industry has always required.\nThe area needed to operate a complete module is merely 2,500 square meters which includes the absorption plant, a convenient reduction in space requirements as compared to Heap leaching.\nThe Genesis Refractory System\nThe Genesis Refractory system works on complex ores. This genesis system has a very significant transformation rate from double refractory lock gold into free oxide gold. The system operates within a processing time of just a few hours, thereby reducing very significantly the time that a heap leaching system would take.\nThe Genesis system is the only economically feasible solution for complex low-grade deposits and the only Cost-effective process to treat double refractory gold and other minerals.\nThis system like the Genesis oxide system is an innovative solution that significantly improves the older methods. It is environmentally safe, has no emissions and its speed of extraction is very cost effective. The true benefits are that it can be used on tailing piles, extracting in most instances more minerals than was originally extracted with the older methods. It also cleans up these tailing piles during the extraction process leaving smaller rocks and gravel that can be used on roads and rail tracks etc. The dirtiest of all tailings are coal tailings and our equipment works very efficiently on these tailings extracting minerals and leaving useable rock residue.\nKey Points:\n\u00b7 Lower capital investment needs in comparison to the standard processes available in the industry.\n\u00b7 System is much faster than regular heap leaching methods.\n\u00b7 Improved rate of extraction.\n\u00b7 Solution for low gold grade deposits.\n\u00b7 Solution for economically unviable deposits.\n\u00b7 Genesis has the same efficiency as a CIL plant without the costs.\n\u00b7 Reduced cost of production as compared with standard methods of extraction.\n\u00b7 Environmentally friendly process\n\u00b7 Modular structure system\n\u00b7 Easy to scale\n\u00b7 the smaller units are mobile, designed to be easily transported without any secondary costs\n\u00b7 Easy to adapt and displace in complicated terrains\n\u00b7 Option to substitute cyanide for a green chemical agent\n\u00b7 Lower cost of production per ounce\n\u00b7 The construction of processing plant from scratch would require under 6 months\n\u00b7 Capacity for complete automation\n\u00b7 Precise control and measurement of the recovery of the precious metals.\n\u00b7 Experience in managing conventional mining plants is not required for setting-up Genesis\n\u00b7 Eliminates all risk in setting-up production in under a non-explored gold-bearing zones\n\u00b7 Eliminates the need to grind the mineral ore\n\u00b7 Genesis is a closed system, eliminating the risk for spillages\n\u00b7 Considerably reduces the need for water, making it particularly viable for arid sites\n\u00b7 Water and chemical agents are all reutilized and recycled\n\u00b7 Machine has no emissions, making it very safe.\nThe Genesis system also solves the problem that mining companies may experience following the decision in 2022 of the U.S. Appellate Court for the 9th Circuit known as the Rosemont decision. In that decision the Court rules that while federal mining law allows companies to mine on federal land where economically valuable minerals are present, they are not guaranteed the right to use federal land without valuable minerals as a dumping site for the mine. The Genesis system resolves any potential issues related to the mining waste/tailings, since it not only extracts minerals from the tailings, but also cleans tailings leaving the residual as usable gravel for roads and railways.\nThe cost effectiveness of our Genesis eco-friendly system means that many closed and unprofitable mines can be operated again, due to the significant increase in profitability with the lower cost of operation than conventional methods.\nFirst Prototype of the GENESIS oxide System\nFirst Industrial Scale GENESIS Refractory System\nOur Growth Strategies\nThe Company is planning to reopen the mining properties it acquired from Troy in 2024. to to complete the Commsa Acquisition and the Lion Works Acquisition, and to purchase the equipment necessary to start operations in Honduras and West Africa and actualize commercial production from the mines. We believe that these activities will generate revenues and profit. The Company is also exploring the acquisitions of assets and majority interests in companies with proprietary software related to artificial intelligence technology and in the fintech arena. To implement this business plan, it will require the full utilization of our management, financial and other resources and raising the funds necessary for the businesses. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to quickly scale-up operations and to recruit, train and manage operations, management, and technical personnel and to retain the current successful management team and adding experienced personnel to the team to enable us to meet our production expansion plan.\nCompetition\nThe mining business is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have. As a result, we may experience difficulty competing with other businesses when conducting development and mining activities. In addition, marketing our new technology will take time to gain traction in the mining industry. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of gold recovered from our mining properties. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. If we purchase assets and/or majority interests in companies in the fintech arena, it would be even more difficult to compete with other companies that have developed their business in this highly competitive area and have greater financial resources than we have.\nIntellectual Property\nWe currently do not have any patents or trademarks registered in the name of the Company. Upon the acquisition of 51% interest in Lion Works, we will acquire 51% in the proprietary technology owned by Lion Works, called Genesis, however this technology has not been patented, and the Company will need to engage a patent attorney to apply for the patent registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Currently, the Company uses a combination of copyright, non-registered trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect its intellectual property rights to technologies that the Company may acquire or develop.\nCompliance with U.S. Government Regulation.\nThe General Mining Law of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-54 and \u00a7\u00a7 611-615) is the major U.S. federal law governing locatable minerals. This law allows citizens of the United States the opportunity to explore for, discover, and purchase certain valuable mineral deposits on those federal lands that are open to mineral entry. The law sets general standards and guidelines for claiming the possessory right to a valuable mineral deposit discovered during exploration. The General Mining Law allows for the enactment of state laws governing location and recording of mining claims and sites that are consistent with federal law. The federal regulations implementing the General Mining Law are found at Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in Groups 3700 and 3800.\nA mining claim is a selected parcel of U.S. federal land, valuable for a specific mineral deposit or deposits, for which the claimant has asserted a right of possession under the General Mining Law. All rights to the Star Alliance International Corp. Claims are restricted to the exploration and extraction of a mineral deposit. The rights granted by a mining claim protect against a challenge by the United States and other claimants only after the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit. The two types of mining claims are lode and placer. The Star Alliance International Corp. Claims are lode claims. Lode claims cover classic veins or lodes having well-defined boundaries and also include other rock in-place bearing valuable mineral deposits. Lode claims are usually located as parallelograms with the side lines parallel to the vein or lode. The end lines of the lode claim must be parallel to qualify for underground extralateral rights. Extralateral rights involve the rights to minerals in vein or lode form that extend at depth outside the vertical boundaries of the claim. The Star Alliance International Corp. Claims are a mixture of patented and unpatented mining claims. A patented mining claim is one for which the federal government has conveyed title, making it private land. Since October 1, 1994, the BLM has been prohibited by acts of Congress from accepting any new mineral patent applications.\nGenerally, all claimants must pay an annual maintenance fee per claim or site to the BLM, or file for a waiver from payment of fees by September 1 of each year. Failure to file for a waiver or pay the fee by September 1 results in the claim or site becoming forfeited by operation of law. Assessment work is work or labor performed that develops the claim for production (43 CFR Part 3836). Geological, geophysical, and geochemical surveys may qualify as assessment work for a limited period. Use of these surveys requires the filing of a detailed report, including basic findings.\nState laws also require the annual filing of an affidavit of assessment work with the proper county if the work is performed. The filing of an affidavit of annual assessment work with both the local county office and the proper BLM State Office is required if the claimant elects to file a waiver from payment of the maintenance fees. The affidavit or proof of labor must be filed no later than December 30 following the filing of a waiver in the proper BLM State Office and in the county or borough recorders office.\nThe performance of assessment work must be within a certain period referred to as the assessment year. The assessment year begins at noon of each September 1. It ends at noon September 1 of the next year (43 CFR Part 3836). Performance of assessment work need not occur during the first assessment year of location.\nExploration and mining activities on BLM-administered land are controlled by the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior contained in 43 CFR, Subparts 3715 and 3809. We are required by these regulations to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the land. For activities other than casual use, we will be required to submit either a notice or a plan of operations. A plan of operations, which includes a reclamation plan, is required where activities involve the surface disturbance of more than 5 acres. Notices also require the submission of a reclamation plan and are submitted for exploration activities covering 5 acres or less. There is no requirement for notifying the BLM of casual use activities. Casual use activities are those that cause only negligible disturbance of public lands and resources. For example, activities that do not involve the use of earthmoving equipment or explosives may be considered casual use.\nWe will be required to reclaim any surface disturbing activity, even if the claim or site is declared abandoned and void or forfeited by the BLM. Reclamation will be required if we relinquish the claim or site to the Federal Government. The BLM requires a reclamation bond or other financial security prior to approving a plan of operations or allowing operations under a notice to proceed. Surface Management actions are processed at the local level.\nWe intend to submit a plan of operations for our planned activities on the Star Alliance International Corp. Claims to the BLM district office. The plan of operations must include appropriate environmental protection and reclamation measures and describe either the entire operation proposed or reasonably foreseeable operations and how they would be conducted, including the nature and location of proposed structures and facilities.\nThe public has the conditional right to cross mining claims or sites for recreational and other purposes and to access federal lands beyond the claim boundaries. Although claimants have a right of access to a mining claim or site across federal lands, they are not allowed to cause unnecessary or undue degradation of the surface resources. Claimants may be liable for damages if found responsible for unnecessary loss of or injury to property of the United States. We may not construct permanent structures, mobile structures, or store equipment without the prior approval of an authorized federal official.\nEmployees\nThe Company currently has three employees, Richard Carey, Anthony Anish and Weverson Correia who are our three executive officers.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The various sections of this discussion contain forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this Annual Report as well as other matters over which we have no control. See Forward-Looking Statements. Our actual results may differ materially. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this.\nOur cash balance was $4,391 as of June 30, 2023. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing funds raised from the sale of shares and borrowed from our Chairman. The Chairman has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. The borrowing is non-interest-bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.\nOur independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company continues as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $25,547,794 and working capital of $(1,609,917) as of June 30, 2023, and a net loss of $10,489,394 most of which is a non cash expense. The Company used $461,573 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2023. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies such as that we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; we can use reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; we can use exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nResults of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $978,792 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to $94,508 for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $1,815,073. The increase is due to an increase in filing fees and consulting expenses.\nProfessional fees were $142,863 for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to $144,763 for the year ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of $1,900. Professional fees consist mainly of legal, accounting and audit expense. The decrease is due to lower legal and accounting fees.\nThere was a loss on conversion of common stock for Directors compensation of $3,211,400 and officer compensation of $3,100,500 for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2,111,500 and $952,500 for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nOther income (expense)\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, we had interest expense of $308,823 and a net loss on conversion of debt of $166,799 compared to interest expense of $297,417 and loss on conversion of debt of $102,403 for the year ended June 30, 2022. In addition, there was a loss on issuance of convertible debt of $0 in 2023 compared to $575,396 in 2022. Interest expense has increased as a result of interest on notes payable that were added to the Companys liabilities and the amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible notes.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $10,489,394 compared to $11,885,609 for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nPlan of Operations\nWe expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through borrowing from related parties and others. Subsequent to the year end June 30, 2022, the Company acquired the mining claims and equipment assets of Troy Mining Corporation. We also acquired or entered into agreements to acquire other businesses during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nMaterial Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.\nPurchase of Significant Equipment\nWe do intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months subject to financing.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $25,547,794 and negative working capital of $(1,609,917) as of June 30, 2023, and a net loss of $10,489,394 most of which is non cash expense. The Company used $461,573 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2023. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $491,573 for the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the net cash used in operating activities of $739,630 for the year ended June 30, 2022. The reduction in net cash used in operating activities from 2023 to 2022 is because stock issued for services decreased during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $394,240 and $1,004,565 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOver the next twelve months, we expect our principle source of liquidity may be dependent on borrowings from related and other parties.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. The Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.\nLimited operating history and need for additional capital\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any significant revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

Cherry Street, Ste 1100\nDenver, Colorado 80246\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nStar Alliance International Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Star Alliance International Corp. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception of $25,547,794. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $10,489,394. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nblaze@griesandassociates.com\n501 S.

NATURE OF BUSINESS\nStar Alliance International Corp. (the Company, we, us) was originally incorporated with the name Asteriko Corp. in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada. The primary purpose of the Company is to acquire and develop gold mining as well as certain other mining properties worldwide, finding patented new mining technologies and proprietary technology outside the mining industry.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nThe carrying amount of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Companys notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.\nThe following table classifies the Companys liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of June 30, 2023:\nSchedule of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nAt June 30, 2023\nDescription\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nDerivative\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 1,010,145\nTotal\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 1,010,145\nAt June 30, 2022\nDescription\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nDerivative\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 689,231\nTotal\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 689,231\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $25,547,794 as of June 30, 2023. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $10,489,394, which did include $9,722,349 of non-cash expense incurred for the issuance of common stock for services, loss on conversion of preferred stock and derivatives associated with convertible debt. We used $461,573 of cash in operating activities. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 4 - AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE\nOn December 15, 2021, the Company entered into that certain share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder of Compania Minera Metalurgica Centro Americana, a Honduran Corporation (Commsa). The Share Purchase Agreement contemplated the acquisition by the Company of 51% of the share capital of Commsa, a newly-formed company, which has the mining rights to five operating mines that run along a 12.5-mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River, in consideration for $1,000,000 in cash and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Mr. Lemus (the Commsa Acquisition). In addition, the Company has agreed to provide up to $7,500,000 in working capital to expand the mining operations in a gold mining project (Rio Jalan Project) in Olancho state in the highlands of Central Honduras. The Company did not meet its obligations for the consummation of the Commsa Acquisition by March 31, 2022 as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement; however, the parties did not terminate the Share Purchase Agreement, intending that the Company would be able to obtain the necessary funding later and to consummate the Commsa Acquisition. No assets other than the cash paid and value of shares issued have been included on the Balance Sheet\nOn August 14, 2023, the Company and Juan Lemus executed a first addendum to the Share Exchange Agreement which provided for the extension of the Companys obligations to pay $1,000,000 in cash, the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Mr. Lemus and the payment of $7,500,000 in working capital until September 30, 2023. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company issued to Mr. Lemus only 200,000 shares of Common Stock and paid $75,000 toward the required $1,000,000 cash payment. On September 28, 2023, the parties executed a second addendum that extended the time of the Companys payments from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023.\nOn March 19, 2023, the Company entered into and executed a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with Lion Works Advertising, SA, a Guatemalan corporation (Lion Works) and Juan Lemus, the sole shareholder of Lion Works, which contemplated the acquisition by the Company, as Buyer, from Mr. Lemus, as Seller, of 51% of the capital stock of Lion Works, including 51% of the intellectual property rights and know-how related to the Genesis extraction system (Genesis). The Share Purchase Agreement superseded the terms of the binding Letter of Intent that the parties entered into on November 21, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Companys consideration for the acquisition of 51% of Lion Works consists of the following:\n\u00b7 The total purchase price of $5,100,000 in cash, with the first minimum payment in the amount of $2,550,000 to be paid by September 30, 2023, and the remaining outstanding balance of $2,550,000 to be paid by September 30, 2024, within 12 months of the first payment.\n\u00b7 The Company will invest an additional 5,000,000 as a working capital toward the development of the Genesis plants, with $2,000,000 to be paid by July 31, 2023 and the remaining $3,000,000 to be paid by July 31, 2024, within 12 months of the first payment.\n\u00b7 The Company will engage a patent attorney and pay for the cost of that patent attorney to prepare the patent application related to Genesis and to register that patent, provided that Lion Works will engage an expert to prepare a report on the Genesis system, to be used in this patent application.\nThe parties agreed that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement will occur on or before March 19, 2023 or at such other time and place as the Buyer and the Seller may agree, provided that (i) the Seller receives the first tranche of working capital funds in the amount of $2,000 prior to the execution and delivery of (i) the paperwork necessary for the attorney to complete the patent submission, (ii) all documentation necessary for the buyer to market the Genesis program, (iii) any other document, certificate or instrument to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement.\nOn July 21, 2023, Juan Lemus and the Company executed a first addendum to the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Companys obligations to pay $2,000,000 as working capital was extended until September 30, 2023, and the parties agreed that upon such payment and the first minimum payment in the amount of $2,550,000 toward the total purchase price on or prior to September 30, 2023 by the Company, the parties will close the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement, and Lion Works will become a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. On September 28, 2023, the parties executed a second addendum extending the time of the Companys payments from September 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023.\nNOTE 5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nLong lived assets, including property and equipment assets to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less than their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nProperty and equipment are first recorded at cost. Depreciation and is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets.\nMaintenance and repair expenses, as incurred, are charged to expense. Betterments and renewals are capitalized in plant and equipment accounts. Cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to items replaced or retired are eliminated from the related accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included as income.\nAssets stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation consisted of the following:\nSchedule of property, plant and equipment\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nMine Assets $ 450,000 $ 450,000\nTotal $ 450,000 $ 450,000\nOnce operations utilizing the property and equipment have begun, the Company will begin depreciation of the assets.\nNOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nOn August 1, 2019, the Company entered into and executed initial employment agreements with Richard Carey, John Baird and Anthony Anish. Each initial employment agreement provided that the initial term of the employment agreement has the term of 36 months starting from August 1, 2019 and continues until July 31, 2022.

Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% is being used due to the new tax law recently enacted.\nNet deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30:\nSchedule of deferred tax assets\nDeferred Tax Assets:\nNOL Carryover $ 991,300 $ 830,300\nLess valuation allowance (991,300 ) (830,300 )\nNet deferred tax assets $ - $ -\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $991,300 that may be offset against future taxable income. No tax benefit has been reported in the June 30, 2023 or 2022 financial statements; any tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that affects 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nDue to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.\nASC Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements. Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.\nThe Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nWith few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.\nNOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that no material subsequent events exist. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagements Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of June 30, 2022, the end of the year covered by this report, our management concluded its evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.\nDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nWith respect to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon our evaluation regarding the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404). Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We note the following deficiencies that management believes to be material weaknesses:\n\u00b7 The Companys lack of segregation of duties.\n\u00b7 Lack of an audit committee and independent directors\n\u00b7 Management has not established appropriate and rigorous procedures for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting. Due to limited resources and lack of segregation of duties, documentation of the limited control structure has not been accomplished.\n\u00b7 We employ policies and procedures for reconciliation of the financial statements and note disclosures, however, these processes are not appropriately documented.\n\u00b7 Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures to ensure loss of data will not occur.\nThe Company is evaluating the necessity of implementing an independent board of directors to rectify these weaknesses.\nA material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the companys financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information\nWe have no other information to disclose that was required to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 that was not reported.\nPART III Item 10.
