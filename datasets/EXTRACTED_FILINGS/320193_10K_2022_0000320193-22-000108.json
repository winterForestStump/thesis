    "content": "Item 1. Business\nCompany Background\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and sells a variety of related services. The Companys fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.\nProducts\niPhone\niPhone\u00ae is the Companys line of smartphones based on its iOS operating system. The iPhone line includes iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, iPhone SE\u00ae, iPhone 12 and iPhone 11.\nMac\nMac\u00ae is the Companys line of personal computers based on its macOS\u00ae operating system. The Mac line includes laptops MacBook Air\u00ae and MacBook Pro\u00ae, as well as desktops iMac\u00ae, Mac mini\u00ae, Mac Studio\u2122 and Mac Pro\u00ae.\niPad\niPad\u00ae is the Companys line of multipurpose tablets based on its iPadOS\u00ae operating system. The iPad line includes iPad Pro\u00ae, iPad Air\u00ae, iPad and iPad mini\u00ae.\nWearables, Home and Accessories\nWearables, Home and Accessories includes:\nAirPods\u00ae, the Companys wireless headphones, including AirPods, AirPods Pro\u00ae and AirPods Max\u2122;\nApple TV\u00ae, the Companys media streaming and gaming device based on its tvOS\u00ae operating system, including Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD;\nApple Watch\u00ae, the Companys line of smartwatches based on its watchOS\u00ae operating system, including Apple Watch Ultra\u2122, Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE\u00ae; and\nBeats\u00ae products, HomePod mini\u00ae and accessories.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 1\nServices\nAdvertising\nThe Companys advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Companys own advertising platforms.\nAppleCare\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare\u00ae brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Companys cloud services store and keep customers content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store\u00ae, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade\u00ae, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music\u00ae, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+\u00ae, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+\u00ae, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card\u00ae, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay\u00ae, a cashless payment service.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nThe Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Companys services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (R&D), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Companys success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAvailable Information\nThe Companys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Such reports and other information filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SECs website. The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Companys annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Companys references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 4 Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Companys business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Companys business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Companys total net sales. In addition, the Companys global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Companys supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Companys products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Companys suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Companys products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Companys trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Companys ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Companys financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Companys component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Companys products and services in affected areas.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Companys operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Companys control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Companys products and services, the Companys supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Companys ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Companys profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Companys business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Companys total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Companys business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Companys products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Companys products more expensive for customers, which could make the Companys products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Companys operations and supply chain and limit the Companys ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Companys operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Companys operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Companys business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Companys business.\nMany of the Companys operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Companys suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Companys control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Companys service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6\nThe Companys operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Companys business, and harm to the Companys reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Companys supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Companys products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\nThe Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property, the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Companys services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Companys business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Companys products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Companys supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers, described in The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition, above, can also affect the Companys ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8\nThe Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements. When the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Companys products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Companys business and result in harm to the Companys reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Companys products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Companys products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Companys service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Companys services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Companys products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Companys products and services, and result in harm to the Companys reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Companys markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Companys products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9\nThe Companys future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products, customers may choose not to buy the Companys products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Companys products compared to competitors platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Companys minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Companys devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Companys products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (EU) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Companys business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Companys customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Companys own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Companys customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10\nThe Companys success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Companys ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Companys future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Companys key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Companys culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Companys ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Companys products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products.\nThe Companys business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Companys or its vendors business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Companys business by, among other things, preventing access to the Companys online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Companys products. These events could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Companys business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Companys customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Companys business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Companys behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Companys stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Companys ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Companys or its vendors employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Companys or its vendors systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Companys products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Companys ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Companys retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Companys retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\nThe Companys retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Companys ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Companys business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Companys operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Companys cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Companys ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies under the heading Contingencies, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations, the Companys results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Companys ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Companys business.\nThe Companys global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Companys business by increasing the Companys costs, limiting the Companys ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Companys products and services, and requiring changes to the Companys supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Companys products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Companys employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Companys business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Companys products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Companys business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Companys control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Companys goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Companys business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Companys commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Companys platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14\nThere can be no assurance the Companys business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Companys business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Companys products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Companys products and services, and result in harm to the Companys reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Companys business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Companys compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Companys agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Companys business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Companys profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Companys products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Companys gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Companys ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Companys services; the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Companys products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Companys logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15\nThe Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Companys products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollars strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Companys investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Companys exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Companys vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Companys effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Companys stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Companys stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors, and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Companys stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nThe Companys headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (Epic) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the Northern California District Court) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and Californias unfair competition law based upon the Companys operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epics claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Companys claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Companys App Store Review Guidelines violate Californias unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations, the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022.\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal 2022 included the following:\nFirst Quarter 2022:\nUpdated MacBook Pro 14 and MacBook Pro 16, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and\nThird generation of AirPods.\nSecond Quarter 2022:\nUpdated iPhone SE with 5G technology;\nAll-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;\nAll-new Studio Display\u2122; and\nUpdated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by the Apple M1 chip.\nThird Quarter 2022:\nUpdated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, both powered by the Apple M2 chip;\niOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to the Companys operating systems; and\nApple Pay Later, a buy now, pay later service.\nFourth Quarter 2022:\niPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max;\nSecond generation of AirPods Pro; and\nApple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra.\nIn April 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased $90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.8 billion.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of the Companys outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 20\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):\n2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\nNet sales by category:\niPhone (1)\n$ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 39 % $ 137,781\nMac (1)\n40,177 14 % 35,190 23 % 28,622\niPad (1)\n29,292 (8) % 31,862 34 % 23,724\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2)\n41,241 7 % 38,367 25 % 30,620\nServices (3)\n78,129 14 % 68,425 27 % 53,768\nTotal net sales $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515\n(1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n(2)Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\n(3)Services net sales include sales from the Companys advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services.

Further information regarding the Companys reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Segment Information and Geographic Data.\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):\n2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\nNet sales by reportable segment:\nAmericas\n$ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 23 % $ 124,556\nEurope\n95,118 7 % 89,307 30 % 68,640\nGreater China\n74,200 9 % 68,366 70 % 40,308\nJapan\n25,977 (9) % 28,482 33 % 21,418\nRest of Asia Pacific\n29,375 11 % 26,356 35 % 19,593\nTotal net sales $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 33 % $ 274,515\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac.\nEurope\nEurope net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a net unfavorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during 2022.\nGreater China\nGreater China net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The strength of the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-over-year impact on Greater China net sales during 2022.\nJapan\nJapan net sales decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2022.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 22\nGross Margin\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nGross margin:\nProducts $ 114,728 $ 105,126 $ 69,461\nServices 56,054 47,710 35,495\nTotal gross margin $ 170,782 $ 152,836 $ 104,956\nGross margin percentage:\nProducts 36.3 % 35.3 % 31.5 %\nServices 71.7 % 69.7 % 66.0 %\nTotal gross margin percentage 43.3 % 41.8 % 38.2 %\nProducts Gross Margin\nProducts gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix and higher Products volume, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nServices gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to improved leverage and a different Services mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nThe Companys future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors. As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\nResearch and development\n$ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 17 % $ 18,752\nPercentage of total net sales\n7 % 6 % 7 %\nSelling, general and administrative\n$ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 10 % $ 19,916\nPercentage of total net sales\n6 % 6 % 7 %\nTotal operating expenses\n$ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 13 % $ 38,668\nPercentage of total net sales\n13 % 12 % 14 %\nResearch and Development\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and engineering program costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 23\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nOther income/(expense), net (OI&E) for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (dollars in millions):\n2022 Change 2021 Change 2020\nInterest and dividend income\n$ 2,825 $ 2,843 $ 3,763\nInterest expense\n(2,931) (2,645) (2,873)\nOther income/(expense), net (228) 60 (87)\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n$ (334) (229) % $ 258 (68) % $ 803\nThe decrease in OI&E during 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to higher realized losses on debt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity securities and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nProvision for income taxes\n$ 19,300 $ 14,527 $ 9,680\nEffective tax rate\n16.2 % 13.3 % 14.4 %\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n21 % 21 % 21 %\nThe Companys effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Companys effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.\nThe Companys effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Companys material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.\nDebt\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the Notes), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (Commercial Paper) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\nLeases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Companys other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act) was $22.0 billion, with $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24, 2022, the Companys quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Companys uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Companys reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Companys reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Companys debt.\nThe Companys investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Companys liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Companys investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Companys debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency-denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27 Item 8.

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.\nThe Companys fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Companys fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Companys fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. The Companys fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Companys Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Companys Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Companys expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (SSPs). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Companys process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Companys other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, Benefit Plans.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$ 99,803 $ 94,680 $ 57,411\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding\n16,215,963 16,701,272 17,352,119\nEffect of dilutive securities\n109,856 163,647 176,095\nWeighted-average diluted shares\n16,325,819 16,864,919 17,528,214\nBasic earnings per share\n$ 6.15 $ 5.67 $ 3.31\nDiluted earnings per share\n$ 6.11 $ 5.61 $ 3.28\nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.\nThe Companys investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date.\nThe Companys investments in marketable equity securities are classified based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations.\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\nInventories\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 35\nRestricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI).\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (OI&E) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Companys money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act).\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. The discount rates related to the Companys lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Companys incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Companys leases cannot be readily determined.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Companys reportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Companys other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Companys retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development (R&D), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Companys foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Companys term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ 102,670 $ 76,475\nInterest rate contracts\n$ 20,125 $ 16,875\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ 185,381 $ 126,918\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39\nThe gross fair values of the Companys derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nFair Value of\nDerivatives Designated\nas Accounting Hedges Fair Value of\nDerivatives Not Designated\nas Accounting Hedges Total\nFair Value\nDerivative assets (1):\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136\nDerivative liabilities (2):\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752\nInterest rate contracts\n$ 1,367 $ - $ 1,367\n(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Companys gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Companys derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Companys derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 13,378 $ 15,954\nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (18,739) $ (17,857)\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Companys cellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of September 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 40\nNote 4 - Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Companys consolidated financial statement details as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 (in millions):\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n2022 2021\nLand and buildings\n$ 22,126 $ 20,041\nMachinery, equipment and internal-use software\n81,060 78,659\nLeasehold improvements\n11,271 11,023\nGross property, plant and equipment\n114,457 109,723\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(72,340) (70,283)\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\n$ 42,117 $ 39,440\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n2022 2021\nLong-term taxes payable $ 16,657 $ 24,689\nOther non-current liabilities\n32,485 28,636\nTotal other non-current liabilities\n$ 49,142 $ 53,325\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of OI&E for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nInterest and dividend income\n$ 2,825 $ 2,843 $ 3,763\nInterest expense\n(2,931) (2,645) (2,873)\nOther income/(expense), net (228) 60 (87)\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n$ (334) $ 258 $ 803\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\nThe provision for income taxes for 2022, 2021 and 2020, consisted of the following (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$ 7,890 $ 8,257 $ 6,306\nDeferred\n(2,265) (7,176) (3,619)\nTotal\n5,625 1,081 2,687\nState:\nCurrent\n1,519 1,620 455\nDeferred\n84 (338) 21\nTotal\n1,603 1,282 476\nForeign:\nCurrent\n8,996 9,424 3,134\nDeferred\n3,076 2,740 3,383\nTotal\n12,072 12,164 6,517\nProvision for income taxes\n$ 19,300 $ 14,527 $ 9,680\nThe foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of $71.3 billion, $68.7 billion and $38.1 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 41\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2022, 2021 and 2020) to income before provision for income taxes for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows (dollars in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nComputed expected tax\n$ 25,012 $ 22,933 $ 14,089\nState taxes, net of federal effect\n1,518 1,151 423\nImpacts of the Act 542 - (582)\nEarnings of foreign subsidiaries (4,366) (4,715) (2,534)\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction (296) (1,372) (169)\nResearch and development credit, net\n(1,153) (1,033) (728)\nExcess tax benefits from equity awards\n(1,871) (2,137) (930)\nOther\n(86) (300) 111\nProvision for income taxes\n$ 19,300 $ 14,527 $ 9,680\nEffective tax rate\n16.2 % 13.3 % 14.4 %\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nAs of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):\n2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nAmortization and depreciation\n$ 1,496 $ 5,575\nAccrued liabilities and other reserves\n6,515 5,895\nLease liabilities 2,400 2,406\nDeferred revenue 5,742 5,399\nUnrealized losses 2,913 53\nTax credit carryforwards 6,962 4,262\nOther 1,596 1,639\nTotal deferred tax assets 27,624 25,229\nLess: Valuation allowance (7,530) (4,903)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net\n20,094 20,326\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nMinimum tax on foreign earnings\n1,983 4,318\nRight-of-use assets 2,163 2,167\nUnrealized gains 942 203\nOther\n469 565\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n5,557 7,253\nNet deferred tax assets $ 14,537 $ 13,073\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had $4.4 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $2.5 billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 42\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact the Companys effective tax rate. As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Companys effective tax rate.\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nBeginning balances\n$ 15,477 $ 16,475 $ 15,619\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\n2,284 816 454\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\n(1,982) (1,402) (791)\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current year\n1,936 1,607 1,347\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\n(28) (1,838) (85)\nDecreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations\n(929) (181) (69)\nEnding balances\n$ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $4.8 billion.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the State Aid Decision). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the General Court). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Courts decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 3, Financial Instruments for more information.\nNote 6 - Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.\nPayments under the Companys lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Companys operating leases were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Companys leases were $14.9 billion, $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company made $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities involving right-of-use (ROU) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion for 2022, $3.3 billion for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 43\nThe following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 (in millions):\nLease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items 2022 2021\nRight-of-use assets:\nOperating leases Other non-current assets $ 10,417 $ 10,087\nFinance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 952 861\nTotal right-of-use assets $ 11,369 $ 10,948\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,534 $ 1,449\nOther non-current liabilities 9,936 9,506\nFinance leases Other current liabilities 129 79\nOther non-current liabilities 812 769\nTotal lease liabilities $ 12,411 $ 11,803\nLease liability maturities as of September 24, 2022, are as follows (in millions):\nOperating\nLeases Finance\nLeases Total\n2023 $ 1,758 $ 155 $ 1,913\n2024 1,742 130 1,872\n2025 1,677 81 1,758\n2026 1,382 48 1,430\n2027 1,143 34 1,177\nThereafter 5,080 906 5,986\nTotal undiscounted liabilities 12,782 1,354 14,136\nLess: Imputed interest (1,312) (413) (1,725)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 11,470 $ 941 $ 12,411\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Companys lease liabilities as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 was 10.1 years and 10.8 years, respectively.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Companys common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (DERs), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.\n2014 Employee Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the 2014 Plan) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers.

The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 46\nApple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan\nThe Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the Director Plan) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Companys non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Companys common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to Director Plan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9, 2021.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase the Companys common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods.

Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible earnings, subject to applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits. The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employees contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employees eligible earnings.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Companys RSU activity and related information for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows:\nNumber of\nRSUs\n(in thousands)\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue Per RSU Aggregate\nFair Value\n(in millions)\nBalance as of September 28, 2019 326,068 $ 42.30\nRSUs granted\n156,800 $ 59.20\nRSUs vested\n(157,743) $ 40.29\nRSUs canceled\n(14,347) $ 48.07\nBalance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58\nRSUs granted\n89,363 $ 116.33\nRSUs vested\n(145,766) $ 50.71\nRSUs canceled\n(13,948) $ 68.95\nBalance as of September 25, 2021 240,427 $ 75.16\nRSUs granted\n91,674 $ 150.70\nRSUs vested\n(115,861) $ 72.12\nRSUs canceled\n(14,739) $ 99.77\nBalance as of September 24, 2022 201,501 $ 109.48 $ 30,312\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $18.2 billion, $19.0 billion and $10.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 41 million, 53 million and 56 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Companys closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees tax obligations were $6.4 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 47\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nShare-based compensation expense $ 9,038 $ 7,906 $ 6,829\nIncome tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense\n$ (4,002) $ (4,056) $ (2,476)\nAs of September 24, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $16.7 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.\nNote 10 - Commitments and Contingencies\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (unconditional purchase obligations). The Companys unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022, are as follows (in millions):\n2023 $ 13,488\n2024 4,876\n2025 1,418\n2026 6,780\n2027 312\nThereafter 412\nTotal $ 27,286\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 48\nNote 11 - Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nAmericas:\nNet sales\n$ 169,658 $ 153,306 $ 124,556\nOperating income\n$ 62,683 $ 53,382 $ 37,722\nEurope:\nNet sales\n$ 95,118 $ 89,307 $ 68,640\nOperating income\n$ 35,233 $ 32,505 $ 22,170\nGreater China:\nNet sales\n$ 74,200 $ 68,366 $ 40,308\nOperating income\n$ 31,153 $ 28,504 $ 15,261\nJapan:\nNet sales\n$ 25,977 $ 28,482 $ 21,418\nOperating income\n$ 12,257 $ 12,798 $ 9,279\nRest of Asia Pacific:\nNet sales\n$ 29,375 $ 26,356 $ 19,593\nOperating income\n$ 11,569 $ 9,817 $ 6,808\nA reconciliation of the Companys segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nSegment operating income\n$ 152,895 $ 137,006 $ 91,240\nResearch and development expense\n(26,251) (21,914) (18,752)\nOther corporate expenses, net\n(7,207) (6,143) (6,200)\nTotal operating income\n$ 119,437 $ 108,949 $ 66,288\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Companys net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB), Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.s effective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing managements evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over managements assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, managements process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating managements assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as Apple Inc.s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 51\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets;\n(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Companys assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53 Item 9B.
