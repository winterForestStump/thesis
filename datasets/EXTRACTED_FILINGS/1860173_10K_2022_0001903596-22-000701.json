    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nBusiness Overview\nWe were incorporated on April 21, 2021 under the laws of the state of Wyoming. We are involved in the development of computer monitoring software known as Privacy and Value. We have retained independent computer software and application developers to develop our product to the specifications that we outline. Our president, Daniel Okelo, is responsible for developing the product concept that the independent developers subsequently design.\nPrivacy and Value Employee Monitoring Software\nWe are currently developing employee monitoring software known as Privacy and Value. Our goal is to develop a software product that balances employer concerns regarding employee efficiency and productivity with employee privacy.\nAs companies are increasingly attempting to meet the demands of employees that want work environment flexibility and are forced to avoid employee congregation in response to the current global Covid-19 pandemic, they are retaining staff that either work from home or they rely on outsourcing to retain employees and independent contractors in other countries. One of the primary concerns with having staff work in a separate location that removes them from the daily, direct oversight of management is that employee productivity will suffer. One of the responses to this concern is for businesses to use some form of worker surveillance in order to ensure that employees are utilizing their work time efficiently. However, businesses may face pushback from their staff due to concerns that their personal privacy is compromised when they are subject to constant monitoring during work hours. They may resist practices such as webcam surveillance or persistent computer screen observation.\nTo address employer concerns regarding staff efficiency and employee concerns regarding privacy, we intend to develop the Privacy and Value software that has features to monitor worker computer productivity while providing employees with reasonable privacy during their work days. The intended features of the software are as follows:\n\u25cf the software will monitor the employees computer desktops while they are actually working on the system. Surveillance will commence when an employee logs on to his or her computer through our software and will continue until the employee logs out of the system. After an employee signs out of the software, recording and monitoring will cease and the employee can access his or her computer contents and the Internet for personal purposes;\n\u25cf when the employee is logged in, the software will allow management to maintain real-time access to employee activity and to view each employees desktop screen content and the keystrokes that the employee is typing. All of this information will also be recorded and stored for future management use with all information time stamped. The file name for each days recording will be the employees first name, last name, and the year, month, and day, which will allow a manager to identify the appropriate recording without difficulty; and\n\u25cf based on employee actions, the software will calculate the amount of time that the employee was logged into the system based on a searchable time period (e.g., a shift, a week, or a month). It will also indicate the length of various time periods during which the employee did not make any keystrokes on his or her computer and allow the manager to quickly access the recording of employees desktop at the times when keystrokes commenced and stopped. The software will also provide details of the length of each break that the employee takes during the work period analyzed. It will also have tools that the manager can use, in tabular and graphic form, to compare the efficiency of employees in terms of keystrokes and time logged in to their computer.\nJoint Venture Development of Software\nOur parent company, Limitless Projects Inc., has entered into an Asset Purchase and Joint Venture agreement, as amended, whereby Cyber Apps World, Inc. (Cyber Apps), a reporting company, has agreed to purchase a 50% interest in the Privacy and Value software for the following payments:\n1. $10,000 upon execution of the agreement, which has been paid; and\n2. an amount equal to the estimation of the value of the 50% interest in Privacy and Value based upon an independent business valuation, less the $10,000 payment, which amount shall be no less than $50,000 and no more than $250,000 and was due by April 30, 2023.\nLimitless Projects Inc. obtained an independent valuation of the Privacy and Value software in its present form of development that estimated its value at approximately $2,200,000. Accordingly, the amount that was due from Cyber Apps to Limitless Projects Inc. under the Asset Purchase and Joint Agreement is $250,000.\nIf Limitless Projects Inc. completes the sale of the 50% interest in the Privacy and Value software to Cyber Apps, the parties will form a single purpose joint for the purpose of completing, testing, marketing, and selling the Privacy and Value software. The joint venture will be managed by a management committee with each party appointing one member to the committee and those two members jointly appointing an independent third member of the committee.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nBecause we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.\nWe will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:\n1. on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;\n2. on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;\n3. on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n4. the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a \u2018large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.\nA large accelerated filer is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:\n1. it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuers most recently completed second fiscal quarter;\n2. It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and\n3. It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act.\nAs an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:\n1. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;\n2. Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;\n3. Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;\n4. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies To disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and\n5. The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuers size.\nPursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected under this section of the JOBS Act to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions relating to complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.\nCompetition\nThe software development business, and in particular, the employee monitoring business, is extremely competitive. The employee monitoring sector includes large, established competitors such as ActivTrak, which raised $70 million in 2020 in order to expand its operations, and Time Doctor, which has over 83,000 customers, that have the software developers and financial resources necessary to modify design features and market their products in response to competitive threats. The market also includes smaller niche market participants that are specifically tailored to businesses of specific sizes, as well as businesses in specific industries or geographical locations.\nIn order to compete with well-established products like Teramind, ActivTrack, Veriato Cerebral, Hubstaff, and Time Doctor, we are focusing our product design and marketing not only on our software efficiency and ease of use for employers, but also the protection of employee privacy particularly in the work-from-home environment. However, despite our attempts to differentiate our product, we may be unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete with other companies in the sector will depend on our success in retaining skilled independent contractors to complete the development of our software and in raising sufficient funding in order to market and sell our software.\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nWe will be subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as consumer protection and privacy, data usage, data integrity, cybersecurity, worker confidentiality, and intellectual property. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.\nPrivacy, Data Storage, and Data Usage\nIn 2018, the European Union adopted measures to improve cybersecurity and data privacy practices by passing the General Data Protection Regulation to hold organizations liable for poor practices. The Regulation requires organizations to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services. Any company that fails to comply with the Regulation may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Similar laws are now in effect in countries such as Australia, Japan, Brazil, and South Korea, among others. While the United States has not adopted federal data security laws, it is likely that it will in the future. Although it is the companies that purchase our software, and in some instances, their customers who will be responsible for compliance with these laws and regulations, such enactments will impact our software design since we will be expected to develop software that allows companies to meet regulatory requirements.\nLicensors of the Privacy and Value software can use our product to collect, use, and store personal or identifying information regarding their employees. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from individuals. While there is no comprehensive federal law that governs data privacy in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over commercial entities to prevent deceptive trade practices. The FTC has the authority to take action against companies that fail to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures, fail to follow a privacy policy that they have adopted, or transfer or sell personal information. When the FTC has held that companies have failed to protect user privacy, they have often imposed substantial fines. For example, in 2019, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion for deceiving website users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal information.\nIn June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, which became effective in 2020. These duties include informing data subjects when and how data is collected and giving them the ability to access, correct, and delete such information. The CCPA creates a private right of action that could lead to consumer class actions and other litigation with statutory damages of up to $750 per violation. The California Attorney General will also maintain authority to enforce the CCPA and will be permitted to seek civil penalties for intentional violations of the CCPA of up to $7,500 per violation.\nNew York has adopted similar legislation, known as the SHIELD Act, which requires any person or business owning or licensing computerized data that includes the private information of a resident of New York to implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of the private information. Violators may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $5,000 dollars per violation.\nSurveillance\nOur Privacy and Value software will allow employers to monitor the work that employees conduct on their computers. The United States Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) allows business owners to monitor all employee verbal and written communication as long as the company can present a legitimate business reason for doing so. This ability for companies to monitor their workers extends to employee use of company devices, such as a computer. However, it is unclear how these provisions may apply to situations in which an employee works from home or uses his or her own personal computer for a combination of work and non-work tasks. Customers that use our software must ensure that they comply the ECPA provisions and also be aware of specific state constitutional laws in California, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina that guarantee resident rights to privacy and may require notice of monitoring to employees. While it would be our customers rather than us that must ensure compliance with surveillance laws, our business may be adversely impacted if potential customers are reluctant to purchase Privacy and Value software due to these legal concerns. Individuals who violate ECPA provisions face up to five years in prison and fines up to $250,000. Victims are also entitled to bring civil suits and recover actual damages, in addition to punitive damages and attorneys fees, for violations.\nIntellectual Property Laws\nWhile we have filed for trademark protection of the Privacy and Value name and logo, we have not filed for any other intellectual property protection of the Privacy and Value software. Without assessing whether we hold copyrights to the programming code that is included in the products we are developing or whether we may be violating intellectual property that others hold, we bear the risk that someone could either copy the software that we have developed or that we may be liable to a third-party for violating their intellectual property rights. While copyright protection of software is effective upon creation of the works, lack of copyright registration makes it more difficult for us to prove our ownership of the software we develop. If we are held to have infringed on the copyrighted work of others, we may have to pay damages to the copyright holder that may represent the gains that we realized from infringing the patent or possibly a much greater amount. The copyright holder is typically granted a permanent injunction that would prevent an infringing company from continuing to sell or license its software products.\nEmployees\nWe have no employees as of the date of this report. We have retained independent contractors to complete the development of our Privacy and Value software.\nResearch and Development Expenditures\nWe have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.\nSubsidiaries\nWe do not have any subsidiaries.\nPatents and Trademarks\nWe do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. We have recently submitted a trademark application for the Privacy and Value name and logo.\nDescription of Property\nWe do not own any interest in real property. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nNot applicable. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nWe do not own any interest in real property. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNone Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNone.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur shares of common stock do not trade on any recognized stock exchange or quotation system. We intend to retain a market maker that will file an application on our behalf to commence trading on OTC Markets. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain a market maker or that FINRA will approve the application and that a trading market will develop for our shares.\nAs of October 27, 2022, there were 38 owners of record of our common stock.\nHolders of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore and, in the event of liquidation, to share pro rata in any distribution of our assets after payment of liabilities. The Board of Directors is not obligated to declare a dividend. We have not paid any dividends and we do not have any current plans to pay any dividends.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nNone. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\nIntroduction\nWe were incorporated on April 21, 2021 under the laws of the State of Wyoming.\nResults of Operations for Fiscal 2022\nFrom August 1, 2021 to our fiscal year end of July 31, 2022, we earned $1,328 in revenue related to our sale of the Privacy and Value employee monitoring software. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, we incurred net loss of $207,003 due to $208,331 in general and administrative fees we incurred.\nWe have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to complete our proposed business plan. For these reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of July 31, 2022, our current assets were $10,096, consisting of $96 in cash and $10,000 in prepayments and deposits and our total liabilities were $357,575, which consisted entirely of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other methods, the sale of equity or debt securities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, cash flows from operating activities was $130,210 consisting of our net loss for 207,003 at period end, adjusted for accounts payable of $337,213 that did not impact our cash position.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, our cash flows used in investing activities were $160,000 which consisted of the purchase costs of fixed assets and software related to the development and sale of the Privacy and Value computer monitoring software.\nCash Flows from Investment Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, We have financed our operations from the issuance of our shares of common stock. Net cash flows generated from financing activities were $22,300 in the year ended July 31, 2022.\nWe have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these reasons, there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern\nSince our incorporation, we have financed our operations through proceeds from the sale of our common stock. We expect to finance operations through the sale of equity for the foreseeable future, as we do not receive significant revenue from our business operations. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in arranging financing on acceptable terms.\nOur ability to raise additional capital is affected by trends and uncertainties beyond our control. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we may not be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including investor sentiment. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to us.\nOur auditors are of the opinion that our continuation as a going concern is in doubt. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued financial support from our shareholders and other related parties.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, litigation and warranties. We base its estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment are accounted for by accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives:\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review property and equipment for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360-15-35 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of the long-lived asset and the related net book value.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period to period. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (PCAOB: 50909)\nJACK SHAMA, CPA, MA\nEast 32nd Street\nBrooklyn, NY 11234\n631-318-0351\nTo the shareholders and the board of directors of Privacy and Value Inc..\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\nOpinion on the financial statements.\nI have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Privacy and Value Inc. and the related statements of income, stockholders equity, cash flows, including the related notes and any related schedules for the years ended July 31, 2022, and the period (inception) April 21, 2021 - July 31, 2021. In my opinion the financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the company as of July 31, 2022, and July 31, 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing concern matters.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the company has incurred losses, and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for opinion.\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on my audit. I am a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. I conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. My audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.\nCritical audit matters.\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved my especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. I have determined that there are no critical audit matters to report.\nThe company is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of my audit, I am required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I express no such opinion.\n/s/ Jack Shama, CPA\nJack Shama, CPA\nOctober 19, 2022\nI have served as the companys auditor since May 2021.\nPRIVACY AND VALUE INC\nAUDITED BALANCE SHEET\nJuly 31, July 31,\n$ $\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash 7,587\nPrepayment & Deposit 10,000 10,000\nTotal current assets: 10,096 17,587\nFixed assets:\nOffice Equipment 5,428 5,428\nSoftware 163,000 3,000\nTotal fixed assets: 168,428 8,428\nTotal Assets: 178,524 26,015\nLIABILITIES & STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 357,575 20,363\nTotal current liabilities: 357,575 20,363\nTotal Liabilities: 357,575 20,363\nSTOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCommon stock: $0.0001 par value, 500,000,000 authorized, 201,115,000 issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2022, 200,000,000 issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2021, respectively. 20,112 20,000\nAdditional Paid in Capital 22,188 -\nAccumulated deficit (221,351 ) (14,348 )\nTotal stockholders equity: (179,051 ) 5,652\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders Equity: 178,524 26,015\n(The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements)\nPRIVACY AND VALUE INC\nAUDITED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nFor the year ended\nJuly 31, July 31,\n$ $\nIncome:\nGeneral Revenue 1,328\nTotal Income: 1,328\nExpenses:\nGeneral and Administrative 208,331 14,415\nNet Loss: (207,003 ) (14,348 )\nNet loss per share - basic and diluted - -\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 201,115,000 201,115,000\n(The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements)\nPRIVACY AND VALUE INC\nAUDITED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022\nCommon Stock Paid in Accumulated\nNumber Par Value Capital Deficit Total\n$ $ $ $\nOpening Balance as of April 21, 2021 (inception) - - - - -\nIssuance of common stock 200,000,000 20,000 - - 20,000\nNet Loss - - - (14,348 ) (14,348 )\nClosing Balance - July 31, 2021 200,000,000 20,000 - (14,348 ) 5,652\nOpening Balance - July 31, 2021 200,000,000 20,000 - (14,348 ) 5,652\nIssuance of common stock 1,115,000 22,188 - 22,300\nNet Loss - - - (207,003 ) (207,003 )\nClosing Balance - July 31, 2022 201,115,000 20,112 22,188 (221,351 ) (179,051 )\n(The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements)\nPRIVACY AND VALUE INC\nAUDITED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the year ended\nJuly 31,\n$ $\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet loss for the period (207,003 ) (14,348 )\nChange in operating assets and liabilities - -\nPrepayments & deposits - (10,000 )\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 337,212 20,363\nNet cash provided (used) in operating activities: 130,209 (3,985 )\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPurchase of fixed assets and software (160,000 ) (8,428 )\nNet cash used in investing activities: (160,000 ) (8,428 )\nNet cash used in investing activities:\nIssuance of common stock 20,000\nProceeds from paid in capital 22,188 -\nNet cash provided from financing activities: 22,300 20,000\nChange in cash (7,491 ) 7,587\nCash - beginning of period 7,587 -\nCash - end of period 7,587\nSupplemental cash flow disclosures - -\nCash paid For:\nInterest - -\nIncome tax - -\n(The accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements)\nPRIVACY AND VALUE INC\nNOTES TO AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJuly 31, 2022\n1. NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS\nPRIVACY AND VALUE INC (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Wyoming on April 21, 2021 (Inception). The Company is a development stage company that is currently developing employee monitoring software that balances employer concerns regarding employee efficiency and productivity with employee privacy.\n2. GOING CONCERN\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a net loss for the year-ended July 31, 2022, of $207,003, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $221,351 as of July 31, 2022. The Company anticipates further losses the development of its business which raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of no less than twelve months from the date of this report. To continue operations, the Company will need to generate income from operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and proceeds from its public offering. The Company has no written or verbal commitments from stockholders, director or officer to provide the Company with any form of cash advances, loans or other sources of liquidity to meet its working capital needs. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThese financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company has selected July 31 as its year-end. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and the results of operations have been reflected herein.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances at one financial institution that is insured by the FDIC. As of July 31, 2022, the Company had $96 in cash.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for all financial instruments and non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. This accounting standard establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. It does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nAS topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\nThese tiers include:\nLevel 1: Defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable;\nLevel 3: Defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company has adopted FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe Company adopted FASB ASC 220, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders equity that are excluded from net income, such as unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale, foreign currency translation gains and losses and minimum pension liability. Since Inception, the Companys other comprehensive income represents foreign currency translation adjustments.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification No. 606, Revenue Recognition (ASC-606), ASC-606 requires that five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and both parties will perform their respective obligations; (2) can identify each partys rights regarding goods or services being transferred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; (4) the contract has commercial substance; and (5) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (5) are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.\nBecause the Company assumes that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered, which gives rise to a deferred tax asset. The Company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation allowance.\nThe Company has adopted FASB guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which provides a consolidated financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under this guidance, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance also extends to de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nThe Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the period from August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022 there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nDue to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company adopts new pronouncements relating to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to the Company as they are issued, which may be in advance of their effective date.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Among other things, under the new guidance, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in-capital (APIC), but will instead record such items as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. Companies will apply this guidance prospectively. Another component of the new guidance allows companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards, whereby forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur. If elected, the change to recognize forfeitures when they occur needs to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The amendment is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, if any, on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which issued new guidance related to leases that outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms of greater than 12 months. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. The new guidance must be adopted using the modified retrospective approach and will be effective for the public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, if any, on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The guidance requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation, rather than the lower of cost or market in the previous guidance. This amendment applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO). This amendment is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. A reporting entity should apply the amendments prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, if any, on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard by an additional year; however, it provided companies the option to adopt one year earlier, commensurate with the original effective date. The amendment is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating this standard and has not yet selected a transition method or the effective date on which it plans to adopt the standard, nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its financial statements and related disclosures.\n4. CAPITAL STOCK\nThe total number of common shares authorized that may be issued by the Company is 500,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nDuring the period ended July 31, 2022, the Company issued 1,115,000 shares of common stock for total proceeds of $22,300.\nOn July 31, 2022, there were no issued and outstanding stock options or warrants.\n5. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company adopted the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in ASC 740-10-65-1. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-65-1, the Company recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of July 31, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $550 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts through 2041. For the period ended July 31, 2022, the Company has no income tax recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, as the Company has yet to earn taxable income. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of July 31, 2022. All tax years since Inception remains open for examination by taxing authorities.\n6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThere are no subsequent events. Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nAs supervised by our board of directors and our principal executive and principal financial officer, management has established a system of disclosure, controls and procedures and has evaluated the effectiveness of that system. The system and its evaluation are reported on in the below Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our principal executive and financial officer has concluded that our disclosure, controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rule 13a-15(e)) as of July 31, 2022, were not effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022. We carried out this assessment using the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control -Integrated Framework.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nOur system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nBased on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of July 31, 2022 and were subject to material weaknesses.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in the COSO:\n1. Failing to have an audit committee or other independent committee that is independent of management to assess internal control over financial reporting; and\n2. Failing to have a director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm, pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report. Management concluded in this assessment that as of July 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.\nThere have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of our 2022 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
