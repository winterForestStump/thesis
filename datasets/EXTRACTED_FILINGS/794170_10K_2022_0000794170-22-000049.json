    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nToll Brothers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Delaware in May 1986, began doing business through predecessor entities in 1967. When this report uses the words we, us, our, and the Company, they refer to Toll Brothers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31.\nGeneral\nWe design, build, market, sell, and arrange financing for an array of luxury residential single-family detached home, attached home, master-planned, and urban low-, mid-, and high-rise communities. This is done principally on land we develop and improve, as we continue to pursue our strategy of broadening our product lines, price points and geographic footprint. We cater to luxury first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult and second-home buyers in the United States, as well as urban and suburban renters under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living\u00ae and Toll Brothers Campus Living\u00ae. We also design, build, market, and sell high-density, high-rise urban luxury condominiums with third-party joint venture partners through Toll Brothers City Living\u00ae (City Living). At October 31, 2022, we were operating in 24 states and in the District of Columbia.\nIn the five years ended October 31, 2022, we delivered 45,369 homes from 904 communities, including 10,515 homes from 492 communities in fiscal 2022. At October 31, 2022, we had 981 communities in various stages of planning, development or operations containing approximately 76,000 home sites that we owned or controlled through options.\nBacklog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers. We had a backlog of $8.87 billion (8,098 homes) at October 31, 2022; we expect to deliver approximately 90% of these homes in fiscal 2023.\nWe operate our own architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, land development, insurance, smart home technology, and landscaping subsidiaries. In addition, in certain regions we operate our own lumber distribution, house component assembly and component manufacturing operations.\nWe are developing several land parcels for master-planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. The majority of these master-planned communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners, with one being developed 100% by us.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate urban and suburban for-rent apartment communities primarily through joint ventures. These projects are located in various metropolitan areas throughout the country and are generally being operated or developed (or we expect will be developed) with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living\u00ae and Toll Brothers Campus Living\u00ae. At October 31, 2022, we or joint ventures in which we have an interest, controlled 73 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 25,000 planned units.\nSee Investments in Unconsolidated Entities below for more information relating to our joint ventures.\nOur Communities and Homes\nOur home building communities are generally located in affluent suburban areas near major transit hubs and highways that provide access to employment and urban centers. They are generally located on land we have either acquired and developed or acquired fully approved and, in some cases, improved.\nAt October 31, 2022, we were operating in the following major suburban and urban residential markets:\nBoston, Massachusetts metropolitan area\nFairfield, Hartford, and New Haven Counties, Connecticut\nWestchester and Dutchess Counties, New York\nNew York metropolitan area\nCentral and northern New Jersey\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania metropolitan area\nLehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania\nVirginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.\nDelaware\nRaleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina metropolitan areas\nNashville, Tennessee\nCharleston, Greenville, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina\nAtlanta, Georgia metropolitan area\nSoutheast and southwest coasts and the Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa areas of Florida\nDetroit, Michigan metropolitan area\nChicago, Illinois metropolitan area\nDallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio, Texas metropolitan areas\nDenver, Colorado metropolitan area, Fort Collins and Colorado Springs, Colorado\nPhoenix, Arizona metropolitan area\nLas Vegas and Reno, Nevada metropolitan areas\nBoise and Coeur dAlene, Idaho metropolitan areas\nSalt Lake City, Utah metropolitan area and St. George/Southern Utah\nSan Diego and Palm Springs, California\nLos Angeles, California metropolitan area and Orange County\nSan Francisco Bay, Sacramento, and San Jose areas of northern California\nSeattle and Spokane, Washington metropolitan areas, and\nPortland, Oregon metropolitan area.\nWe develop individual stand-alone single-product communities as well as multi-product, master-planned communities. Our master-planned communities enable us to offer multiple home types and sizes to a broad range of move-up, first-time, empty-nester, active-adult, and second-home buyers. We seek to realize efficiencies from shared common costs, such as land development and infrastructure, over the several communities within the master-planned community.\nEach of our detached home communities offers several home plans with the opportunity for home buyers to select various structural options and exterior styles. We design each community to fit existing land characteristics. We strive to achieve diversity among architectural styles within a community by offering a variety of house models and several exterior design options for each model, preserving existing trees, foliage and other natural features whenever feasible, and curving street layouts to allow relatively few homes to be seen from any vantage point. Our communities have attractive entrances with distinctive signage and landscaping. We believe that our added attention to detail gives each community a diversified neighborhood appearance that enhances home values.\nOur attached home communities generally offer one- to four-story homes, provide for select exterior options, and often include commonly owned recreational facilities, such as clubhouses, playing fields, swimming pools, and tennis courts.\nWe are continuously developing new designs to replace or augment existing ones to ensure that our homes reflect current consumer tastes. Increasingly, we are modifying designs and the number of options we provide in order to continue to offer our customers a curated experience while gaining efficiencies in the home building process, particularly in respect to our affordable luxury product. We use our own architectural staff and also engage unaffiliated architectural firms to develop new designs.\nA wide selection of structural and finishing options are available to our home buyers for additional charges. The number and complexity of options available typically increase with the size and base sales price of our homes. Major options include home offices, fitness rooms, multi-generational living suites, finished basements, and spacious indoor/outdoor living areas. We also offer numerous interior fit-out options such as flooring, wall tile, plumbing, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, lighting, and home-automation and security technologies.\nWe market our high-quality homes to both upscale luxury and affordable luxury home buyers. Our luxury homes are marketed primarily to buyers who generally have previously owned a home and who are seeking to buy a larger or more desirable home\n- the so-called move-up market. Our affordable luxury homes are marketed primarily to more affluent first-time buyers. We believe our reputation as a builder of luxury homes in these markets enhances our competitive position with respect to the sale of our smaller, more moderately priced homes.\nWe continue to pursue growth initiatives by expanding our geographic footprint and by broadening our product lines and price points to appeal to buyers across the demographic spectrum. In addition to our traditional move-up home buyer, we are focusing on the empty-nester market, the millennial generation, and the affordable luxury buyer.\nWe market to the empty-nester market, which we believe has strong growth potential. We have developed a number of home designs with features such as single-story living and first-floor primary bedroom suites, as well as communities with recreational amenities, such as golf courses, marinas, pool complexes, country clubs, fitness and recreation centers that we believe appeal to this category of home buyer. We have integrated certain of these designs and features in some of our other home types and communities. As of October 31, 2022, we were selling from 51 age-restricted active-adult communities, in which at least one home occupant must be at least 55 years of age.\nWith the millennial generation in its prime family formation years, we also continue to focus on this group with our core suburban homes, affordable luxury offerings, urban condominiums and luxury rental apartment products.\nThrough our City Living brand, with third-party joint venture partners, we currently are developing a number of high-density, high-rise urban luxury communities to serve affluent move-up families, empty-nesters, and young professionals who are seeking to live in or close to major cities.\nThese City Living communities are high-rise condominiums and take an extended period of time to construct. We generally start selling homes in these communities after construction has commenced. By the time construction has been completed, we typically have a significant number of homes under contract with buyers in backlog. Once construction has been completed, the homes in backlog in these communities are generally delivered quickly. Because of the larger upfront costs and longer development time periods associated with high-rise projects, we are developing, and expect to continue to, develop all future City Living communities through joint ventures with third parties.\nWe believe that the demographics supporting the luxury first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, affordable luxury and second-home upscale markets will provide us with an opportunity for growth in the future. We continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future.\nAt October 31, 2022, we were selling homes from 348 communities, compared to 340 communities at October 31, 2021, and 317 communities at October 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes certain information with respect to our operating communities at October 31, 2022:\nTotal number of operating communities Number of selling communities Homes approved Homes closed Homes under contract but not closed (Backlog) Home sites available\nNorth 81 53 10,155 6,103 1,122 2,930\nMid-Atlantic 53 40 4,184 1,958 842 1,384\nSouth 133 99 14,438 5,072 2,523 6,843\nMountain 133 113 17,774 6,225 2,524 9,025\nPacific 59 43 5,683 1,910 1,087 2,686\nTotal 459 348 52,234 21,268 8,098 22,868\nAt October 31, 2022, significant site improvements had not yet commenced on approximately 14,000 of the 22,868 available home sites. Of the 22,868 available home sites, approximately 6,500 were not yet owned by us but were controlled through options.\nOf our 459 operating communities at October 31, 2022, a total of 348 communities were offering homes for sale; with the remaining consisting primarily of sold out communities where not all homes had been completed and delivered. Of the 348 communities in which homes were being offered for sale at October 31, 2022, a total of 276 were detached home communities and 72 were attached home communities.\nAt October 31, 2022, excluding 373 model homes, we had 1,929 homes under construction or completed but not under contract in our communities, of which 998 were affordable luxury homes, 558 were luxury homes, and 373 were active-adult homes.\nAs a result of the breath of our products and geographic footprint, we have a wide range of base sales prices for our homes. The percentage of the 10,515 homes delivered in fiscal 2022 within the various ranges of base sales price was as follows:\nRange of Base Sales Price Percentage of Homes Delivered in Fiscal 2022\nLess than $500,000 10%\n$500,000 to $750,000 37%\n$750,000 to $1,000,000 24%\n$1,000,000 to 2,000,000 25%\nMore than $2,000,000 4%\nOf the homes delivered in fiscal 2022, approximately 21% of our home buyers paid the full purchase price in cash; the remaining home buyers borrowed approximately 71% of the sales price of the home.\nThe table below provides the average value of all structural and finishing options purchased by our home buyers, as well as lot premiums, and the value of these options and premiums as a percent of the base sales price of the homes purchased in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nOption value (in thousands) Percent of base sales price Option value (in thousands) Percent of base sales price Option value (in thousands) Percent of base sales price\nOverall $ 190 25.3 % $ 168 23.9 % $ 173 25.5 %\nDetached $ 215 28.9 % $ 193 28.4 % $ 198 28.8 %\nAttached $ 117 15.4 % $ 105 15.3 % $ 98 15.7 %\nIn general, the ability to purchase a premium lot or customize a home with structural options and interior finishes varies widely across our product lines, which may result in significant variation in the option value as a percentage of base sales price. For example, our attached homes do not offer the opportunity for buyers to add significant structural options to their homes and thus they have a smaller option value as a percentage of base sales price.\nFor more information regarding revenues, net contracts signed, income (loss) before income taxes, and assets by segment, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segments in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our strategy to continue expanding our geographic footprint and product offerings, in fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a privately-held home builder with operations in San Antonio, Texas for approximately $48.1 million in cash. The assets acquired, which consisted of 16 communities, were primarily inventory, including approximately 450 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements.\nIn fiscal 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a privately-held home builder serving the Las Vegas, Nevada market, for approximately $38.8 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory for future communities, including approximately 550 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements.\nIn fiscal 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of an urban infill builder with operations in Atlanta, Georgia and Nashville, Tennessee. We also acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a builder with operations is Colorado Springs, Colorado. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $79.2 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory, including approximately 1,100 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase options.\nLand Policy\nBefore entering into an agreement to purchase a land parcel, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses that assist us in evaluating the acquisition. These analyses may include soil tests, environmental studies, an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research to evaluate which of our product offerings are appropriate for the market. In addition to purchasing land parcels outright, we are increasingly attempting to enter into option agreements and other arrangements to defer the acquisition of land until we are closer in time to delivering the completed home to our\ncustomer. We have also entered into several joint ventures with other builders, financial partners, or developers to develop land for the use of the joint venture participants or for sale to third parties. These structures are generally more capital efficient than outright land purchases that occur earlier in the entitlement and development process.\nOur business is subject to many risks, including risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals on a property and completing the land improvements on it. In order to reduce the financial risk associated with land acquisitions and holdings and to more efficiently manage our capital, where practicable, we enter into option agreements (also referred to herein as land purchase contracts, purchase agreements, or options) to purchase land, on a non-recourse basis, thereby limiting our financial exposure to amounts expended in obtaining any necessary governmental approvals, the costs incurred in the planning and design of the community, and, in some cases, some or all of the cost of the option (also referred to as deposits). Option agreements enable us to obtain necessary governmental approvals before we acquire title to the land, and allow us to acquire lots over a specified period of time at contracted prices. The use of these agreements may increase our overall cost basis in the land that we eventually acquire, but reduces our risk by allowing us to obtain the necessary development approvals before acquiring the land or allowing us to forego or delay the acquisition to a later date. In prior periods, during the time it took to obtain approvals, the value of the purchase agreements and land generally increased; however, in any given time period, this may not happen. We have the ability to extend some of these purchase agreements for varying periods of time, which in some cases would require an additional payment. Our purchase agreements are typically subject to numerous conditions, including, but not limited to, the ability to obtain necessary governmental approvals for the proposed community. In certain instances, our deposit under an agreement may be returned to us if all approvals are not obtained, although predevelopment costs usually will not be recoverable. We generally have the right to cancel any of our agreements to purchase land by forfeiture of some or all of the deposits we have made pursuant to the agreement.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, we acquired control of approximately 5,700 and 27,700 home sites, respectively, net of options terminated and lots sold. During fiscal year 2022, we forfeited control of over 9,000 lots subject to land purchase agreements primarily because the planned community no longer met our development criteria. At October 31, 2022, we controlled approximately 76,000 home sites, as compared to approximately 80,900 home sites at October 31, 2021. At October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, our percentage of optioned versus owned lots was 50% and 50%, respectively.\nWe, either alone or in joint venture, are developing several parcels of land for master-planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots, with the remaining lots being sold to other builders. At October 31, 2022, one of these master-planned communities was wholly owned, while the remaining communities were developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners. At October 31, 2022, our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 24,300 home sites. At October 31, 2022, we had agreed to acquire 409 home sites and expect to purchase approximately 6,700 additional home sites from several of our Land Development Joint Ventures over a number of years.\nOur ability and willingness to continue development activities over the long term will depend on, among other things, a suitable economic environment and our continued ability to locate and enter into options or agreements to purchase land, obtain governmental approvals for suitable parcels of land, and consummate the acquisition and complete the development of such land on acceptable terms.\nThe following is a summary of home sites for future communities (as distinguished from operating communities) that we either owned or controlled through options or purchase agreements at October 31, 2022:\nNumber of communities Number of home sites\nNorth 67 4,953\nMid-Atlantic 141 12,359\nSouth 154 12,657\nMountain 99 9,754\nPacific 61 5,360\nTotal 522 45,083\nOf the 45,083 planned home sites at October 31, 2022, we owned 13,213 and controlled 31,870 through options and purchase agreements.\nAt October 31, 2022, the aggregate purchase price of land parcels subject to option and purchase agreements in both operating and future communities was approximately $4.32 billion (including $42.1 million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested). Of the $4.32 billion of land purchase contracts, we paid or deposited $463.5 million. If we acquire all of these land parcels, we will be required to pay an additional $3.86 billion. The purchases of these land parcels are expected to occur over the next several years. We have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from this aggregate\npurchase price because we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts. These option contracts have either been written off or written down to the estimated amount that we expect to recover when the contracts are terminated.\nWe have a substantial amount of land currently under control for which approvals have been obtained or are being sought. We devote significant resources to locating suitable land for future development and obtaining the required approvals on land under our control. There can be no assurance that the necessary development approvals will be secured for the land currently under our control or for land that we may acquire control of in the future or that, upon obtaining such development approvals, we will elect to complete the purchases of land under option or complete the development of land that we own. We generally have been successful in obtaining governmental approvals in the past. We believe that we have an adequate supply of land in our existing communities and proposed communities (assuming that all properties are developed) to maintain our operations at current levels for several years.\nCommunity Development\nWe expend considerable effort in developing a plan for each community, which includes determining the size, style, and price range of the homes; the layout of the streets and individual home sites; and the overall community design. After the necessary governmental subdivision and other approvals have been obtained, which may take several years, we improve the land by clearing and grading it; installing roads, underground utilities, recreational amenities, and distinctive entrance features; and staking out individual home sites.\nWe act as a general contractor for substantially all of our communities. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development work, generally under fixed-price contracts. We generally have multiple sources for the materials we purchase. In recent years, as a result of strong demand for homes following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and the constrained availability of certain building products, housing components and construction labor, and municipality-related delays, the production cycle in many of our markets became elongated. There can be no assurance that these challenges will recede or that cycle times will normalize in the near term. See Risk Factors - General Risk Factors in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are subject to demand fluctuations in the housing industry. Any reduction in demand would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDemand for our homes and rental apartments is subject to fluctuations, often due to factors outside of our control, such as employment levels, consumer confidence and spending, housing demand, availability of financing for homebuyers, interest rates, availability and prices of new homes compared to existing inventory, and demographic trends. In a housing market downturn, our sales and results of operations will be adversely affected; we may have significant inventory impairments and other write-offs; our gross margins may decline significantly from historical levels; and we may incur substantial losses from operations. At any particular time, we cannot accurately predict whether housing market conditions will improve, deteriorate or continue as they exist at that time.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live could reduce the demand for homes and, as a result, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in mortgage interest rates, employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, perceptions regarding the strength of the housing market, and population growth, or an oversupply of homes for sale may reduce demand or depress prices for our homes and cause home buyers to cancel their agreements to purchase our homes. This, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant inflation, higher interest rates or deflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor, and interest rates. All of these factors can have a negative impact on housing affordability. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the sales prices of our homes at or above the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. In addition, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results. For example, the current and continued macro-economic conditions of high inflation and rising interest rates, especially the steep increases in mortgage rates during 2022, is one of the primary drivers behind the overall decrease in demand for new homes since our second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nConversely, deflation could cause an overall decrease in spending and borrowing capacity, which could lead to deterioration in economic conditions and employment levels. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes. These, or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation, could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.\nThe risks associated with our land, lot and rental inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land. If housing demand declines, we may not be able to build, sell or rent homes profitably in some of our communities, we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own, and we may forfeit deposits on land that we put under control through option arrangements. We acquire land or make payments to control land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within existing markets. If housing demand in a given market declines below the levels that we expected when we acquired or gained control of land, we may have to sell or rent homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots. Due to the decline in our business during the 2006-2011 downturn in the housing industry, we recognized significant inventory impairments. We cannot assure you that significant inventory impairments will not occur again in the future.\nIf land is not available at reasonable prices, our sales and results of operations could decrease.\nIn the long term, our operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for the development of our residential communities. At October 31, 2022, we had approximately 76,000 home sites that we owned or controlled through options. In the future, changes in the availability of land, competition for available land, availability of financing to acquire land, zoning regulations that limit housing density, and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential communities at acceptable prices. If the supply of land appropriate for the development of our residential communities becomes more limited because of these factors or for any other reason, the cost of land could increase and/or the number of homes that we are able to sell and build could be reduced.\nOur ability to execute on our business strategies is uncertain, and we may be unable to achieve our goals.\nWe cannot guarantee that (i) our strategies, which include expanding our geographic footprint, product lines and price points, and becoming a more capital and operationally efficient home builder, and any related initiatives or actions (including home builder acquisitions), will be successful or that they will generate growth, earnings or returns at any particular level or within any particular time frame; (ii) in the future we will achieve positive operational or financial results or results in any particular metric or measure equal to or better than those attained in the past; or (iii) we will perform in any period as well as other home builders. We also cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, in the future and, due to unexpectedly favorable or unfavorable market conditions or other factors, we may determine that we need to adjust, refine or abandon all or portions of our strategies, and any related initiatives or actions, though we cannot guarantee that any such adjustments will be successful. The failure of any one or more of our present strategies, or any related initiatives or actions, or the failure of any adjustments that we may pursue or implement, would likely have an adverse\neffect on our ability to increase the value and profitability of our business; on our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course; on our overall liquidity; and on our consolidated financial statements, and the effect, in each case, could be material.\nNegative publicity could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nOur business is dependent upon the appeal of the Toll Brothers brand, and its association with quality and luxury is integral to our success. Our strategy includes growing our business by expanding our luxury brand to new price points, product lines and geographies, including expansion of our affordable luxury products. If we are unable to maintain the position of the Toll Brothers brand, our business may be adversely affected by diminishing the distinctive appeal of the brand and tarnishing its image. This could result in lower sales and earnings.\nIn addition, unfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry, company, brand, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy. Furthermore, the speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites and other digital platforms. Our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe can also be affected by poor relations with the residents of communities we develop because efforts made by us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities, or in connection with the transition of a homeowners association, could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could decide or be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes, which could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues and income from operations is generated from California.\nA significant portion of our revenues and income from operations are concentrated in California. Factors beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and/or income from operations generated in California. These factors include, but are not limited to: changes in the regulatory and fiscal environment; prolonged economic downturns; high levels of foreclosures; lack of affordability; a decline in foreign buyer demand; severe weather including drought; the risk of local governments imposing building moratoriums and of state or local governments imposing regulations that increase building costs; natural disasters such as earthquakes and wild fires; environmental incidents; and declining population and/or growth rates and the related reduction in housing demand in this region. If home sale activity or sales prices decline in California, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and our inventory and lots owned or controlled in the state may be at risk of impairment. As a result, our consolidated financial results may be adversely affected.\nIn the construction of a mid-rise, high-rise or multifamily building, whether a for-sale or a for-rent property, we incur significant costs before we can begin construction, sell and deliver the units to our customers, or commence the collection of rent and recover our costs. We may be subject to delays in construction that could lead to higher costs that could adversely affect our operating results. Changing market conditions during the construction period could negatively impact sales prices and rents, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nBefore a mid-rise, high-rise or multifamily building generates any revenues, we make significant expenditures to acquire land; to obtain permits, development approvals, and entitlements; and to construct the building. It generally takes several years for us to acquire the land and construct, market, and deliver units or lease units in a high-rise building. Completion times vary on a building-by-building basis depending on the complexity of the project, its stage of development when acquired, our relationship with any joint venture partners that may be involved in a project, and the regulatory and community issues involved. As a result of these potential delays in the completion of a building, we face the risk that demand for housing may decline during this period and we may be forced to sell or lease units at a loss or for prices that generate lower profit margins than we initially anticipated. Furthermore, if construction is delayed, we may face increased costs as a result of inflation or other causes and/or asset carrying costs (including interest on funds used to acquire the land and construct the building). These costs can be significant and can adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if values of the building or units decline, we may also be required to recognize material write-downs of the book value of the building in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIncreases in cancellations of existing agreements of sale could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur backlog reflects agreements of sale with our home buyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We have received a deposit from our home buyer for each home reflected in our backlog, and generally we have the right to retain the deposit if the home buyer does not complete the purchase. In some cases, however, a home buyer may cancel the agreement of sale and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit for reasons such as state and local law requirements, the home buyers\ninability to obtain mortgage financing, the home buyers inability to sell their current home, or our inability to complete and deliver the home within the specified time. Home buyers may also choose to cancel their home agreement and forfeit their deposit. At October 31, 2022, we had 8,098 homes with a sales value of $8.87 billion in backlog. If economic conditions decline, if mortgage financing becomes less available, or if our homes become less attractive due to market price declines or due to other conditions at or in the vicinity of our communities, we could experience an increase in home buyers canceling their agreements of sale with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe home building industry is highly competitive, and, if other home builders are more successful or offer better value to our customers, our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment in which we face competition from a number of other home builders in each market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional home building companies and with smaller local home builders for land, financing, building components, and skilled management and labor resources. We also compete with the resale home market, also referred to as the previously owned or existing home market. An oversupply of homes available for sale or the heavy discounting of home prices by some of our competitors could adversely affect demand for our homes and the results of our operations. An increase in competitive conditions can have any of the following impacts on us: delivery of fewer homes; sale of fewer homes; higher cancellations by our home buyers; an increase in selling incentives and/or reduction of prices; and realization of lower gross margins due to lower sales prices or an inability to increase sales prices to offset increased costs of the homes delivered. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to that of our competitors.\nWe rely on subcontractors to develop our land and construct our homes and on building supply companies to supply components for the construction of our homes. The failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes and adopt appropriate jobsite safety practices or defects in the components we obtain from building supply companies could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe engage subcontractors to develop our land and construct our homes, including by purchasing components used in the construction of our homes from building supply companies. Despite our quality control and jobsite safety efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper development, construction or safety practices or that the components purchased from building supply companies are not performing as specified. The occurrence of such events could require us to repair facilities and homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law, or to respond to claims of improper oversight of construction sites. The cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, suppliers and insurers. For example, we have incurred or expect to incur significant costs to repair homes built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 7 - Accrued Expenses in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding warranty charges.\nWe participate in certain joint ventures where we may be adversely impacted by the failure of the joint venture or its participants to fulfill their obligations.\nWe have investments in and commitments to certain joint ventures with unrelated parties. These joint ventures generally borrow money to help finance their activities. In certain circumstances, the joint venture participants, including us, are required to provide guarantees of certain obligations relating to the joint ventures. In most of these joint ventures, we do not have a controlling interest and, as a result, are not able to require these joint ventures or their participants to honor their obligations or renegotiate them on acceptable terms. If the joint ventures or their participants do not honor their obligations, we may be required to expend additional resources or suffer losses, which could be significant.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our communities, increase our expenses, or limit our home building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our development activities, and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. We incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs or, in some cases, cause us to determine that the property is not feasible for development.\nVarious local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales, accessibility, safety, anti-discrimination, and similar matters apply to and/or affect the housing industry. Governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities, and other dealings with home buyers, including anti-discrimination laws such as the Fair Housing Act and data privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. The industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations that limit the availability or use of land. Municipalities may also restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. In addition, we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of\nchanges in local circumstances or applicable law. If municipalities in which we operate take actions like these, it could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays, increasing our costs, or limiting our ability to operate in those municipalities. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\nOur mortgage subsidiary, TBMC, is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations, and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules, and regulations can increase our home buyers cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, and restrict our home buyers access to some types of loans.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a home builder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the home building industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced, insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, we may experience losses that could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability under our insurance policies and estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The projection of losses related to these liabilities requires actuarial assumptions that are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, insurance industry practices, and legal or regulatory actions and/or interpretations, among other factors. Key assumptions used in these estimates include claim frequencies, severities, and settlement patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. In addition, changes in the frequency and severity of reported claims and the estimates to settle claims can impact the trends and assumptions used in the actuarial analysis, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Due to the degree of judgment required and the potential for variability in these underlying assumptions, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOver the past several years, we have had a significant number of water intrusion claims related to homes we built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 7 - Accrued Expenses in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nOur condominium and rental multi-unit buildings are subject to fluctuations in delivery volume due to their extended construction time, levels of pre-sales and lease-up, and quick delivery of units once buildings are complete.\nOur quarterly operating results will fluctuate depending on the timing of completion of construction of our multi-unit condominium buildings, levels of pre-sales, and the relatively short delivery time of the pre-sold units once the building is completed. These sales can result in significant gains or losses that we recognize on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as income from unconsolidated entities. The timing of these gains or losses cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, can cause our net income to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop, operate and, in certain situations, sell for-rent apartments, which we accomplish mainly through joint ventures. Often, the joint venture through which we develop and lease-up a rental property sells the property to a third party or to the joint venture partner upon stabilization. These sales can result in significant gains or losses that we recognize on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as income from unconsolidated entities. The timing of these gains or losses cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, can cause our net income to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of our business.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate with the seasons; normally, a significant portion of our agreements of sale are entered into with customers in the winter and spring months. Construction of one of our homes typically proceeds after signing the agreement of sale with our customer and typically require 9 to 12 months to complete, although recently construction times have extended beyond 12 months in many communities due to a variety of reasons, including high demand, labor shortages, supply chain disruption and municipal related delays. In addition, weather-related events may occur from time to time, delaying starts or closings or increasing costs and reducing profitability. In addition, delays in opening new communities or new sections\nof existing communities could have an adverse impact on home sales and revenues. Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year. Because of these factors, our quarterly operating results may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters than in others.\nIncreases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs, and adverse changes in tax laws or their interpretation could reduce demand for our homes and negatively affect our operating results.\nIncreases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, and/or provide low- and moderate-income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential home buyers, who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide, as a result, not to purchase one of our homes.\nChanges in tax laws could reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives for homeowners and could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing, which in turn could reduce our sales and hurt our results of operations. Further, while we believe that our recorded tax balances are adequate, it is not possible to predict the effects of possible changes in the tax laws or changes in their interpretation and whether they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. We have filed our tax returns in prior years based upon certain filing positions we believe are appropriate. If the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authorities disagree with these filing positions, we may owe additional taxes, which could be material.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may cause us to incur additional operating expenses, subject us to longer construction cycle times, or result in material fines or harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of storm water runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we own or develop. In addition, state and local jurisdictions have in recent years enacted regulations that require new homes to be more energy efficient than existing homes, or have mandated energy efficient features, such as solar panels, be included in new construction. The environmental regulations applicable to each community in which we operate vary greatly depending on the location of the community site, the site's environmental conditions and the present and former use of the site. Environmental regulations may cause delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation or other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and home building activity. In addition, noncompliance with these regulations could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocations or other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments, whether or not we were responsible for such conditions, may result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage or other losses.\nFrom time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other federal or state agencies review home builders' compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs or harm our reputation. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on home builders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain building components such as lumber.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of state and Federal laws and regulations have been enacted or proposed that deal with the effect of climate change on the environment. These laws and regulations, which are generally intended to directly or indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve water or limit other potential climate change impacts, may impose restrictions or additional requirements on land development and home construction in certain areas. Such restrictions and requirements could increase our operating and compliance costs or require additional technology and capital investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations. This is a particular concern in the western United States, where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted, and where we have significant business operations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing climate-related government regulations applicable to our business, and such compliance has not had a material impact on our business. However, given the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws and matters that may arise that are not currently known, we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters, and our future costs to achieve compliance or remedy potential violations could be significant.\nAdditionally, increased governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control,\nassess and report. These factors may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to adequately address such ESG matters or fail to comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.\nFailure by our employees or representatives to comply with laws and regulations may harm us.\nWe are required to comply with laws and regulations that govern all aspects of our business including land acquisition, development, home construction, labor and employment, mortgage origination, title and escrow operations, sales, and warranty. It is possible that our employees or entities engaged by us, such as subcontractors, could intentionally or unintentionally violate some of these laws and regulations. Although we endeavor to take immediate action if we become aware of such violations, we may incur fines or penalties as a result of these actions and our reputation with governmental agencies and our customers could be damaged.\nComponent shortages and increased costs of labor and supplies are beyond our control and can result in delays and increased costs to develop our communities.\nOur ability to develop residential communities may be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control, including work stoppages, labor disputes, and shortages of qualified trades people, such as carpenters, roofers, masons, electricians, and plumbers; changes in laws relating to union organizing activity; lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services; our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured; the ability of municipalities to process permits, conduct inspections and take similar actions in a timely manner; and shortages, delays in availability, or fluctuations in prices of building components and materials. Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities. We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising our home prices because the price for each home is typically set months prior to its delivery pursuant to the agreement of sale with the home buyer. If that happens, our operating results could be harmed.\nOver the past several years, strong demand for homes combined with supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and municipal related delays has caused our construction cycle to lengthen and the costs of building materials to increase. Longer construction cycles can lead to increased cancellation rates. In addition, shortages and cost increases in building materials and tightness in the labor market can erode our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations, especially if such disruptions, shortages and delays persist for extended periods of time.\nWe are subject to one collective bargaining agreement that covers less than 2% of our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages due to strikes by unionized workers, but we cannot make assurances that there will not be any work stoppages due to strikes or other job actions in the future. We engage independent contractors that employ non-unionized workers to construct our homes. At any given point in time, the employees of those subcontractors, who are not yet represented by a union, may be unionized.\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations.\nWe are in the midst of a multi-year process of implementing a complex new enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP implementation requires the integration of the new ERP with multiple new and existing information systems and business processes, and has been designed to accurately maintain our books and records and provide information to our management teams important to the operation of the business. Our ERP implementation will continue to require ongoing investment. If the system as it currently stands or after necessary investments does not result in our ability to maintain accurate books and records, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, conversion from our old system to the ERP may cause inefficiencies until the ERP is stabilized and mature. The implementation of our ERP mandated new procedures and many new controls over financial reporting. These procedures and controls are not yet mature in their operation and not fully tested by our internal auditors. If we are unable to adequately implement and maintain procedures and controls relating to our ERP, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired and impact our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Financing\nIf we are not able to obtain suitable financing, or if the interest rates on our debt are increased, or if our credit ratings are lowered, our business and results of operations may decline.\nOur business and results of operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing, whether from bank borrowings or from financing in the public debt markets. Substantial portions of our revolving credit facility, which provides for approximately $1.90 billion in committed borrowing capacity, and our $650.0 million term loan mature in November 2026,\nwith smaller portions maturing in November 2025. In addition, $400.0 million of our senior notes become due and payable in April 2023 and $1.60 billion of our senior notes become due and payable at various times from November 2025 through November 2029. We cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find additional sources of financing in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we are not able to obtain suitable financing at reasonable terms or replace existing debt and credit facilities when they become due or expire, our costs for borrowings may increase and our revenues may decrease or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels.\nIncreases in interest rates can make it more difficult and/or expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business. The amount of interest we incur on our revolving bank credit facility and term loan (exclusive of the amount we have hedged with interest rate swap transactions as further described in Note 6 - Loans Payable, Senior Notes, and Mortgage Company Loan Facility in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K) fluctuates based on changes in short-term interest rates and the amount of borrowings we incur. Increases in interest rates generally and/or any downgrade in the ratings that national rating agencies assign to our outstanding debt securities could increase the interest rates we must pay on any subsequent issuances of debt securities, and any such ratings downgrade could also make it more difficult for us to sell such debt securities.\nIf home buyers are not able to obtain suitable financing, our results of operations may decline.\nOur results of operations also depend on the ability of our potential home buyers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes. Mortgage rates increased significantly during fiscal 2022, which has impacted the demand for our homes during the second half of fiscal 2022, and market conditions and/or government actions could cause mortgage rates to increase even further in the future. Any uncertainty in the mortgage markets and its impact on the overall mortgage market, including the tightening of credit standards, future increases in the effective cost of home mortgage financing (including as a result of changes to federal tax law), and increased government regulation, could adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for a home purchase, thus preventing our potential home buyers from purchasing our homes. In addition, where our potential home buyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us, increases in mortgage costs and/or lack of availability of mortgages could prevent the buyers of our potential home buyers existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete their purchases, which would result in our potential home buyers inability to buy a home from us. Similar risks apply to those buyers whose contracts are in our backlog of homes to be delivered. If our home buyers, potential buyers, or buyers of our home buyers current homes cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our ability to resell mortgages to investors is impaired, our home buyers may be required to find alternative financing.\nGenerally, when our mortgage subsidiary closes a mortgage for a home buyer at a previously locked-in rate, it already has an agreement in place with an investor to acquire the mortgage following the closing. Our mortgage loans are sold to investors with limited recourse provisions derived from industry-standard representations and warranties in the relevant agreements. These representations and warranties primarily involve the absence of misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties, the appropriate underwriting of the loan and in some cases, a required minimum number of payments to be made by the borrower. We generally do not retain any other continuing interest related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. However, if these recourse provisions are not satisfied, the mortgage loans sold to investors could be returned to us. In addition, if the resale market for our mortgages decline or the underwriting standards of our investors become more stringent, our ability to sell future mortgage loans could be adversely affected and either we would have to commit our own funds to long-term investments in mortgage loans, which could, among other things, delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations, or our home buyers would be required to find an alternative source of financing. If our home buyers cannot obtain another source of financing in order to purchase our homes, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Other Events and Factors\nPublic health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk. In 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, including the closures of non-essential businesses for a period of time. These restrictions had an adverse impact on our business in the spring of 2020. However, following the initial onset of the pandemic, economic activity resumed and demand for our homes improved significantly in the remainder of fiscal 2020 and remained strong through the first half of fiscal 2022. The effects of the pandemic on economic activity, combined with the strong demand for new homes, caused many disruptions to our supply chain\nand shortages in certain building components and materials, as well as labor shortages. These conditions caused our construction cycles to lengthen.\nThere is continuing uncertainty regarding how long the impacts of COVID-19 will affect the U.S. economy and our supply chain and operations. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including whether there is a resurgence in the pandemic and whether variant strains emerge, and the extent of any containment or mitigation measures on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain, unpredictable and outside our control. If COVID-19 or any of its variants continues to have a significant negative impact on the economy, or if a new pandemic emerges, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions could disrupt the development of our communities, which could harm our sales and results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, and wildfires, can have serious effects on our ability to develop our residential communities. We also may be affected by unforeseen engineering, environmental, or geological conditions or problems, including conditions or problems which arise on lands of third parties in the vicinity of our communities, but nevertheless negatively impact our communities. Any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in or prevent the completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our residential communities and, as a result, could harm our sales and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreased domestic or international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nIncreased domestic or international instability could adversely impact the economy and significantly reduce demand for homes and the number of new contracts we sign, increase the number of cancellations of existing contracts, and/or increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the loss of key management personnel or if we fail to attract qualified personnel.\nOur future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract qualified personnel. Our operations could be adversely affected if key members of our senior management leave the Company or we cannot attract qualified personnel to manage our business.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities as well as maintain our business records, including information provided by our customers. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional breach or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources could impair our operations, damage our reputation, and cause us to lose customers, sales and revenue.\nIn addition, breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information, about our employees, consumers who view our homes, home buyers, mortgage loan applicants and business partners, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve these kinds of issues. The release of confidential information may lead to identity theft and related fraud, litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Depending on its nature, a particular breach or series of breaches of our systems may result in the unauthorized use, appropriation or loss of confidential or proprietary information on a one-time or continuing basis, which may not be detected for a period of time. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats, as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) could be material.\nIn recent years, we have been subject to cyber incidents including an attack that temporarily disrupted access to certain of our systems and an incident involving identity theft through the unauthorized access of one of our third-party service providers information systems. Neither of these incidents individually or in the aggregate resulted in any material liability to us, any\nmaterial damage to our reputation, or any material disruption to our operations. However, as a result of a widespread increase in the frequency and number of cyber-attacks, we expect that we will continue to be the target of additional and increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and data security breaches, and the safeguards we have designed to help prevent these incidents from occurring may not be successful. Any further increase in the frequency or scope of cyber-attacks may exacerbate these data security risks. If we experience additional cyber-attacks or data security breaches in the future, we could suffer material liabilities, our reputation could be materially damaged, and our operations could be materially disrupted. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nHeadquarters\nOur corporate office, which we lease from an unrelated party, contains approximately 163,000 square feet and is located in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.\nManufacturing/Distribution Facilities\nWe own a manufacturing facility of approximately 225,000 square feet located in Morrisville, Pennsylvania and a manufacturing facility totaling approximately 150,000 square feet located in Emporia, Virginia. We also lease, from unrelated parties, a facility of approximately 56,000 square feet located in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania and two facilities of approximately 38,000 square feet, on a combined basis, located in Westfield, Massachusetts. In addition, we own a 34,000-square foot manufacturing, warehouse, and office facility in Culpepper, Virginia. At these facilities, our Toll Integrated Systems subsidiary manufactures open wall panels, roof and floor trusses, and certain interior and exterior millwork to supply a portion of our construction needs. These facilities supply components used in our North, Mid-Atlantic, and portions of our South geographic regions. These operations also permit us to purchase wholesale lumber, sheathing, windows, doors, certain other interior and exterior millwork, and other building materials to supply to our communities. We believe that increased efficiencies, cost savings, quality control and productivity result from the operation of these plants and from the wholesale purchase of materials. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in various claims and litigation arising principally in the ordinary course of business. We believe that adequate provision for resolution of all current claims and pending litigation has been made and that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity or on our financial condition. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nShares of our common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TOL. At December 14, 2022, there were approximately 110,727,000 record holders of our common stock.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the three months ended October 31, 2022, we repurchased the following shares of our common stock:\nPeriod Total number\nof shares\npurchased (a) Average\nprice\npaid per share Total number\nof shares\npurchased as\npart of a\npublicly\nannounced plan or program (b) Maximum\nnumber\nof shares that\nmay yet be\npurchased\nunder the plan or program (b)\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in thousands)\nAugust 1, 2022 to August 31, 2022 - $ - - 18,319\nSeptember 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022 3,695 $ 42.48 3,695 14,624\nOctober 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022 47 $ 40.43 47 14,577\nTotal 3,742 3,742\n(a) Our stock incentive plans permit us to withhold from the total number of shares that otherwise would be issued to a performance based restricted stock unit recipient or a restricted stock unit recipient upon distribution that number of shares having a fair value at the time of distribution equal to the applicable income tax withholdings due and remit the remaining shares to the recipient. During the three months ended October 31, 2022, we withheld 1,528 of the shares subject to performance based restricted stock units and restricted stock units to cover approximately $68,500 of income tax withholdings and we issued the remaining 4,298 shares to the recipients. The shares withheld are not included in the total number of shares purchased in the table above.\nOur stock incentive plans also permit participants to exercise non-qualified stock options using a net exercise method. In a net exercise, we generally withhold from the total number of shares that otherwise would be issued to the participant upon exercise of the stock option that number of shares having a fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the option exercise price and applicable income tax withholdings, and remit the remaining shares to the participant. During the three-month period ended October 31, 2022, the net exercise method was not employed to exercise options.\n(b) On May 17, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchases), issuer tender offers or other financial arrangements or transactions for general corporate purposes, including to obtain shares for the Companys equity award and other employee benefit plans. This authorization terminated, effective May 17, 2022, the prior authorization that had been in effect since March 10, 2020. Our Board of Directors did not fix any expiration date for the current share repurchase program.\nOur revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement each require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth (as defined in the respective agreements), which limit the amount of share repurchases we may make. Based upon these provisions, our ability to repurchase our common stock was limited to approximately $4.47 billion as of October 31, 2022.\nDividends\nDuring fiscal 2022, we paid aggregate cash dividends of $0.77 per share to our shareholders. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and any decision to pay dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividend, will depend upon an evaluation of a number of factors, including our results of operations, our capital requirements, our operating and financial condition, and any contractual limitations then in effect. Our revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement each require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth (as defined in the respective agreement), which\nrestricts the amount of dividends we may pay. At October 31, 2022, under the provisions of our revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement, we could have paid up to approximately $3.72 billion of cash dividends.\nStockholder Return Performance Graph\nThe following graph and chart compares the five-year cumulative total return (assuming that an investment of $100 was made on October 31, 2017, and that dividends were reinvested) from October 31, 2017 to October 31, 2022, for (a) our common stock, (b) the S&P Homebuilding Index and (c) the S&P 500\u00ae:\nComparison of 5 Year Cumulative Total Return Among Toll Brothers, Inc., the S&P 500\u00ae, and\nthe S&P Homebuilding Index\nOctober 31: 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nToll Brothers, Inc. $ 100.00 $ 73.89 $ 88.34 $ 95.15 $ 136.97 $ 99.58\nS&P 500\u00ae\n$ 100.00 $ 107.35 $ 122.72 $ 134.64 $ 192.42 $ 164.31\nS&P Homebuilding Index $ 100.00 $ 80.36 $ 117.66 $ 138.10 $ 183.16 $ 155.88 ITEM 6.

We cater to luxury first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, and second-home buyers in the United States, as well as urban and suburban renters. We also design, build, market, and sell high-density, high-rise urban luxury condominiums with third-party joint venture partners through Toll Brothers City Living\u00ae (City Living). At October 31, 2022, we were operating in 24 states and in the District of Columbia.\nIn the five years ended October 31, 2022, we delivered 45,369 homes from 904 communities, including 10,515 homes from 492 communities in fiscal 2022. At October 31, 2022, we had 981 communities in various stages of planning, development or operations containing approximately 76,000 home sites that we owned or controlled through options.\nWe operate our own architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, land development, insurance, smart home technology, and landscaping subsidiaries. In addition, in certain regions we operate our own lumber distribution, house component assembly and component manufacturing operations.\nWe are developing several land parcels for master-planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. One of these master-planned communities is being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners.\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. See the section entitled Toll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living below.\nWe have investments in various unconsolidated entities, including our Land Development Joint Ventures, Home Building Joint Ventures, Rental Property Joint Ventures and Gibraltar Joint Ventures.\nFinancial Highlights\nIn fiscal 2022, we recognized $10.28 billion of revenues, consisting of $9.71 billion of home sales revenues and $564.4 million of land sales and other revenues, and net income of $1.29 billion, as compared to $8.79 billion of revenues, consisting of $8.43 billion of home sales revenues and $358.6 million of land sales and other revenues, and net income of $833.6 million in fiscal 2021.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, the value of net contracts signed was $9.07 billion (8,255 homes) and $11.54 billion (12,472 homes), respectively. The value of our backlog at October 31, 2022 was $8.87 billion (8,098 homes), as compared to our backlog at October 31, 2021 of $9.50 billion (10,302 homes).\nAt October 31, 2022, we had $1.35 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.79 billion available for borrowing under our $1.905 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), substantially all of which matures in November 2026. At October 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $117.7 million.\nAt October 31, 2022, our total equity and our debt to total capitalization ratio were $6.02 billion and 0.36 to 1.00, respectively.\nAcquisitions\nAs part of our strategy to expand our geographic footprint and product offerings, in fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a privately-held home builder with operations in San Antonio, Texas for approximately $48.1 million in cash. The assets acquired, which consisted of 16 communities, were primarily inventory, including approximately 450 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements.\nIn fiscal 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a privately-held home builder serving the Las Vegas, Nevada market, for approximately $38.8 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory for future communities, including approximately 550 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements.\nThese acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and were not material to our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Business Environment and Current Outlook\nWe entered fiscal year 2022 with a strong backlog of 10,302 homes valued at $9.5 billion. During the year, we delivered 10,515 homes at an average delivered price of $923,600, increasing home sales revenues by 15.2% to $9.7 billion compared to $8.4 billion in fiscal year 2021. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 3,765 homes at an average price of $951,100 as compared to 3,341 homes and $883,100 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. These results reflect the robust housing market and strong demand for our homes that we experienced beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Since then, overall demand for new homes has significantly weakened, which we primarily attribute to the steep increases in mortgage rates during 2022. Corresponding with the weakened housing market, we experienced a significant decline in demand for our homes in the second half of fiscal year 2022. In the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2022, we signed 2,452 net contracts with an aggregate value of $2.98 billion as compared to 6,111 net contracts with an aggregate value of $5.98 billion in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2021, representing a year-over-year decline of 60% in units and 56% in dollars. In light of continued uncertainty regarding the direction of mortgage rates and overall macro-economic conditions, it is unclear whether demand for new homes will improve in the near term. However, over the long term, we believe that the housing market will continue to benefit from strong fundamentals, including demographic and migration trends and an overall shortage of homes in the United States.\nOur backlog at October 31, 2022 was 8,098 homes and $8.87 billion, down 21% in units and 7% in dollars, as compared to our backlog at October 31, 2021. We continue to experience extended build times (the time it takes from contract signing to delivery of the completed home) due to the impacts of supply chain, labor and other disruptions that characterized the home construction industry during fiscal 2022. However, with weakness in the housing market and fewer home starts in the overall market, we expect these disruptions to recede. In addition, we continue to work with our suppliers and trade partners to resolve issues that arise.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe home building business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that may have acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily based on price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. We believe our financial stability, relative to many others in our industry, provides us with a competitive advantage.\nLand Acquisition and Development\nOur business is subject to many risks because of the extended length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property, complete the land improvements on it, and build and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale. We attempt to reduce some of these risks and improve our capital efficiency by utilizing one or more of the following methods: controlling land for future development through options, which enables us to obtain necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land; generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer; and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed-price basis.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, we acquired control of approximately 5,700 and 27,700 home sites, respectively, net of options terminated and home sites sold. During fiscal year 2022, we forfeited control of over 9,000 lots subject to land purchase agreements primarily because the planned community no longer met our development criteria. At October 31, 2022, we controlled approximately 76,000 home sites, as compared to approximately 80,900 home sites at October 31, 2021, and approximately 63,200 home sites at October 31, 2020. In addition, at October 31, 2022, we expect to purchase approximately\n6,700 additional home sites from several Land Development Joint Ventures in which we have an interest, at prices not yet determined.\nOf the approximately 76,000 total home sites that we owned or controlled through options at October 31, 2022, we owned approximately 37,700 and controlled approximately 38,300 through options. Of the 76,000 home sites, approximately 17,400 were substantially improved.\nIn addition, at October 31, 2022, our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 24,300 home sites (including 409 home sites included in the 38,300 controlled through options).\nAt October 31, 2022, we were selling from 348 communities, compared to 340 communities at October 31, 2021, and 317 communities at October 31, 2020.\nCustomer Mortgage Financing\nWe maintain relationships with a diversified group of mortgage financial institutions, many of which are among the largest in the industry. We believe that national, regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with our home buyers, and these banks continue to provide these customers with financing.\nWe believe that our home buyers generally are, and should continue to be, well-positioned to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive credit profiles, as compared to the average home buyer.\nToll Brothers Apartment Living/Toll Brothers Campus Living\nIn addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments generally through joint ventures. At October 31, 2022, we or joint ventures in which we have an interest, controlled 73 land parcels that are planned as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 25,000 units. These projects, which are located in multiple metropolitan areas throughout the country, are being operated, are being developed, or will be developed with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living and Toll Brothers Campus Living.\nIn fiscal 2021, we announced a strategic partnership with Equity Residential to selectively acquire and develop sites for new rental apartment communities in metro Boston, MA; Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Denver, CO; Orange County/San Diego, CA; Seattle, WA; and Dallas-Fort Worth, TX. The strategic partnership has an initial term of three years. For selected projects, Equity Residential is expected to invest 75% of the equity and we are expected to invest the remaining 25% of the equity. It is expected that each project will also be financed with approximately 60% leverage. Equity Residential will have the option to acquire each property upon stabilization. The parties have targeted an initial minimum co-investment of $733.0 million in combined equity, or $1.83 billion in aggregate value, assuming 60% leverage. Through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into four joint ventures with Equity Residential under this arrangement. We also continue to evaluate potential strategic partnerships for our apartment projects in metro markets that are not designated to be developed exclusively with Equity Residential.\nIn fiscal 2022, one of our Rental Property Joint Ventures sold its assets to an unrelated party, resulting in a gain of $29.9 million recognized by the joint venture. From our investment in this joint venture, we received cash and recognized a gain of $21.0 million in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, five of our Rental Property Joint Ventures sold their assets to unrelated parties, resulting in an aggregate gain of $177.6 million recognized by the joint ventures. From our investments in these joint ventures, we received cash and recognized an aggregate gain of $74.8 million in fiscal 2021. The gains recognized from these sales are included in Income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income included in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K.\nAt October 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,000 units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy, 2,150 units in the lease-up stage, 7,900 units in the design phase or under development, and 10,950 units in the planning stage. Of the 25,000 units at October 31, 2022, 13,900 were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest; approximately 2,900 were owned by us; and 8,200 were under contract to be purchased by us.\nContracts and Backlog\nThe aggregate value of net sales contracts signed decreased 21% in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021. The value of net sales contracts signed was $9.07 billion (8,255 homes) in fiscal 2022 and $11.54 billion (12,472 homes) in fiscal 2021. The decrease in the aggregate value of net contracts signed in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was due to a 34% decrease in the number of net contracts signed, offset by a 19% increase in the average value of each contract signed. The decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, reflects an overall moderation in demand from the extremely strong prior year primarily due to the steep increases in mortgage rates during 2022. The increase in average value attributed to each signed contracts signed in fiscal 2022 was principally due to price increases in many of our markets, as well\nas a shift in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products. The average value attributed to each contract signed includes the value of each binding agreement of sale that was signed in the period, as well as the value of all options selected during the period, regardless of when the initial agreement of sale related to such options was signed.\nThe value of our backlog at October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $8.87 billion (8,098 homes), $9.50 billion (10,302 homes), and $6.37 billion (7,791 homes), respectively. Approximately 90% of the homes in backlog at October 31, 2022 are expected to be delivered by October 31, 2023. The 7% decrease in the value of homes in backlog at October 31, 2022, as compared to October 31, 2021, was due to the delivery of more homes out of backlog than were added during fiscal 2022, offset, in part, by an increase in the average value of each contract signed.\nFor more information regarding revenues, net contracts signed, and backlog by geographic segment, see Segments in this MD&A.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates are based on (i) currently known facts and circumstances, (ii) prior experience, (iii) assessments of probability, (iv) forecasted financial information, and (v) assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We use our best judgment when measuring these estimates, and if warranted, obtain advice from external sources. On an ongoing basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. In times of economic disruption when uncertainty regarding future economic conditions is heightened, these estimates and assumptions are subject to greater variability.\nFor a discussion of all our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1,Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the accounting estimates and assumptions described below involve significant subjectivity and judgment, and changes to such estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results. Therefore, we consider an understanding of the variability and judgment required in making these estimates and assumptions to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists, in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with GAAP. In addition to direct land acquisition, land development, and home construction costs, costs also include interest, real estate taxes, and direct overhead related to development and construction, which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. Because our inventory is considered a long-lived asset under GAAP, we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities when we believe the values are not recoverable.\nOperating Communities: When the profitability of an operating community deteriorates, the sales pace declines significantly, or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset, the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the communitys carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value reflects inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flows, as well as current risk-free rates available in the market and estimated market risk premiums. During the year ended October 31, 2022, we did not record any inventory impairment charges on our operating communities and therefore no discount rate was used. In estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community, we use various estimates such as (i) the expected sales pace in a community, based upon general economic conditions that will have a short-term or long-term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market, including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders; (ii) the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community; (iii) costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future, including, but not limited to, land and land development costs, home construction, interest, and overhead costs; (iv) alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace, sales price, building cost, or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community; and (v) alternative uses for the property, such as the possibility of a sale of the entire\ncommunity to another builder or the sale of individual home sites. Any impairment is charged to cost of home sales revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined.\nFuture Communities: We evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities, whether owned or optioned, to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated. This evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above, as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals, the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals, alternative land uses and the possible concessions that may be required to be given in order to obtain them. Concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets, dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space, or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built or commitment to build or fund certain dedicated workforce and affordable housing units. Based upon this review, we decide (i) as to land under contract to be purchased, whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated, and (ii) as to land we own, whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner, or should be sold. We then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off. The write-off is charged to cost of home sales revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined.\nThe estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess possible impairments during the past three fiscal years.\nWe recognized inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, as shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nLand controlled for future communities $ 13,051 $ 5,620 $ 23,539\nLand owned for future communities 19,690 19,805 31,669\nOperating communities - 1,110 675\n$ 32,741 $ 26,535 $ 55,883\nCost of Revenue Recognition\nCost of revenues from home sales are recognized at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.\nFor our standard attached and detached homes, land, land development, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes expected to be constructed in each community. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community. Home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method. For our master-planned communities, the estimated land, common area development, and related costs, including the cost of golf courses, net of their estimated residual value, are allocated to individual communities within a master-planned community on a relative sales value basis. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master-planned community.\nFor high-rise/mid-rise projects, land, land development, construction, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered.\nWe rely on certain estimates to determine our construction and land development costs. Construction and land costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs, including estimated future costs. In determining these costs, we compile community budgets that are based on a variety of assumptions, including future construction schedules and costs to be incurred. Actual results can differ from budgeted amounts for various reasons, including construction delays, labor or material shortages, slower absorptions, increases in costs that have not yet been committed, changes in governmental requirements, or other unanticipated\nissues encountered during construction and development and other factors beyond our control. To address uncertainty in these budgets, we assess, update and revise community budgets on a regular basis, utilizing the most current information available to estimate home construction and land costs.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used in developing and revising community budgets over the past three fiscal years.\nWarranty and Self-Insurance\nWarranty: We provide all of our home buyers with a limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. We also provide many of our home buyers with a limited 10-year warranty as to structural integrity. We accrue for expected warranty costs at the time each home is closed and title and possession are transferred to the home buyer. Warranty costs are accrued based upon historical experience related to product type, geographic location and other community specific factors. Adjustments to our warranty liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs. Over the past decade, we have had a significant number of warranty claims related primarily to homes built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 7, Accrued Expenses in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these warranty charges. We have not made any material changes in our methodology or significant assumptions used to establish our warranty reserves during the past three fiscal years.\nSelf-Insurance: We maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our home building activities, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits (self-insured liability). We also provide general liability insurance for our subcontractors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, and certain areas of Texas, where eligible subcontractors are enrolled as insureds under our general liability insurance policies in each community in which they perform work. For those enrolled subcontractors, we absorb their general liability associated with the work performed on our homes within the applicable community as part of our overall general liability insurance and our self-insurance through our captive insurance subsidiary.\nWe record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability and the estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR).\nWe engage a third-party actuary that uses our historical claim and expense data, input from our internal legal and risk management groups, as well as industry data, to estimate our liabilities related to unpaid claims, IBNR associated with the risks that we are assuming for our self-insured liability and other required costs to administer current and expected claims. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, the most significant being the long period of time between the delivery of a home to a home buyer and when a structural warranty or construction defect claim is made, and the ultimate resolution of the claim. Though state regulations vary, construction defect claims are reported and resolved over a prolonged period of time, which can extend for 10 years or longer. As a result, the majority of the estimated liability relates to IBNR. Adjustments to our liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs.\nThe projection of losses related to these liabilities requires actuarial assumptions that are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of product we build, insurance industry practices and legal or regulatory actions and/or interpretations, among other factors. Key assumptions used in these estimates include claim frequencies, severity and settlement patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. In addition, changes in the frequency and severity of reported claims and the estimates to settle claims can impact the trends and assumptions used in the actuarial analysis, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Due to the degree of judgment required, and the potential for variability in these underlying assumptions, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have not made any material changes in our methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves during the past three fiscal years. Over the past three fiscal years adjustments to our estimates have not been material.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis. A series of operating losses of an investee, the inability to recover our invested capital, or other factors may indicate that a loss in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred. If a loss exists, we further review to determine if the loss is other than temporary, in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\nThe evaluation of our investments in unconsolidated entities for other-than-temporary impairment entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates, including but not limited to: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors. For our unconsolidated entities that develop for-sale homes and condominiums these other factors include those that are similar to how we evaluate our inventory for impairment as described above, such as expected sales pace, expected sales price, and costs incurred and anticipated. For our unconsolidated entities that own, develop and manage for-rent residential apartments, these other factors may include rental trends, expected future expenses and cap rates. Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are also dependent on market conditions, sufficiency of financing and capital and competition.\nWe believe our assumptions on discount rates require significant judgment because the selection of the discount rate may significantly impact the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. During the year ended October 31, 2022, we utilized discount rates ranging from 12% to 15% in our valuations. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table compares certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and other supplemental information for fiscal 2022 and 2021 ($ amounts in millions, unless otherwise stated).

The increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, is principally due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2021, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2020, partially offset by lower backlog conversion in fiscal 2022, primarily due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and municipality-related delays. The increase in the average delivered home price was mainly due to our ability to raise prices in the first half of our fiscal year when the housing market was strong, as well as an increase in homes delivered in more expensive product types/geographic regions.\nHome sales cost of revenues, as a percentage of homes sales revenues, in fiscal 2022 was 74.5%, as compared to 77.5% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in fiscal 2022 was principally due to a shift in the mix of revenues to higher margin products/areas, sales price increases outpacing cost increases, and lower interest expense as a percentage of home sales revenues. Interest cost in fiscal 2022 was $164.8 million or 1.7% of home sales revenues, as compared to $187.2 million or 2.2% of home sales revenues in fiscal 2021. We recognized inventory impairments and write-offs of $32.7 million or 0.3% of home sales revenues and $26.5 million or 0.3% of home sales revenues in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nLand Sales and Other Revenues and Land Sales and Other Cost of Revenues\nOur revenues from land sales and other generally consist of the following: (1) land sales to joint ventures in which we retain an interest; (2) lot sales to third-party builders within our master-planned communities; (3) bulk land sales to third parties of land we have decided no longer meets our development criteria; and (4) sales of commercial and retail properties generally located at our City Living buildings. Land sales to joint ventures in which we retain an interest are generally sold at our land basis and therefore little to no gross margin is earned on these sales.\nIn fiscal 2022, we sold nine land parcels to newly formed Rental Property Joint Ventures in which we have an interest for approximately $322.3 million. Minimal gains were recognized on these land sales to joint ventures. In addition, during fiscal 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.2 million related to office space associated with certain Hoboken, New Jersey condominium projects in connection with a planned sale. During fiscal 2021, we sold a parking garage and retail space associated with certain Hoboken, New Jersey condominium projects for $82.4 million and we recognized gains of $38.3 million. In addition, in fiscal 2021, we sold ten land parcels to newly formed Rental Property Joint Ventures in which we have an interest for $227.8 million. No gains were recognized on these land sales to joint ventures.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)\nSG&A spending increased by $55.7 million in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021. As a percentage of home sales revenues, SG&A was 10.1% and 10.9% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The dollar increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher headcount and additional investments in information technology in addition to normal compensation increases, offset by reduced commissions due to lower broker co-op rates. In addition, fiscal 2022 includes a $10.0 million charge for a charitable contribution made to the Toll Brothers Foundation. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of revenues was due to a 15% increase in revenues and reduced commission rates in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021.\nIncome from Unconsolidated Entities\nWe recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from the various unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment. Many of our unconsolidated entities are land development projects, high-rise/mid-rise condominium construction projects, or for-rent apartment projects and for-rent single-family home projects, which do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property. Once development is complete for land development projects and high-rise/mid-rise condominium construction projects, these unconsolidated entities will generally, over a relatively short period of time, generate revenues and earnings until all of the assets of the entity are sold. Further, once for-rent apartments and for-rent single-family home projects are complete and stabilized, we may monetize a portion of these projects through a recapitalization or a sale of all or a portion of our ownership interest in the joint venture, resulting in an income-producing event. Because of the long development periods associated with these entities, the earnings recognized from these entities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nFor our Rental Property Joint Ventures specifically, these entities typically generate operating losses until the related property reaches stabilization. For the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our earnings related to the Rental Property Joint Ventures include approximately $17.5 million and $18.1 million of our share of net operating losses incurred by these joint ventures, respectively, of which approximately $21.7 million and $17.8 million was our share of the depreciation expense recognized by these joint ventures, respectively.\nThe decrease in income from unconsolidated entities from $74.0 million in fiscal 2021 to $23.7 million in fiscal 2022, was due mainly to a $74.8 million of gains related to property sales by five of our Rental Property Joint Ventures and a $6.0 million gain related to an asset sale of commercial property by one of our Land Development Joint Ventures in the fiscal 2021 period. In the fiscal 2022 period we recognized a $21.0 million gain related to a property sale by one of our Rental Property Joint Ventures, higher income by a joint venture that owns a hotel and increased earnings from our Land Development Joint Ventures due to lot sales. In addition, during the fiscal 2022 period, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges on our investments in certain Home Building and Rental Property Joint Ventures of $8.0 million compared to $2.1 million in the fiscal 2021 period.\nOther Income - Net\nThe table below provides the components of Other Income - net for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nIncome from ancillary businesses $ 24,668 $ 36,711\nManagement fee income from Land Development and Home Building Joint Ventures - net\n7,968 1,646\nGain on litigation settlement - net 141,234 -\nOther (2,493) 2,257\nTotal other income - net\n$ 171,377 $ 40,614\nThe decrease in income from ancillary businesses in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was principally due to lower earnings from our mortgage operations due to lower volume and increased competition, as well as higher operating losses incurred in our apartment living operations. This decrease was partially offset by a gain of $9.0 million related to the bulk sale of security monitoring accounts by our smart home technologies business in fiscal 2022.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2022 and 2021, our apartment living operations earned fees from unconsolidated entities of $23.2 million and $20.2 million, respectively. Fees earned by our apartment living operations are included in income from ancillary businesses.\nManagement fee income from Home Building and Land Development Joint Ventures - net includes fees earned by our City Living and home building operations. The increase in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily related to an increase in Joint Ventures to which we provide services.\nIn fiscal 2022, we entered into a $192.5 million settlement agreement with Southern California Gas Company to resolve our claims associated with a natural gas leak that occurred from October 2015 through February 2016 at the Aliso Canyon underground storage facility located near certain of our communities in southern California. As a result, net of legal fees and expenses, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $148.4 million, of which $141.2 million was recorded in Other Income - net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in fiscal 2022. The remainder was recorded as an offset to previously incurred expenses. No similar gains were incurred in fiscal 2021.\nExpenses Related to Early Retirement of Debt\nIn fiscal 2021, we redeemed, prior to maturity, all $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024. In connection with this redemption, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $34.2 million, inclusive of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, which is recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income. No similar charges were incurred in fiscal 2022.\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nIn fiscal 2022, we reported income before income taxes of $1.70 billion or 16.6% of revenues, as compared to $1.10 billion, or 12.5% of revenues in fiscal 2021.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe recognized a $417.2 million income tax provision in fiscal 2022. Based upon the federal statutory rate of 21.0% for fiscal 2022, our federal tax provision would have been $357.8 million. The difference between the tax provision recognized and the tax provision based on the federal statutory rate was mainly due to the provision for state income taxes of $75.5 million and $4.4 million of other permanent differences, offset, in part, by a $22.2 million benefit of federal energy efficient home credits; a benefit of $3.0 million from excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation; and the reversal of $1.7 million of previously accrued tax provisions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nWe recognized a $266.7 million income tax provision in fiscal 2021. Based upon the federal statutory rate of 21.0% for fiscal 2021, our federal tax provision would have been $231.1 million. The difference between the tax provision recognized and the tax provision based on the federal statutory rate was mainly due to the provision for state income taxes of $50.2 million and $8.4 million of other permanent differences, offset, in part, by a $24.3 million benefit of federal energy efficient home credits; a benefit of $4.7 million from excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation; and the reversal of $1.0 million of previously accrued tax provisions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nFunding for our business has been, and continues to be, provided principally by cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions, unsecured bank borrowings, and the public debt markets.\nOur cash flows from operations generally provide us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Our primary uses of cash include inventory additions in the form of land acquisitions and deposits to obtain control of land, land development, working capital to fund day to day operations, and investments in existing and future unconsolidated joint ventures. We may also use cash to fund capital expenditures such as investments in our information technology systems. From time to time we use some or all of the remaining available cash flow to repay debt, and to fund share repurchases and dividends on our common stock. We believe our sources of cash and liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our strategic operating initiatives, repay debt, fund our share repurchases and pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nAt October 31, 2022, we had $1.35 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and approximately $1.79 billion available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nFor at least the next twelve months, we expect our principal demand for funds will be for inventory additions in the form of land acquisition, deposits to control land and land development, operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses, investments and funding of capital improvements, investments in existing and future unconsolidated joint ventures, debt repayment (including the $400.0 million principal payment on our 4.375% Senior Notes due April 15, 2023), common stock repurchases, and dividend payments. Demand for funds include interest and principal payments on current and future debt financing. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through our cash and cash equivalents on hand and net cash flows provided by operations. Additional sources of funds include distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our mortgage company loan facility, and borrowings from banks and other lenders. In addition, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $148 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 related to a litigation settlement.\nWe believe we will have sufficient liquidity available to fund our business needs, commitments and contractual obligations in a timely manner for the next twelve months. We may, however, seek additional financing to fund future growth, refinance our existing indebtedness, or for other purposes. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nBeyond the next twelve months, we expect that our principal demand for funds will be for payment of the principal on our long-term debt as it becomes due or matures, land purchases and inventory additions, long-term capital investments and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, common stock repurchases, and dividend payments.\nOver the longer term, to the extent the sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet our needs, we may also conduct additional public offerings of our securities, refinance debt or dispose of certain assets to fund our operating activities, debt service, dividends and common stock repurchases. We expect these resources will be adequate to fund our ongoing operating activities as well as providing capital for investment in future land purchases and related development activities and future joint ventures.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe are a party to many contractual obligations and commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2022, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, payments due on our Mortgage Company Loan Facility, purchase obligations related to expected acquisition of land under purchase agreements and land development\nagreements (many of which are secured by letters of credit or surety bonds), operating leases, and obligations under our deferred compensation plan, supplemental executive retirement plans, and 401(k) savings plans. We also enter into certain short-term lease commitments, commitments to fund our existing or future unconsolidated joint ventures, letters of credit and other purchase obligations in the normal course of business. For more information regarding our primary obligations, refer to Note 6, Loans Payable, Senior Notes, and Mortgage Company Loan Facility, and Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for amounts outstanding as of October 31, 2022, related to debt and commitments and contingencies, respectively.\nWe also operate through a number of joint ventures and have undertaken various commitments as a result of those arrangements. At October 31, 2022, we had investments in these entities of $852.3 million, and were committed to invest or advance up to an additional $304.3 million to these entities if they require additional funding. We expect to purchase approximately 6,700 home sites over a number of years from several of these joint ventures. The purchase price of these home sites will be determined at a future date.\nThe unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have investments generally finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, we and our joint venture partner have guaranteed debt of unconsolidated entities. These guarantees may include any or all of the following: (i) project completion guarantees, including any cost overruns; (ii) repayment guarantees, generally covering a percentage of the outstanding loan; (iii) carry cost guarantees, which cover costs such as interest, real estate taxes, and insurance; (iv) an environmental indemnity provided to the lender that holds the lender harmless from and against losses arising from the discharge of hazardous materials from the property and non-compliance with applicable environmental laws; and (v) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity.\nIn situations where we have joint and several guarantees with our joint venture partner, we generally seek to implement a reimbursement agreement with our partner that provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share or agreed-upon share of the guarantee; however, we are not always successful. In addition, if the joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under such a reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share. We believe that as of October 31, 2022, in the event we had become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of an unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event, the collateral would have been sufficient to repay all or a significant portion of the obligation. If it were not, we and our partners would have needed to contribute additional capital to the entity. At October 31, 2022, we had guaranteed the debt of certain unconsolidated entities with loan commitments aggregating $2.86 billion, of which, if the full amount of the debt obligations were borrowed, we estimate $597.8 million to be our maximum exposure related to repayment and carry cost guarantees. At October 31, 2022, the unconsolidated entities had borrowed an aggregate of $1.11 billion, of which we estimate $390.5 million to be our maximum exposure related to repayment and carry cost guarantees. These maximum exposure estimates do not take into account any estimates related to the environmental or bad boy acts indemnifications provided to the lenders or recoveries from the underlying collateral or any reimbursement from our partners.\nFor more information regarding these joint ventures, see Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K.\nDebt Service Requirements\nOur financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced profile of debt maturities, and to manage our exposure to floating interest rate volatility.\nOutside of the normal course of operations, one of our principal liquidity needs is the payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness. We are required by the terms of certain loan documents to meet certain covenants, such as financial ratios and reporting requirements. As of October 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our term loan, credit facility and other loans payable. Refer to Note 6, Loans Payable, Senior Notes, and Mortgage Company Loan Facility in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was $986.8 million. Cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily from $1.29 billion of net income plus $21.1 million of stock-based compensation, $76.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $32.7 million of inventory impairments and write-offs, less $23.7 million of income from unconsolidated entities; an increase of $152.5 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses; an increase of $160.5 million in current income taxes, net; and an increase of $50.7 million in sale of mortgage loans, net of originations. This activity was offset, in part, by an increase of $618.8 million in inventory; a net deferred tax benefit of $96.7 million; and a decrease of $95.0 million in receivables, prepaid assets, and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.30 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily from $833.6 million of net income plus $23.2 million of stock-based compensation, $76.3 million of depreciation and amortization, $26.5 million of inventory impairments and write-offs, a net deferred tax benefit of $11.8 million, less $74.0 million of income from unconsolidated entities; an increase of $214.8 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses; an increase of $165.6 million in net customer deposits; and a decrease of $135.8 million in receivables, prepaid assets, and other assets. This activity was offset, in part, by an increase of $196.2 million in inventory; an increase of $18.6 million in mortgage loans held for sale; and a $38.7 million gain from the sale of assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was $153.2 million, primarily related to $226.7 million used to fund our investments in unconsolidated entities and $71.7 million for the purchase of property and equipment. This activity was offset, in part, by $116.8 million of cash received as returns from our investments in unconsolidated entities and $28.3 million of cash proceeds from the sale of assets.\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was $4.2 million, primarily related to $221.9 million used to fund investments in unconsolidated entities and $66.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment. This activity was offset, in part, by $203.5 million of cash received as returns on our investments in unconsolidated entities and proceeds of $80.4 million of cash received from sales of certain commercial properties.\nFinancing Activities\nWe used $1.12 billion of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2022, primarily for the redemption of $409.9 million of senior notes; the repurchase of $542.7 million of our common stock; payments of $51.6 million of loans payable, net of new borrowings; the payment of dividends on our common stock of $88.9 million and payments related to noncontrolling interest - net of $25.8 million.\nWe used $1.01 billion of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2021, primarily for the repurchase of $378.3 million of our common stock; repayments of $267.0 million of other loans payable, net of new borrowings; $294.2 million of redemption of senior notes, and payment of $76.6 million of dividends on our common stock, offset, in part, by the proceeds of $10.5 million from our stock-based benefit plans.\nINFLATION\nThe long-term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land, land development, construction, and overhead. We generally enter into contracts to acquire land a significant period of time before development and sales efforts begin. Accordingly, to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed, subsequent increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits. Because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction, any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins. We generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed-price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time, which generally do not exceed one year.\nIn general, housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs. For example, since the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022, overall demand for new homes has significantly weakened, which we primarily attribute to the high inflationary period and steep mortgage rate increases during 2022. Additionally, interest rates, the length of time that land remains in inventory, and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs. If we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage rates increase significantly, affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases, our home sales revenues, gross margins, and net income could be adversely affected. Increases in sales prices, whether the result of inflation or demand, may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes.\nSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION\nAt October 31, 2022, our 100%-owned subsidiary, Toll Brothers Finance Corp. (the Subsidiary Issuer), had issued and outstanding $2.00 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes maturing on various dates between April 15, 2023 and November 1, 2029 (the Senior Notes). For further information regarding the Senior Notes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Senior Notes.\nThe obligations of the Subsidiary Issuer to pay principal, premiums, if any, and interest are guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by us and substantially all of our 100%-owned home building subsidiaries (the Guarantor Subsidiaries and, together with us, the Guarantors). The guarantees are full and unconditional, and the Subsidiary Issuer and each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries are consolidated subsidiaries of Toll Brothers, Inc. Our non-home building subsidiaries and several of our home building subsidiaries (together, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries) do not guarantee the Senior Notes. The Subsidiary\nIssuer generates no operating revenues and does not have any independent operations other than the financing of our other subsidiaries by lending the proceeds of its public debt offerings, including the Senior Notes. Our home building operations are conducted almost entirely through the Guarantor Subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Subsidiary Issuers cash flow and ability to service the Senior Notes is dependent upon the earnings of the Companys subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Subsidiary Issuer, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the Senior Notes have a direct claim only against the Subsidiary Issuer and the Guarantors. The obligations of the Guarantors under their guarantees will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally) under applicable law.\nThe indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued provide that any of our subsidiaries that provide a guarantee of our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will guarantee the Senior Notes. The indentures further provide that any Guarantor Subsidiary may be released from its guarantee so long as (i) no default or event of default exists or would result from release of such guarantee; (ii) the Guarantor Subsidiary being released has consolidated net worth of less than 5% of the Companys consolidated net worth as of the end of our most recent fiscal quarter; (iii) the Guarantor Subsidiaries released from their guarantees in any fiscal year comprise in the aggregate less than 10% (or 15% if and to the extent necessary to permit the cure of a default) of our consolidated net worth as of the end of our most recent fiscal quarter; (iv) such release would not have a material adverse effect on ours and our subsidiaries home building business; and (v) the Guarantor Subsidiary is released from its guaranty under the Revolving Credit Facility. If there are no guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility, all Guarantor Subsidiaries under the indentures will be released from their guarantees.\nThe following summarized financial information is presented for Toll Brothers, Inc., the Subsidiary Issuer, and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among Toll Brothers, Inc., the Subsidiary Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.\nSummarized Balance Sheet Data (amounts in millions)\nOctober 31, 2022\nAssets\nCash $ 1,192.2\nInventory $ 8,564.3\nAmount due from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries $ 682.9\nTotal assets $ 11,156.5\nLiabilities & Stockholders' Equity\nLoans payable $ 1,135.6\nSenior notes $ 1,995.3\nTotal liabilities $ 5,591.0\nStockholders' equity $ 5,565.5\nSummarized Statement of Operations Data (amounts in millions)\nFor the\nyear ended October 31, 2022\nRevenues $ 9,812.2\nCost of revenues $ 7,385.5\nSelling, general and administrative $ 970.9\nIncome before income taxes $ 1,588.3\nNet income $ 1,199.4\nSEGMENTS\nWe operate in five geographic segments, with current operations generally located in the states listed below:\nEastern Region:\nThe North region: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania;\nThe Mid-Atlantic region: Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia;\nThe South region: Florida, South Carolina and Texas;\nWestern Region:\nThe Mountain region: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada and Utah; and\nThe Pacific region: California, Oregon and Washington.\nOur geographic reporting segments are consistent with how our chief operating decision makers are assessing operating performance and allocating capital. At October 31, 2022, we concluded that our City Living operations were no longer a reportable operating segment, primarily due to its insignificance as a result of the change in structure and shift in strategy for its operations. Therefore, we have five operating segments as reflected above. Amounts reported in prior periods have been restated to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation. The realignment did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, earnings per share or cash flows for the periods presented.\nThe following tables summarize information related to revenues, net contracts signed, and income (loss) before income taxes by segment for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal 2022 was principally due to sales price increases.\nThe decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was principally due to a decrease in the average number of selling communities, as well as a weakening in demand in the second half of fiscal 2022. The increase in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was mainly due to shifts in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products and price increases.\nThe decrease in income before income taxes in fiscal 2022 was principally attributable to lower earnings from decreased revenues, offset by lower home sales cost of revenues, as a percentage of home sales revenues. The decrease in home sales cost of revenues, as a percentage of home sales revenues in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a shift in product mix/areas to higher-margin areas and sales price increases. Furthermore, fiscal 2021 benefited from gains of $38.3 million recognized from the sales of a parking garage and retail space associated with one of our Hoboken, New Jersey condominium projects, offset by $2.1 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges that we recognized on two of our Home Building Joint Ventures.\nInventory impairment charges were $11.9 million in fiscal 2022, as compared to $12.2 million in fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we decided to sell a land parcel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that formerly was included in our City\nLiving segment. In connection with this planned sale, we recognized an impairment charge of $10.3 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we decided to sell the remaining lots in two communities, one in Connecticut and one in Illinois, in bulk sales. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nMid-Atlantic\nYear ended October 31,\n2022 2021 % Change\nUnits Delivered and Home Sales Revenues:\nHome sales revenues ($ in millions) $ 1,149.0 $ 1,076.9 7 %\nUnits delivered 1,222 1,402 (13) %\nAverage delivered price ($ in thousands)\n$ 940.3 $ 768.1 22 %\nNet Contracts Signed:\nNet contract value ($ in millions) $ 1,105.4 $ 1,310.7 (16) %\nNet contracted units 1,012 1,465 (31) %\nAverage contracted price ($ in thousands)\n$ 1,092.3 $ 894.7 22 %\nHome sales cost of revenues as a percentage of home sales revenues 76.1 % 80.0 %\nIncome before income taxes ($ in millions) $ 189.5 $ 128.5 47 %\nNumber of selling communities at October 31,\n40 38 5 %\nThe decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was mainly due to lower backlog conversion in fiscal 2022, partially offset by an increase in the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2021, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2020.

The decrease in home sales costs of revenues, as a percentage of home sale revenues, in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a shift in product mix/areas to higher-margin areas, lower interest costs as a percentage of home sales revenue and reduced inventory impairment charges. Included in fiscal 2021 income before income taxes was a $6.0 million gain recognized from an asset sale of a commercial property by one of our Land Development Joint Ventures.\nInventory impairment charges were $3.4 million and $12.0 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we decided to sell the remaining lots in one community located in Maryland in a bulk sale. As a result, we wrote down the carrying value of inventory in this community to its estimated fair value.

In connection with this planned sale, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.6 million.\nCorporate and Other\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, loss before income taxes was $98.6 million and $154.9 million respectively. The decrease in the loss before income taxes in fiscal 2022 was principally attributable to a favorable litigation settlement. As a result of the settlement, net of legal fees and expenses, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $148.4 million, of which $141.2 million was recorded in Other Income - net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in fiscal 2022. The remainder was recorded as an offset to previously incurred expenses. Coincident with this settlement, we made a charitable contribution of $10.0 million to the Toll Brothers Foundation, which was recorded in Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in fiscal 2022.\nIn addition, we incurred a $35.2 million charge related to the early retirement of debt in fiscal 2021. These decreases to loss before income taxes were offset by higher income generated by our Rental Property Joint Ventures in fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of $74.8 million of gains recognized related to property sales by five of our Rental Property Joint Ventures; lower earnings from our mortgage company due to a decrease in volume and increased interest spreads in fiscal 2022; higher SG&A costs in fiscal 2022 primarily due to normal compensation increases and additional investments in information technology, and higher losses incurred in our apartment living operations.\nFISCAL 2021 (Restated) COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 (Restated)\nNorth\nYear ended October 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\nUnits Delivered and Home Sales Revenues:\nHome sales revenues ($ in millions) $ 2,011.9 $ 1,480.2 36 %\nUnits delivered 2,503 2,103 19 %\nAverage delivered price ($ in thousands)\n$ 803.8 $ 703.9 14 %\nNet Contracts Signed:\nNet contract value ($ in millions) $ 1,996.4 $ 1,659.4 20 %\nNet contracted units 2,245 2,245 - %\nAverage contracted price ($ in thousands)\n$ 889.3 $ 739.2 20 %\nHome sales cost of revenues as a percentage of home sales revenues\n78.8 % 84.2 %\nIncome before income taxes ($ in millions)\n$ 313.7 $ 87.5 259 %\nNumber of selling communities at October 31, 66 73 (10) %\nThe increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2021 was mainly due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2020, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2019.

The decrease in losses from our investments in unconsolidated entities is primarily due to $6.0 million of other than temporary impairment charges that we recognized on one of our Home Building Joint Ventures in fiscal 2020.\nInventory impairment charges were $12.2 million in fiscal 2021, as compared to $28.4 million in fiscal 2020. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we decided to sell the remaining lots in two communities, one in Connecticut and one in Illinois, in bulk sales. As a result, we recognized impairment charges of $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we changed our strategy with respect to our land in the Delaware beach markets and the Chicago market. As a result, the carrying values of our land and communities were written down to their estimated fair values, which resulted in a charge to income before income taxes of $18.0 million in fiscal 2020 related to this land. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to a loss in lot density at one community located in New Jersey, the carrying value was written down to its estimated fair value, which resulted in a charge to income of $6.4 million.\nMid-Atlantic\nYear ended October 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\nUnits Delivered and Home Sales Revenues:\nHome sales revenues ($ in millions) $ 1,076.9 $ 851.1 27 %\nUnits delivered 1,402 1,274 10 %\nAverage delivered price ($ in thousands)\n$ 768.1 $ 668.1 15 %\nNet Contracts Signed:\nNet contract value ($ in millions) $ 1,310.7 $ 1,077.8 22 %\nNet contracted units 1,465 1,475 (1) %\nAverage contracted price ($ in thousands)\n$ 894.7 $ 730.7 22 %\nHome sales cost of revenues as a percentage of home sales revenues 80.0 % 83.7 %\nIncome before income taxes ($ in millions) $ 128.5 $ 52.0 147 %\nNumber of selling communities at October 31,\n38 39 (3) %\nThe increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was mainly due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2020, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2019, partially offset by lower backlog conversion in fiscal 2021. The increase in the average delivered price in fiscal 2021 was primarily due a shift in the number of homes delivered to more expensive areas and/or products, as well as sales price increases.\nThe decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was principally due to a decrease in the average number of selling communities, offset, in part, by an increase in demand. The increase in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to shifts in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products, as well as sales price increases in fiscal 2021.\nThe increase in income before income taxes in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was mainly due to higher earnings from increased revenues, coupled with lower home sales costs of revenues, as a percentage of home sale revenues. The decrease in home sales costs of revenues, as a percentage of home sale revenues, in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a shift in product mix/areas to higher-margin areas, lower interest costs as a percentage of home sales revenue and reduced inventory impairment charges. A $6.0 million gain recognized from an asset sale of a commercial property by one of our Land Development Joint Ventures was also recognized during fiscal 2021 with no similar gain in fiscal 2020.\nInventory impairment charges were $12.0 million and $17.9 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we decided to sell the remaining lots in one community located in Maryland in a bulk sale. As a result, we wrote down the carrying value of inventory in this community to its estimated fair value. This resulted in an impairment charge of $10.1 million in fiscal 2021. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we terminated a land purchase agreement in Virginia and wrote-off the deposits and soft costs incurred. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we decided to sell the remaining lots in one community located in Maryland in a bulk sale. As a result,\nwe wrote down the carrying value of inventory in this community to its estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment charge of $13.5 million in fiscal 2020.\nSouth\nYear ended October 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\nUnits Delivered and Home Sale Revenues:\nHome sales revenues ($ in millions) $ 1,183.3 $ 1,041.2 14 %\nUnits delivered 1,783 1,566 14 %\nAverage delivered price ($ in thousands)\n$ 663.7 $ 664.9 - %\nNet Contracts Signed:\nNet contract value ($ in millions) $ 2,109.6 $ 1,320.1 60 %\nNet contracted units 2,765 2,006 38 %\nAverage contracted price ($ in thousands)\n$ 763.0 $ 658.1 16 %\nHome sales cost of revenues as a percentage of home sales revenues 76.7 % 79.9 %\nIncome before income taxes ($ in millions)\n$ 153.8 $ 108.4 42 %\nNumber of selling communities at October 31,\n84 67 25 %\nThe increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was mainly due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2020, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2019, partially offset by lower backlog conversion in fiscal 2021.\nThe increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was principally due to an increase in demand from our homes and an increase in the average number of selling communities in fiscal 2021, offset by our limiting of lot releases in certain communities. The increases in the average value of each contract signed in the fiscal 2021 periods were primarily due to sales price increases in fiscal 2021 and a shift in the number of contracts signed to more expensive areas and/or products.\nThe increase in income before income taxes in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was principally due to higher earnings from increased home sales revenues and lower home sales costs of revenues, as a percentage of home sales revenues, offset, in part, by higher SG&A costs due to increased sales volume. The decrease in home sales cost of revenues, as a percentage of home sales revenues, was mainly due to a shift in product mix/areas to higher-margin areas, lower interest costs as a percentage of home sales revenue and lower inventory impairment changes in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.

The decrease in home sales cost of revenues, as a percentage of home sales revenues, was primarily due to a shift in product mix/areas to higher-margin areas.\nPacific\nYear ended October 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\nUnits Delivered and Home Sales Revenues:\nHome sales revenues ($ in millions) $ 2,156.1 $ 2,029.9 6 %\nUnits delivered 1,566 1,334 17 %\nAverage delivered price ($ in thousands)\n$ 1,376.8 $ 1,521.7 (10) %\nNet Contracts Signed:\nNet contract value ($ in millions) $ 2,781.7 $ 1,929.6 44 %\nNet contracted units 1,966 1,404 40 %\nAverage contracted price ($ in thousands)\n$ 1,414.9 $ 1,374.4 3 %\nHome sales cost of revenues as a percentage of home sales revenues 75.3 % 75.2 %\nIncome before income taxes ($ in millions)\n382.9 351.5 9 %\nNumber of selling communities at October 31,\n47 44 7 %\nThe increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was mainly due to an increase in the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2020, as compared to the number of homes in backlog at October 31, 2019, coupled\nwith higher backlog conversion in fiscal 2021.

The increase in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal 2021 was mainly due to price increases, partially offset by a shift in the number of contracts signed in less expensive areas.\nThe increase in income before income taxes in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to higher earnings from increased revenues, lower SG&A costs and lower inventory impairment charges. Inventory impairment charges were $1.3 million and $6.0 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2020 impairment charge relates primarily to a land purchase agreement where we no longer expected to purchase the land and, accordingly, wrote-off soft costs incurred.\nCorporate and Other\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, loss before income taxes was $154.9 million and $180.1 million respectively. The decrease in the loss before income taxes in fiscal 2021 was principally attributable to higher income generated by our Rental Property Joint Ventures primarily as a result of $74.8 million of gains recognized in the fiscal 2021 period related to property sales by five of our Rental Property Joint Ventures; higher earnings from our mortgage company and title company operations due to an increase in volumes and improved interest spreads in fiscal 2021; lower losses incurred in our apartment living operations; and directly expensed interest of $2.4 million in the fiscal 2020 period with no similar charges in fiscal 2021. These increases were offset, in part by a $35.2 million charge incurred related to early retirement of debt in fiscal 2021, lower interest income in fiscal 2021, gains recognized in fiscal 2020 of $13.0 million from the sale of golf club properties, and higher SG&A costs in fiscal 2021 primarily due to normal compensation increases and an increase in insurance costs due to higher revenues. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates. We incur both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. For fixed-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flow. Conversely, for variable-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument, but do affect our earnings and cash flow. We do not have the obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity, and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on our fixed-rate debt until we are required or elect to refinance it.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under each of our $650.0 million Term Loan Facility and our $1.905 billion Revolving Credit Facility. On March 5, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) confirmed it would cease publication of Overnight, 1, 3, 6 and 12 month US Dollar LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for US Dollar LIBOR. We expect a substantial portion of our indebtedness will eventually transition to bearing interest based on SOFR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect the anticipated discontinuance of LIBOR, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as SOFR, will have on us or our borrowing costs. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and its composition and characteristics are not the same as LIBOR. Given SOFRs very limited history and potential volatility as compared to other benchmark or market rates, the future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on historical performance. The consequences of using SOFR could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. We are monitoring these transition efforts and, although each of our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility contain provisions designed to accommodate an alternate reference rate, we may need to amend these and other contracts, such as interest rate hedges that reference these contracts, to accommodate any replacement rate. The potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe following table shows our debt obligations by scheduled maturity, weighted-average interest rates, and estimated fair value as of October 31, 2022 ($ amounts in thousands):\nFixed-rate debt Variable-rate debt (a)\nFiscal year of maturity Amount Weighted-\naverage\ninterest rate (%) Amount Weighted-\naverage\ninterest rate (%)\n2023 $ 604,527 4.15% $ 150,623 5.35%\n2024 130,214 4.56%\n2025 88,488 5.11%\n2026 376,111 4.86% 101,563 4.81%\n2027 460,442 4.83% 548,437 4.81%\nThereafter (b)\n875,500 4.02%\nBond discounts, premiums, and deferred issuance costs - net (4,729) (1,768)\nTotal $ 2,530,553 4.39% $ 798,855 4.91%\nFair value at October 31, 2022 $ 2,351,388 $ 800,623\n(a)Based upon the amount of variable-rate debt outstanding at October 31, 2022, and holding the variable-rate debt balance constant, each 1% increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately $8.0 million per year, without consideration of the Companys interest rate swap transactions.\n(b)In November 2020, we entered into five interest rate swap transactions to hedge $400.0 million of the Term Loan Facility through October 2025, which is included in the variable-rate debt column in the table above. The interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest cost on the $400.0 million at 0.369% plus the spread set forth in the pricing schedule in the Term Loan Facility, which was 1.05% as of October 31, 2022. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAny controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected; however, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report (Evaluation Date). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting on pages and, respectively, are incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are in the process of a complex implementation of a new ERP system that affects many of our financial processes. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes, as well as the underlying systems environment. The new ERP system will be a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. Other than the ERP system implementation noted above, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our quarter ended October 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. For a discussion of risks related to the implementation of our new ERP system, see Risk Factors - We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations.

Stowell\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2022.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we completed the acquisition of the operations of Rialto Homes, LP (Rialto). In accordance with SEC Staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, we have excluded Rialto from the Companys assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022. This acquisition represented less than 1% of the Companys total assets as of October 31, 2022 and less than 1% of the Companys revenues for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued its report, which is included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Toll Brothers, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Toll Brothers, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Toll Brothers, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the operations of Rialto Homes, LP, which are included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constitute less than 1% of total assets as of October 31, 2022 and less than 1% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the operations of Rialto Homes, LP.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated December 19, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nDecember 19, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Toll Brothers, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Toll Brothers, Inc. (the Company) as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated December 19, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccrual for Self-Insurance\nDescription of the Matter As described in Notes 1 and 7 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains general liability insurance, including construction defect and bodily injury coverage, and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of the risk of loss from claims related to home building activities, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. The Company accrues for expected costs associated with the self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits which constitute the accrual for self-insurance. The Companys accrual for self-insurance was $251.6 million as of October 31, 2022.\nThe Company records expenses and accrues liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover its self-insured liability under its insurance policies and the estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above coverage limits or that are not covered by insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of historical claims and industry data. The majority of the accrual for self-insurance is an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR).\nThe Company engages a third-party actuary that uses historical claim and expense data, input from the Companys internal legal and risk management groups, as well as industry data, to estimate the IBNR associated with the risks that the Company is assuming for its accrual for self-insurance, and other required costs to administer current and expected claims. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, the most significant being the long period of time between the delivery of a home to a home buyer and when a structural warranty or construction defect claim may be made, and the ultimate resolution of the claim.\nAuditing the Companys estimate of IBNR was especially challenging as evaluating the projection of losses related to these liabilities requires actuarial assumptions that are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding construction defect claims relative to markets and types of products the Company builds, insurance industry practices, and legal or regulatory actions and/or interpretations, among other factors. Key assumptions used in these estimates include claim frequencies, severity, and settlement patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. In addition, the estimate of IBNR is sensitive to significant assumptions including changes in the frequency and severity of reported claims and loss development factors for reported claims.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over managements review of the estimate of IBNR, including controls over the significant assumptions and the data inputs used in the actuarial analysis. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the actuarial analysis, including its review of the model and methodology, significant assumptions and the data inputs used in the analysis.\nTo test the estimate of IBNR we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the significant assumptions as well as the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company as inputs to develop the assumptions. We reviewed the Companys contractual self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. We also evaluated managements conclusions about the Companys legal and contractual obligations with respect to certain claims. We involved our internal actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the Companys estimate of IBNR, including evaluating the appropriateness of the model and methodology used by management, evaluating the reasonableness of the actuarial assumptions used by management and independently calculating an estimate of IBNR. We also evaluated the Companys disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.\nInventory Impairment\nDescription of the Matter As described in Notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company states its inventory at cost unless an impairment exists, in which case the inventory is written down to fair value. For the year ended October 31, 2022, the Company recorded inventory impairment charges of $19.7 million to operating communities and land owned for future communities. The Company regularly evaluates whether there are any impairment indicators for inventory present at the community level. If impairment indicators are present, the Company reviews the carrying value of each communitys inventory by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value. For inventory for which the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the Company writes down the carrying value of the inventory to its estimated fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow model.\nAuditing managements accounting for inventory impairment, its tests for recoverability and, when applicable, its measurement of impairment losses, was especially challenging and involved a high degree of subjectivity as a result of the assumptions and estimates inherent in these evaluations. In particular, managements assumptions and estimates included future home and/or land sales prices, the pace of future sales, and the applicable discount rates, which were sensitive to expectations about future demand, operations and economic factors. Additionally, the fair value of certain communities was highly sensitive to relatively small changes in one or more of those assumptions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over managements inventory impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the significant assumptions and data inputs utilized in the calculation of future undiscounted and discounted cash flows, if applicable.\nTo test the Companys estimated future cash flows used to test for the recoverability of a community and, if applicable, the measurement of an impairment loss, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its impairment analyses, evaluating the methodologies applied by management, and recalculating the total undiscounted and discounted cash flows, if applicable, in each analysis. In certain cases, we involved our internal real estate valuation specialists to assist in performing these procedures. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical sales data, sales trends, and observable market-specific data. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of inventory that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also evaluated the Companys disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1983.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nDecember 19, 2022\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in thousands)\nOctober 31,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,346,754 $ 1,638,494\nInventory 8,733,326 7,915,884\nProperty, construction, and office equipment - net 287,827 310,455\nReceivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets (1)\n747,228 738,078\nMortgage loans held for sale - at fair value 185,150 247,211\nCustomer deposits held in escrow 136,115 88,627\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities (1)\n852,314 599,101\n$ 12,288,714 $ 11,537,850\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nLiabilities\nLoans payable $ 1,185,275 $ 1,011,534\nSenior notes 1,995,271 2,403,989\nMortgage company loan facility 148,863 147,512\nCustomer deposits 680,588 636,379\nAccounts payable 619,411 562,466\nAccrued expenses 1,345,987 1,220,235\nIncome taxes payable 291,479 215,280\nTotal liabilities 6,266,874 6,197,395\nEquity\nStockholders equity\nPreferred stock, none issued - -\nCommon stock, 127,937 shares issued at October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021 1,279 1,279\nAdditional paid-in capital 716,786 714,453\nRetained earnings 6,166,732 4,969,839\nTreasury stock, at cost - 18,312 and 7,820 shares at October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively (916,327) (391,656)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") 37,618 1,109\nTotal stockholders equity 6,006,088 5,295,024\nNoncontrolling interest 15,752 45,431\nTotal equity 6,021,840 5,340,455\n$ 12,288,714 $ 11,537,850\n(1) As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets or investments in unconsolidated entities include $81.3 million and $90.8 million, respectively, of assets related to consolidated variable interest entities (\"VIEs\").

Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Toll Brothers, Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our), a Delaware corporation, and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in 50% or less owned partnerships and affiliates are accounted for using the equity method unless it is determined that we have effective control of the entity, in which case we would consolidate the entity.\nReferences herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. In times of economic disruption when uncertainty regarding future economic conditions is heightened, these estimates and assumptions are subject to greater variability. As a result, actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions we make that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, and such differences may be material.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nLiquid investments or investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our cash balances exceed federally insurable limits. We monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate; however, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists, in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). In addition to direct land acquisition costs, land development costs, and home construction costs, costs also include interest, real estate taxes, and direct overhead related to development and construction, which are capitalized to inventory during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction. For those communities that have been temporarily closed, no additional capitalized interest is allocated to a communitys inventory until it reopens. While the community remains closed, carrying costs such as real estate taxes are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalize certain interest costs to qualified inventory during the development and construction period of our communities in accordance with ASC 835-20, Capitalization of Interest (ASC 835-20). Capitalized interest is charged to home sales cost of sales revenues when the related inventory is delivered. Interest incurred on home building indebtedness in excess of qualified inventory, as defined in ASC 835-20, is charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the period incurred. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Companys qualified inventory exceeded its indebtedness and substantially all interest incurred was capitalized to inventory. See Note 3, Inventory.\nOnce a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open one of our typical communities, it may take four or more years to fully develop, sell, and deliver all the homes in such community. Longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community. Our master-planned communities, consisting of several smaller communities, may take up to 10 years or more to complete. Because our inventory is considered a long-lived asset under GAAP, we are required, under ASC 360, to regularly review the carrying value of each community and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable.\nOperating Communities: When the profitability of an operating community deteriorates, the sales pace declines significantly, or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset, the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the communitys carrying value, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community. The impairment is charged to home sales cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined. In estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community, we use various estimates such as (i) the expected sales pace in a community, based upon general economic conditions that will have a short-term or long-term impact on the market in which the community\nis located and on competition within the market, including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders; (ii) the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community; (iii) costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future, including, but not limited to, land and land development, home construction, interest, and overhead costs; (iv) alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace, sales price, building cost, or the number of homes that can be built on a particular site; and (v) alternative uses for the property such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites.\nFuture Communities: We evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities, whether owned or under contract, to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated. This evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above, as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment applicable to the land and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals, the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain the approvals, and the possible concessions that may be required to be given in order to obtain them. Concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets, dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space, or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built. Based upon this review, we decide (i) as to land under contract to be purchased, whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated, and (ii) as to land owned, whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner, or should be sold. We then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off. The write-off is charged to home sales cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined.\nThe estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions. Should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe are required to consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) in which we have a controlling financial interest in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation (ASC 810). A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOur variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of equity ownership, contracts to purchase assets, management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, loans provided by us to a VIE or other member, and/or guarantees provided by members to banks and other parties.\nWe have a significant number of land purchase contracts and financial interests in other entities which we evaluate in accordance with ASC 810. We analyze our land purchase contracts and the entities in which we have an investment to determine whether the land sellers and entities are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary (PB). We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other member(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other member(s), and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. The determination whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary may require significant judgment.\nProperty, Construction, and Office Equipment\nProperty, construction, and office equipment are recorded at cost and are stated net of accumulated depreciation of $289.4 million and $266.3 million at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For property and equipment related to onsite sales centers, depreciation is recorded using the units of production method as homes are delivered. For all other property and equipment, depreciation is recorded using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. In fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized $75.9 million, $74.8 million, and $67.6 million of depreciation expense, respectively.\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale are measured at fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825). We believe the use of ASC 825 improves consistency of mortgage loan valuations between the date the borrower locks in the interest rate on the pending mortgage loan and the date of the mortgage loan sale. At the end of the reporting period, we determine the fair value of our mortgage loans held for sale and the forward loan commitments we have entered into as a hedge against the interest rate risk of our mortgage loans using the market approach to determine fair value. The evaluation is based on the current market pricing of mortgage loans with similar terms and values as of the reporting date, and such pricing is applied to the mortgage loan portfolio. We recognize the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans held for sale as a gain or loss. In addition, we recognize the change in fair value of our forward loan commitments as a gain or loss. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is calculated based upon the stated interest rate of each loan. In addition, the recognition of net origination costs and fees associated with residential mortgage loans originated are expensed as incurred. These gains and losses, interest income, and origination costs and fees are recognized in Other income - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nIn accordance with ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, we review each of our investments on a quarterly basis for indicators of impairment. A series of operating losses of an investee, the inability to recover our invested capital, or other factors may indicate that a loss in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred. If a loss exists, we further review the investment to determine if the loss is other than temporary, in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates, including, but not limited to, expected sales pace, expected sales prices, expected incentives, costs incurred and anticipated, sufficiency of financing and capital, competition, market conditions, and anticipated cash receipts, in order to determine projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entity. In addition, for investments in rental properties, we review rental trends, expected future expenses, and expected cash flows to determine estimated fair values of the properties.\nOur unconsolidated entities that develop land or develop for-sale homes and condominiums evaluate their inventory in a similar manner as we do. See Inventory above for more detailed disclosure on our evaluation of inventory. For our unconsolidated entities that own, develop, and manage for-rent residential apartments, we review rental trends, expected future expenses, and expected future cash flows to determine estimated fair values of the underlying properties. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in income from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities.\nWe are a party to several joint ventures with unrelated parties to develop and sell land that is owned by the joint ventures. We recognize our proportionate share of the earnings from the sale of home sites to other builders, including our joint venture partners. We do not recognize earnings from the home sites we purchase from these ventures at the time of purchase; instead, our cost basis in those home sites is reduced by our share of the earnings realized by the joint venture from sales of those home sites to us.\nWe are also a party to several other joint ventures. We recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of our unconsolidated entities.\nFair Value Disclosures\nWe use ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), to measure the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements.\nThe fair value hierarchy is summarized below:\nLevel 1: Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, generally either quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar techniques.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nOur objective in entering into derivative transactions is to manage our exposure to interest rate movements associated with certain variable rate debt, mortgage loans held for sale and forward loan commitments we have entered into related to our mortgage operations. We recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.\nWe have entered into interest rate swaps related to a portion of our variable rate debt. These derivative transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The entire change in the fair value of these derivative transactions included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to home sales cost of revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, the amount recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is released to earnings.\nOur derivative transactions related to our mortgage loans held for sale and our forward loan commitments are not designated as hedges and therefore the entire change in the fair value of these derivative transactions is included as a gain or loss in Other income - net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nSee Note 12 Fair Value Disclosures for more information.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost. Issuance of treasury stock is accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis. Differences between the cost of treasury stock and the re-issuance proceeds are charged to additional paid-in capital. When treasury stock is cancelled, any excess purchase price over par value is charged directly to retained earnings. In fiscal 2021, we cancelled 25 million shares of treasury stock.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition\nHome sales revenues: Revenues and cost of revenues from home sales are recognized at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer. For the majority of our home closings, our performance obligation to deliver a home is satisfied in less than one year from the date a binding sale agreement is signed. In certain states where we build, we are not able to complete certain outdoor features prior to the closing of the home. To the extent these separate performance obligations are not complete upon the home closing, we defer the portion of the home sales revenues related to these obligations and subsequently recognize the revenue upon completion of such obligations. As of October 31, 2022, the home sales revenues and related costs we deferred related to these obligations were immaterial. Our contract liabilities, consisting of deposits received from customers for sold but undelivered homes, totaled $680.6 million and $636.4 million at October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. Of the outstanding customer deposits held as of October 31, 2021, we recognized $515.6 million in home sales revenues during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022. Of the outstanding customer deposits held as of October 31, 2020, we recognized $382.1 million in home sales revenues during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.\nFor our standard attached and detached homes, land, land development, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated land, land development, and related costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community. Home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method. The estimated land, common area development, and related costs of master-planned communities, including the cost of golf courses, net of their estimated residual value, are allocated to individual communities within a master-planned community on a relative sales value basis. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master-planned community.\nFor high-rise/mid-rise projects, land, land development, construction, and related costs, both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future, are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value. Any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered.\nLand sales and other revenues: Our revenues from land sales and other generally consist of: (1) land sales to joint ventures in which we retain an interest; (2) lot sales to third-party builders within our master-planned communities; (2) land sales to joint ventures in which we retain an interest; (3) bulk land sales to third parties of land we have decided no longer meets our development criteria; and (4) sales of commercial and retail properties generally located at our City Living projects. In general,\nour performance obligation for each of these land sales is fulfilled upon the delivery of the land, which generally coincides with the receipt of cash consideration from the counterparty. For land sale transactions that contain repurchase options, revenues and related costs are not recognized until the repurchase option expires. In addition, when we sell land to a joint venture in which we retain an interest, we do not recognize revenue or gains on the sale to the extent of our retained interest in such joint venture.\nForfeited Customer Deposits: Forfeited customer deposits are recognized in Home sales revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit.\nSales Incentives: In order to promote sales of our homes, we may offer our home buyers sales incentives. These incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. Incentives are reflected as a reduction in home sales revenues. Incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs, including brochures and signage, were $42.5 million, $39.1 million, and $46.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWarranty and Self-Insurance\nWarranty: We provide all of our home buyers with a limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. We also provide many of our home buyers with a limited 10-year warranty as to structural integrity. We accrue for expected warranty costs at the time each home is closed and title and possession are transferred to the home buyer. Warranty costs are accrued based upon historical experience. Adjustments to our warranty liabilities related to homes delivered in prior periods are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs. Over the past several years, we have had a significant number of warranty claims related primarily to homes built in Pennsylvania and Delaware. See Note 7 - Accrued Expenses for additional information regarding these warranty charges.\nSelf-Insurance: We maintain, and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our home building activities, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits (self-insured liability). We also provide general liability insurance for our subcontractors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, and certain areas of Texas, where eligible subcontractors are enrolled as insureds under our general liability insurance policies in each community in which they perform work. For those enrolled subcontractors, we absorb their general liability associated with the work performed on our homes within the applicable community as part of our overall general liability insurance and our self-insured liability.\nWe record expenses and liabilities based on the estimated costs required to cover our self-insured liability and the estimated costs of potential claims and claim adjustment expenses that are above our coverage limits or that are not covered by our insurance policies. These estimated costs are based on an analysis of our historical claims and industry data, and include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR).\nWe engage a third-party actuary that uses our historical claim and expense data, input from our internal legal and risk management groups, as well as industry data, to estimate our liabilities related to unpaid claims, IBNR associated with the risks that we are assuming for our self-insured liability, and other required costs to administer current and expected claims. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, the most significant being the long period of time between the delivery of a home to a home buyer and when a structural warranty or construction defect claim may be made, and the ultimate resolution of the claim. Though state regulations vary, construction defect claims may be reported and resolved over a prolonged period of time, which can extend for 10 years or longer. As a result, the majority of the estimated liability relates to IBNR. Adjustments to our liabilities related to homes delivered in prior years are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs.\nThe projection of losses related to these liabilities requires actuarial assumptions that are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of product we build, insurance industry practices, and legal or regulatory actions and/or interpretations, among other factors. Key assumptions used in these estimates include claim frequencies, severity, and settlement patterns, which can occur over an extended period of time. In addition, changes in the frequency and severity of reported claims and the estimates to settle claims can impact the trends and assumptions used in the actuarial analysis, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Due to the degree of judgment required, and the potential for variability in these underlying assumptions, our actual future costs could differ from those estimated, and the difference could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718). We use a lattice model for the valuation of our stock option grants. The option pricing models used are designed to estimate the value of options that, unlike employee stock options and restricted stock units, can be traded at any time and are transferable. In addition to restrictions on trading, employee stock options and restricted stock units may include other restrictions such as vesting periods. Further, such models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the stock price. Stock-based compensation expense is generally included in Selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. We recognize forfeitures of stock-based awards as a reduction to compensation expense in the period in which they occur.\nLegal Expenses\nTransactional legal expenses for land acquisition and entitlement, and financing are capitalized and expensed over their appropriate life. We expense legal fees related to litigation, warranty and insurance claims when incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance must be established when, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Income Taxes - Valuation Allowance below.\nFederal and state income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax law and also include, in the applicable period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized for financial reporting purposes in different periods than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable, we believe that our positions may be challenged and disallowed by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provisions and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable disallowances as deemed appropriate. To the extent that the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimates will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. ASC 740 requires a company to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a substantiated likelihood of more than 50%), based on the technical merits of the position, that the position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Our inability to determine that a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold does not mean that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or any other taxing authority will disagree with the position that we have taken.\nIf a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, despite our belief that our filing position is supportable, the benefit of that tax position is not recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and we are required to accrue potential interest and penalties until the uncertainty is resolved. Potential interest and penalties are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes. Differences between amounts taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are considered unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that we have a reasonable basis for each of our filing positions and intend to defend those positions if challenged by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction. If the IRS or other taxing authorities do not disagree with our position, and after the statute of limitations expires, we will recognize the unrecognized tax benefit in the period that the uncertainty of the tax position is eliminated.\nIncome Taxes - Valuation Allowance\nWe assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in each period based on whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset would not be realized. If, based on the available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that such asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset. The realization of a\ndeferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, consistency, and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses; forecasts of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods; our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration; tax planning alternatives: and outlooks for the U.S. housing industry and broader economy. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could also affect our actual tax results. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods, actual results could differ from the estimates used in our assessment that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate in the following five geographic segments, with current operations generally located in the states listed below:\nEastern Region:\nThe North region: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania;\nThe Mid-Atlantic region: Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia;\nThe South region: Florida, South Carolina and Texas;\nWestern Region:\nThe Mountain region: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada and Utah; and\nThe Pacific region: California, Oregon and Washington.\nOur geographic reporting segments are consistent with how our chief operating decision makers are assessing operating performance and allocating capital.\nAt October 31, 2022, we concluded that our City Living operations were no longer a reportable operating segment, primarily due to its insignificance as a result of the change in structure and shift in strategy for its operations. Therefore, we have five operating segments as reflected above. Amounts reported in prior periods have been restated to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation. The realignment did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, earnings per share or cash flows for the periods presented.\nAs the result of recent acquisitions, we commenced operations in San Antonio, Texas in fiscal 2022 and Tennessee in fiscal 2020.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 became effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2020, and we adopted the standard under the modified retrospective transition method. As a result of the adoption, we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, of $0.6 million to the opening balance of retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures, and there have been no significant changes to our internal controls, processes, or systems as a result of implementing this new standard.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), as amended by ASU 2021-01 in January 2021, directly addressing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting as a result of the cessation of the publication of certain LIBOR rates beginning December 31, 2021, with complete elimination of the publication of the LIBOR rates by June 30, 2023. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform by virtue of referencing LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. This guidance became effective on March 12, 2020 and can be adopted no later than December 31, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, but do not expect that the adoption of ASU 2020-04, as amended by ASU 2021-01, will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.\n2. Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a privately-held home builder with operations in San Antonio, Texas for approximately $48.1 million in cash. The assets acquired, which consisted of 16 communities, were primarily inventory, including approximately 450 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition and was not material to our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn fiscal 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of a privately-held home builder with operations in Las Vegas, Nevada for approximately $38.8 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory for future communities, including approximately 550 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. This acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition and was not material to our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn fiscal 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of an urban infill builder with operations in Atlanta, Georgia and Nashville, Tennessee, and a builder with operations in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $79.2 million in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory, including approximately 1,100 home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. One of these acquisitions was accounted for as a business combination and neither were material to our results of operations or financial condition.\n3. Inventory\nInventory at October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nLand controlled for future communities $ 240,751 $ 185,656\nLand owned for future communities 808,851 564,737\nOperating communities 7,683,724 7,165,491\n$ 8,733,326 $ 7,915,884\nOperating communities include communities offering homes for sale; communities that have sold all available home sites but have not completed delivery of the homes; communities that were previously offering homes for sale but are temporarily closed due to business conditions or non-availability of improved home sites and that are expected to reopen within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year being reported on; and communities preparing to open for sale. The carrying value attributable to operating communities includes the cost of homes under construction, land and land development costs, the carrying cost of home sites in current and future phases of these communities, and the carrying cost of model homes.\nCommunities that were previously offering homes for sale but are temporarily closed due to business conditions, do not have any remaining backlog, and are not expected to reopen within 12 months of the end of the fiscal period being reported on are included in land owned for future communities. Backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers (backlog).\nThe amounts we have provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, are shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nCharge: 2022 2021 2020\nLand controlled for future communities $ 13,051 $ 5,620 $ 23,539\nLand owned for future communities 19,690 19,805 31,669\nOperating communities - 1,110 675\n$ 32,741 $ 26,535 $ 55,883\nSee Note 12, Fair Value Disclosures, for information regarding (1) the number of operating communities that we tested for potential impairment, the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges, the amount of impairment charges recognized, and the fair value of those communities, net of impairment charges. and (2) the number of future communities impaired, the amount of impairment charges recognized, and the fair value of those communities, net of impairment charges.\nSee Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, for information regarding land purchase contracts.\nAt October 31, 2022, we evaluated our land purchase contracts, including those to acquire land for apartment developments, to determine whether any of the selling entities were VIEs and, if they were, whether we were the primary beneficiary of any of them. Under these land purchase contracts, we do not possess legal title to the land; our maximum exposure to loss is generally\nlimited to deposits paid to the sellers and predevelopment costs incurred; and the creditors of the sellers generally have no recourse against us. At October 31, 2022, we determined that 237 land purchase contracts, with an aggregate purchase price of $3.89 billion, on which we had made aggregate deposits totaling $417.6 million, were VIEs, but that we were not the primary beneficiary of any VIE related to such land purchase contracts. At October 31, 2021, we determined that 289 land purchase contracts, with an aggregate purchase price of $3.67 billion, on which we had made aggregate deposits totaling $302.4 million, were VIEs, but that we were not the primary beneficiary of any VIE related to such land purchase contracts.\nInterest incurred, capitalized, and expensed in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was as follows (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nInterest capitalized, beginning of year $ 253,938 $ 297,975 $ 311,323\nInterest incurred 135,029 152,986 172,530\nInterest expensed to home sales cost of revenues (164,831) (187,237) (174,375)\nInterest expensed to land sales and other cost of revenues (5,788) (4,372) (5,443)\nInterest expensed in other income - net - - (2,440)\nInterest reclassified to property, construction and office equipment - net - (1,034) -\nInterest capitalized on investments in unconsolidated entities (6,699) (4,574) (3,835)\nPreviously capitalized interest transferred to investments in unconsolidated entities (2,412) - -\nPreviously capitalized interest on investments in unconsolidated entities transferred to inventory 231 194 215\nInterest capitalized, end of year $ 209,468 $ 253,938 $ 297,975\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $(2.9) million and $0.9 million of net (gains) losses related to our interest rate swaps which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively, and approximately $(31,300) and $211,000 of net (gains) losses were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to home sales cost of revenues, respectively. No similar amounts were incurred during the year ended October 31, 2020.\n4. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe have investments in various unconsolidated entities and our ownership interest in these investments range from 5.0% to 50%. These entities, which are structured as joint ventures either (i) develop land for the joint venture participants and for sale to outside builders (Land Development Joint Ventures); (ii) develop for-sale homes (Home Building Joint Ventures); (iii) develop luxury for-rent residential apartments and single family homes, commercial space, and a hotel (Rental Property Joint Ventures), or (iv) provide financing and land banking to residential builders and developers for the acquisition and development of land and home sites (Gibraltar Joint Ventures). In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized income from the unconsolidated entities in which we had an investment of $23.7 million, $74.0 million, and $0.9 million, respectively.\nThe table below provides information as of October 31, 2022, regarding active joint ventures that we are invested in, by joint venture category ($ amounts in thousands):\nLand\nDevelopment\nJoint Ventures Home Building\nJoint Ventures Rental Property\nJoint Ventures Gibraltar\nJoint Ventures Total\nNumber of unconsolidated entities\n15 3 41 4 63\nInvestment in unconsolidated entities (1)\n$ 343,314 $ 49,385 $ 441,399 $ 18,216 $ 852,314\nNumber of unconsolidated entities with funding commitments by the Company\n9 1 18 1 29\nCompanys remaining funding commitment to unconsolidated entities (2)\n$ 180,812 $ 20,072 $ 90,900 $ 12,533 $ 304,317\n(1) Our total investment includes $100.2 million related to 13 unconsolidated joint venture-related variable interests in VIEs and our maximum exposure to losses related to these VIEs is approximately $200.0 million as of October 31, 2022.

Prior to the formation of these ventures, we capitalized approximately $106.5 million of land and land development costs. Our partner acquired a 55% interest in these ventures for approximately $61.0 million, which equaled our pro-rata cost basis. We received cash of $61.2 million as a result of these formations, which included a combination of partner and loan proceeds, resulting in our initial investment in these ventures of $45.5 million. Concurrent with their formation, the joint ventures entered into construction loan agreements aggregating $219.7 million to finance the remaining development of these projects, of which $17.6 million was borrowed at the closing of the ventures.\nThe table below provides information on joint ventures entered into during fiscal 2021 ($ amounts in thousands):\nLand Development Joint Ventures Rental Property Joint Ventures\nNumber of unconsolidated joint ventures entered into during the period 6 11\nInvestment balance at October 31, 2021\n$ 112,400 $ 112,900\nResults of Operations and Intra-entity Transactions\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, certain of our Rental Property Joint Ventures sold their underlying assets to unrelated parties or to our joint venture partner. In connection with these sales, we recognized gains of $21.0 million, $74.8 million, and $10.7 million, respectively, which is included in Income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges on our investments in certain Home Building and Rental Property Joint Ventures of $8.0 million and $2.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we purchased land from unconsolidated entities, principally related to our acquisition of lots from our Land Development Joint Ventures, totaling $54.8 million, $18.5 million, and $17.6 million, respectively. Our share of income from the lots we acquired was insignificant in each period. We sold land to unconsolidated entities, which principally involved land sales to our Home Building and Rental Property Joint Ventures, totaling $434.2 million, $227.8 million and $74.1 million in our fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. These amounts are included in Land sales and other revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are generally sold at or near our land basis.\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had receivables due from joint ventures totaling $51.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, primarily related to amounts we funded on behalf of our partners that had not yet been reimbursed and amounts due to us for management fees earned.\nGuarantees\nThe unconsolidated entities in which we have investments generally finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, we have guaranteed portions of debt of unconsolidated entities. These guarantees may include any or all of the following: (i) project completion guarantees, including any cost overruns; (ii) repayment guarantees, generally covering a percentage of the outstanding loan; (iii) carry cost guarantees, which cover costs such as interest, real estate taxes, and insurance; (iv) an environmental indemnity provided to the lender that holds the lender harmless from and against losses arising from the discharge of hazardous materials from the property and non-compliance with applicable environmental laws; and (v) indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity.\nIn some instances, we and our joint venture partner have provided joint and several guarantees in connection with loans to unconsolidated entities. In these situations, we generally seek to implement a reimbursement agreement with our partner that provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share or agreed upon share of the guarantee; however, we are not always successful. In addition, if the joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under such a reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share.\nWe believe that, as of October 31, 2022, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of an obligation of an unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event, the collateral in such entity should be sufficient to repay a significant portion of the obligation. If it is not, we and our partners would need to contribute additional capital to the venture.\nInformation with respect to certain of the Companys unconsolidated entities outstanding debt obligations, loan commitments and our guarantees thereon are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\nOctober 31, 2022 October 31, 2021\nLoan commitments in the aggregate $ 2,858,800 $ 2,195,200\nOur maximum estimated exposure under repayment and carry cost guarantees if the full amount of the debt obligations were borrowed (1)\n$ 597,800 $ 418,800\nDebt obligations borrowed in the aggregate $ 1,110,900 $ 1,092,700\nOur maximum estimated exposure under repayment and carry cost guarantees of the debt obligations borrowed $ 390,500 $ 222,000\nEstimated fair value of guarantees provided by us related to debt and other obligations $ 16,900 $ 11,000\nTerms of guarantees 1 month -\n3.7 years 4 months -\n4.0 years\n(1) At October 31, 2022 and 2021, our maximum estimated exposure under repayment and carry cost guarantees includes approximately $95.0 million and $106.1 million, respectively, related to our unconsolidated Joint Venture VIEs.\nThe maximum exposure estimates presented above do not take into account any recoveries from the underlying collateral or any reimbursement from our partners. Nor do they include any potential exposures related to project completion guarantees or the indemnities noted above, which are not estimable. We have not made payments under any of the outstanding guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe have both unconsolidated and consolidated joint venture-related variable interests in VIEs. Information regarding our involvement in unconsolidated joint-venture related variable interests in VIEs has been disclosed throughout information presented above.\nThe table below provides information as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, regarding our consolidated joint venture-related variable interests in VIEs ($ amounts in thousands):\nBalance Sheet Classification October 31, 2022 October 31, 2021\nNumber of Joint Venture VIEs that the Company is the PB and consolidates\n5 5\nCarrying value of consolidated VIEs assets Receivables prepaid expenses, and other assets and Investments in unconsolidated entities $ 81,300 $ 90,800\nOur partners interests in consolidated VIEs Noncontrolling interest $ 9,700 $ 39,400\nOur ownership interest in the above consolidated Joint Venture VIEs ranges from 82% to 98%.\nAs shown above, we have concluded we are the PB of certain VIEs due to our controlling financial interest in such ventures as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint ventures performance and the obligation to absorb expected losses or receive benefits from the joint ventures. The assets of these VIEs can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIEs. In addition, in certain of the joint ventures, in the event additional contributions are required to be funded to the joint ventures prior to the admission of any additional investor at a future date, we will fund 100% of such contributions, including our partners pro rata share, which we expect would be funded through an interest-bearing loan. For other VIEs, we have concluded that we are not the PB because the power to direct the activities of such VIEs that most significantly impact their performance was either shared by us and such VIEs other partners or such activities were controlled by our partner. For VIEs where the power to direct significant activities is shared, business plans, budgets, and other major decisions are required to be unanimously approved by all members. Management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market rates, and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other members.\nJoint Venture Condensed Combined Financial Information\nThe Condensed Combined Balance Sheets, as of the dates indicated, and the Condensed Combined Statements of Operations, for the periods indicated, for the unconsolidated entities in which we have an investment, aggregated by type of business, are included below (in thousands).\nCondensed Combined Balance Sheets:\nOctober 31, 2022\nLand Develop-\nment Joint\nVentures Home\nBuilding\nJoint\nVentures\nRental Property Joint Ventures Gibraltar\nJoint\nVentures Total\nCash and cash equivalents $ 132,344 $ 19,628 $ 102,270 $ 642 $ 254,884\nInventory 1,047,437 168,743 - 40,035 1,256,215\nLoan receivables, net - - - 48,217 48,217\nRental properties - - 1,702,690 - 1,702,690\nRental properties under development - - 1,413,607 - 1,413,607\nOther assets 172,110 15,232 117,027 881 305,250\nTotal assets $ 1,351,891 $ 203,603 $ 3,335,594 $ 89,775 $ 4,980,863\nDebt, net of deferred financing costs $ 443,061 $ 16,770 $ 1,788,923 $ - $ 2,248,754\nOther liabilities 100,931 52,116 225,812 20,959 399,818\nMembers equity 807,899 134,717 1,320,859 68,816 2,332,291\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 1,351,891 $ 203,603 $ 3,335,594 $ 89,775 $ 4,980,863\nCompanys net investment in unconsolidated entities (1)\n$ 343,314 $ 49,385 $ 441,399 $ 18,216 $ 852,314\nOctober 31, 2021\nLand Develop-\nment Joint\nVentures Home\nBuilding\nJoint\nVentures\nRental Property Joint Ventures Gibraltar\nJoint\nVentures Total\nCash and cash equivalents $ 39,191 $ 28,137 $ 85,499 $ 755 $ 153,582\nInventory 820,916 98,981 - 45,065 964,962\nLoan receivables, net - - - 86,727 86,727\nRental properties - - 1,496,355 - 1,496,355\nRental properties under development - - 697,659 - 697,659\nOther assets 144,320 10,157 71,917 1,185 227,579\nTotal assets $ 1,004,427 $ 137,275 $ 2,351,430 $ 133,732 $ 3,626,864\nDebt, net of deferred financing costs $ 325,973 $ - $ 1,351,646 $ - $ 1,677,619\nOther liabilities 65,033 11,725 153,338 18,449 248,545\nMembers equity 613,421 125,550 846,446 115,283 1,700,700\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 1,004,427 $ 137,275 $ 2,351,430 $ 133,732 $ 3,626,864\nCompanys net investment in unconsolidated entities (1)\n$ 243,767 $ 12,944 $ 316,580 $ 25,810 $ 599,101\n(1) Our underlying equity in the net assets of the unconsolidated entities was (less)/more than our net investment in unconsolidated entities by $(18.5) million and $16.5 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and these differences are primarily a result of other than temporary impairments related to our investments in unconsolidated entities;

See Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for additional information regarding VIEs.\n6. Loans Payable, Senior Notes, and Mortgage Company Loan Facility\nLoans Payable\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, loans payable consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nSenior unsecured term loan $ 650,000 $ 650,000\nLoans payable - other 537,043 364,042\nDeferred issuance costs (1,768) (2,508)\n$ 1,185,275 $ 1,011,534\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan\nWe are party to a five-year $650.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) with a syndicate of banks, most of which is scheduled to expire on November 1, 2026. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we voluntarily repaid $150.0 million of the then $800.0 million in principal amount that was outstanding. No prepayment charges were incurred in connection with the repayment. On October 31, 2021, we entered into term loan extension agreements to extend the maturity date of $548.4 million of outstanding term loans from November 1, 2025 to November 1, 2026, with the remainder of the term loans remaining due November 1, 2025. The Term Loan Facility provides an accordion feature under which we may, subject to certain conditions set forth in the agreement, increase the Term Loan Facility up to a maximum aggregate amount of $1.5 billion. Other than $101.6 million of term loans that are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2025, there are no payments required before the final maturity date on the Term Loan Facility.\nUnder the Term Loan Facility, as amended, we may select interest rates equal to (i) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, (ii) the base rate (as defined in the agreement) plus an applicable margin, or (iii) the federal funds/Euro rate (as defined in the agreement) plus an applicable margin, in each case, based on our leverage ratio. At October 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 4.81% per annum.\nWe and substantially all of our 100%-owned home building subsidiaries are guarantors under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility contains substantially the same financial covenants as the Revolving Credit Facility, as described below.\nIn November 2020, we entered into five interest rate swap transactions to hedge $400.0 million of the Term Loan Facility through October 2025. The interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest cost on the $400.0 million at 0.369% plus the spread set forth in the pricing schedule in the Term Loan Facility, which was 1.05% as of October 31, 2022. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe are party to a $1.905 billion senior unsecured, five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of banks, substantially all of which is scheduled to expire on November 1, 2026. On October 31, 2021, we entered into extension letter agreements (the Revolver Extension Agreements) to extend the maturity date of $1.78 billion of the revolving loans and commitments from November 1, 2025 to November 1, 2026, with the remainder of the revolving loans and commitments continuing to terminate on November 1, 2025.\nUnder the Revolving Credit Facility, up to 100% of the commitment is available for letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility has an accordion feature under which we may, subject to certain conditions set forth in the agreement, increase the Revolving Credit Facility up to a maximum aggregate amount of $2.50 billion. We may select interest rates for the Revolving Credit Facility equal to (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) the lenders base rate plus an applicable margin, which in each case is based on our credit rating and leverage ratio. At October 31, 2022, the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would have been 4.95% per annum. We are obligated to pay an undrawn commitment fee that is based on the average daily unused amount of the Aggregate Credit Commitment and our credit ratings and leverage ratio. Any proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. We and substantially all of our 100%-owned home building subsidiaries are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nUnder the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, at October 31, 2022, our maximum leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) may not exceed 1.75 to 1.00, and we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than approximately $2.23 billion. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, at October 31, 2022, our leverage ratio was approximately 0.30 to 1.00 and our tangible net worth was approximately $5.96 billion. Based upon the limitations related to our repurchase of common stock in the Revolving Credit Facility, our ability to repurchase our common stock was limited to approximately $4.47 billion as of October 31, 2022. In addition, under the provisions of the Revolving Credit Facility, our ability to pay cash dividends was limited to approximately $3.72 billion as of October 31, 2022.\nAt October 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of $117.7 million.\nLoans Payable - Other\nLoans payable - other primarily represent purchase money mortgages on properties we acquired that the seller had financed, project-level financing, and various revenue bonds that were issued by government entities on our behalf to finance community infrastructure and our manufacturing facilities. Information regarding our loans payable at October 31, 2022 and 2021, is included in the table below ($ amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nAggregate loans payable at October 31 $ 537,043 $ 364,042\nWeighted-average interest rate 4.14 % 4.33 %\nInterest rate range 0.19% - 7.00% 0.14% - 10.0%\nLoans secured by assets:\nCarrying value of loans secured by assets $ 537,043 $ 364,042\nCarrying value of assets securing loans $ 1,327,683 $ 1,067,728\nThe contractual maturities of Loans payable - other as of October 31, 2022, ranged from one month to 29.5 years.\nSenior Notes\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, senior notes consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\n5.875% Senior Notes due February 15, 2022 $ - $ 409,856\n4.375% Senior Notes due April 15, 2023 400,000 400,000\n4.875% Senior Notes due November 15, 2025 350,000 350,000\n4.875% Senior Notes due March 15, 2027 450,000 450,000\n4.35% Senior Notes due February 15, 2028 400,000 400,000\n3.80% Senior Notes due November 1, 2029 400,000 400,000\nBond discounts, premiums, and deferred issuance costs - net (4,729) (5,867)\n$ 1,995,271 $ 2,403,989\nThe senior notes are the unsecured obligations of Toll Brothers Finance Corp., our 100%-owned subsidiary. The payment of principal and interest is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by us and substantially all of our 100%-owned home building subsidiaries (together with Toll Brothers Finance Corp., the Senior Note Parties). The senior notes rank equally in right of payment with all the Senior Note Parties existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The senior notes are structurally subordinated to the prior claims of creditors, including trade creditors, of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the senior notes. Each series of senior notes is redeemable in whole or in part at any time at our option, at prices that vary based upon the then-current rates of interest and the remaining original term of the senior notes to be redeemed.\nIn November 2021, we redeemed the remaining $409.9 million principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due February 15, 2022, at par, plus accrued interest.\nIn March 2021, we redeemed, prior to maturity, all $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding 5.625% Senior Notes due 2024. In connection with this redemption, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $34.2 million, inclusive of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, which is recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we redeemed, prior to maturity, approximately $10.0 million of the $409.9 million then-outstanding principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due February 15, 2022, plus accrued interest.\nMortgage Company Loan Facility\nToll Brothers Mortgage Company (TBMC), our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, has a mortgage warehousing agreement (Warehousing Agreement) with a bank, which has been amended from time to time, to finance the origination of mortgage loans by TBMC. The Warehousing Agreement is accounted for as a secured borrowing under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing. The Warehousing Agreement provides for loan purchases up to $75.0 million, subject to certain sublimits. In addition, the Warehousing Agreement, provides for an accordion feature under which TBMC may request that the aggregate commitments under the Warehousing Agreement be increased to an amount up to $150.0 million for a short period of time. We are also subject to an under usage fee based on outstanding balances, as defined in the Warehousing Agreement. Before the amendment and restatement in April 2022, the Warehousing Agreement was set to expire on April 2, 2022, and borrowings thereunder bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum. In April 2022, the Warehousing Agreement was amended and restated to extend the expiration date to March 31, 2023 and to cause borrowings thereunder to bear interest at the Bloomberg Short-Term Yield Index Rate (BSBY) plus 1.75% per annum (with a BSBY floor of 0.50%). At October 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Warehousing Agreement was 5.38% per annum. Borrowings under this facility are included in the fiscal 2023 maturities in the table below.\nAt each of October 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $148.9 million and $147.5 million, respectively, outstanding under the Warehousing Agreement, which are included in liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At October 31, 2022 and 2021, amounts outstanding under the agreement were collateralized by $187.2 million and $245.0 million, respectively, of mortgage loans held for sale, which are included in assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 31, 2022, there were no aggregate outstanding purchase price limitations reducing the amount available to TBMC. There are several restrictions on purchased loans under the agreement, including that they cannot be sold to others, they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent, and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreements.\nGeneral\nAs of October 31, 2022, the annual aggregate maturities of our loans and notes during each of the next five fiscal years are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nAmount\n2023 $ 755,150\n2024 $ 130,214\n2025 $ 88,488\n2026 $ 477,674\n2027 $ 1,008,879\n7. Accrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses at October 31, 2022 and 2021, consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nLand, land development and construction $ 334,975 $ 310,996\nCompensation and employee benefits 223,609 232,161\nEscrow liability 44,115 36,107\nSelf-insurance 251,576 236,369\nWarranty 164,409 145,062\nLease liabilities 139,664 116,248\nDeferred income 50,973 36,638\nInterest 31,988 34,033\nCommitments to unconsolidated entities 26,905 22,150\nOther 77,773 50,471\n$ 1,345,987 $ 1,220,235\nAt the time each home is closed and title and possession are transferred to the home buyer, we record an initial accrual for expected warranty costs on that home. Our initial accrual for expected warranty costs is based upon historical warranty claim experience. Adjustments to our warranty liabilities related to homes delivered in prior periods are recorded in the period in which a change in our estimate occurs. The table below provides a reconciliation of the changes in our warranty accrual during\nfiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance, beginning of year $ 145,062 $ 157,351 $ 201,886\nAdditions - homes closed during the year 42,423 42,316 36,103\nAddition - liabilities assumed 150 100 190\nIncrease in accruals for homes closed in prior years - net (1)\n39,433 9,155 6,711\nReclassification from self-insurance accruals - 3,618 -\nDecrease to water intrusion accrual - (11,823) (24,400)\nCharges incurred (62,659) (55,655) (63,139)\nBalance, end of year $ 164,409 $ 145,062 $ 157,351\n(1) The fiscal 2022 amount includes an additional $29.0 million of warranty charges expected to be recovered from our insurance carriers and suppliers, which are recorded as a receivable at October 31, 2022 and is included in Receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets on our 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSince fiscal 2014, we have received water intrusion claims from owners of homes built since 2002 in communities located in Pennsylvania and Delaware (which are in our North region). We continue to perform review procedures to assess, among other things, the number of affected homes, whether repairs are likely to be required, and the extent of such repairs.\nOur review process, conducted quarterly, includes an analysis of many factors to determine whether a claim is likely to be received and the estimated costs to resolve any such claim, including: the closing dates of the homes; the number of claims received; our inspection of homes; an estimate of the number of homes we expect to repair; the type and cost of repairs that have been performed in each community; the estimated costs to remediate pending and future claims; the expected recovery from our insurance carriers and suppliers; and the previously recorded amounts related to these claims. We also monitor legal developments relating to these types of claims and review the volume, relative merits and adjudication of claims in litigation or arbitration.\nFrom October 31, 2016 through the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our recorded aggregate estimated repair costs to be incurred for known and unknown water intrusion claims was $324.4 million and our recorded aggregate expected recoveries from insurance carriers and suppliers were approximately $152.6 million. Based on trends in claims experience over several years and lower than anticipated repair costs, in the second fiscal quarter of 2020 and again in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021, we reduced the aggregate estimated repair costs to be incurred for known and unknown water intrusion claims by a total of $36.2 million. Because these reductions were associated with periods in which we expect our insurance deductibles and self-insured retentions to be exhausted, we reduced our aggregate expected recoveries from insurance carriers and suppliers by a corresponding $36.2 million. Our recorded remaining estimated repair costs, which reflects a reduction for the aggregate amount expended to resolve claims, were approximately $46.9 million at October 31, 2022 and $54.7 million at October 31, 2021. Our recorded remaining expected recoveries from insurance carriers and suppliers were approximately $2.3 million at October 31, 2022 and $5.8 million at October 31, 2021.\nAs noted above, our review process includes a number of estimates that are based on assumptions with uncertain outcomes. Due to the degree of judgment required in making these estimates and the inherent uncertainty in potential outcomes, it is reasonably possible that our actual costs and recoveries could differ from those recorded and such differences could be material. In addition, due to such uncertainty, we are unable to estimate the range of any such differences.\n8. Income Taxes\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the federal statutory tax rate for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 ($ amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\n$ %* $ %* $ %*\nFederal tax provision at statutory rate 357,782 21.0 231,066 21.0 123,249 21.0\nState tax provision, net of federal benefit 75,465 4.4 50,153 4.6 25,793 4.4\nOther permanent differences 4,386 0.3 8,388 0.8 4,755 0.8\nReversal of accrual for uncertain tax positions (1,690) (0.1) (993) (0.1) (1,749) (0.3)\nAccrued interest on anticipated tax assessments\n234 - 297 - 404 0.1\nIncrease in unrecognized tax benefits 658 - - - - -\nExcess stock compensation benefit (3,012) (0.2) (4,698) (0.4) (3,339) (0.6)\nEnergy tax credits (22,153) (1.3) (24,343) (2.2) (11,467) (2.0)\nOther 5,556 0.3 6,818 0.6 2,631 0.5\nIncome tax provision* 417,226 24.5 266,688 24.2 140,277 23.9\n* Due to rounding, percentages may not add\nWe are subject to state tax in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our state tax liability based upon the individual taxing authorities regulations, estimates of income by taxing jurisdiction, and our ability to utilize certain tax-saving strategies. Based on our estimate of the allocation of income or loss among the various taxing jurisdictions and changes in tax regulations and their impact on our tax strategies, we estimated that our rate for state income taxes, before federal benefit, will be 5.6% in fiscal 2022. Our state income tax rate, before federal benefit, was 5.8% and 5.6% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively\nThe following table provides information regarding the provision (benefit) for income taxes for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nFederal $ 343,524 $ 213,314 $ 114,204\nState 73,702 53,374 26,073\n$ 417,226 $ 266,688 $ 140,277\nCurrent $ 513,075 $ 254,873 $ 42,497\nDeferred (95,849) 11,815 97,780\n$ 417,226 $ 266,688 $ 140,277\nThe components of income taxes payable at October 31, 2022 and 2021 are set forth below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nCurrent $ 168,548 $ 8,047\nDeferred 122,931 207,233\n$ 291,479 $ 215,280\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance, beginning of year $ 5,780 $ 6,591 $ 7,897\nIncrease in benefit as a result of tax positions taken in prior years 296 624 512\nIncrease in benefit as a result of tax positions taken in current year 833 - 306\nDecrease in benefit as a result of lapse of statute of limitations (1,987) (1,435) (2,124)\nBalance, end of year $ 4,922 $ 5,780 $ 6,591\nThe statute of limitations has expired on our federal tax returns for fiscal years through 2018. The statute of limitations for our major state tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years.\nOur unrecognized tax benefits are included in the current portion of Income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If these unrecognized tax benefits reverse in the future, they would have a beneficial impact on our effective tax rate at that time. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change, but we are not able to provide a range of such change. The anticipated changes will be principally due to the expiration of tax statutes, settlements with taxing jurisdictions, increases due to new tax positions taken, and the accrual of estimated interest and penalties.\nThe amounts accrued for interest and penalties are included in the current portion of Income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides information as to the amounts recognized in our tax provision, before reduction for applicable taxes and reversal of previously accrued interest and penalties, of potential interest and penalties in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and the amounts accrued for potential interest and penalties at October 31, 2022 and 2021 (amounts in thousands):\nExpense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income\nFiscal year\n2022 $ 296\n2021 $ 376\n2020 $ 512\nAccrued at:\nOctober 31, 2022 $ 1,157\nOctober 31, 2021 $ 1,385\nThe components of net deferred tax assets and liabilities at October 31, 2022 and 2021 are set forth below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued expenses $ 50,164 $ 55,904\nImpairment charges 37,418 40,410\nInventory valuation differences 41,154 29,285\nStock-based compensation expense 17,064 16,543\nAmounts related to unrecognized tax benefits 203 262\nState tax, net operating loss carryforwards 24,185 46,339\nOther 1,691 1,877\nTotal assets 171,879 190,620\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nCapitalized interest 26,791 37,475\nDeferred income 226,929 319,587\nExpenses taken for tax purposes not for book 2,961 4,716\nDepreciation 19,391 18,689\nDeferred marketing 18,738 17,386\nTotal liabilities 294,810 397,853\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (122,931) $ (207,233)\nIn accordance with GAAP, we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. At October 31, 2022 and 2021, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred tax assets would be realized. Accordingly, at October 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have valuation allowances recorded against our federal or state deferred tax assets.\nWe file tax returns in the various states in which we do business. Each state has its own statutes regarding the use of tax loss carryforwards. Some of the states in which we do business do not allow for the carryforward of losses, while others allow for carryforwards for 5 years to 20 years.\n9. Stockholders Equity\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 400 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (common stock), and 15 million shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. At October 31, 2022, we had 109.6 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, 4.6 million shares of common stock reserved for outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, 4.9 million shares of common stock reserved for future stock option and award issuances, and 282,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. As of October 31, 2022, no shares of preferred stock have been issued.\nCash Dividends\nOn February 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of quarterly cash dividends to shareholders. In March 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.17 to $0.20 per share, which was previously increased to $0.17 from $0.11 in March 2021. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we declared and paid aggregate cash dividends of $0.77 , $0.62 and $0.44 per share, respectively, to our shareholders.\nStock Repurchase Program\nFrom time to time since fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors has renewed its authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchases), issuer tender offers or other financial arrangements or transactions for general corporate purposes, including to obtain shares for the Companys equity award and other employee benefit plans. Most recently, on May 17, 2022, our Board of Directors renewed its authorization to repurchase 20 million shares of our common stock and terminated, effective the same date, the existing authorization that had been in effect since March 10, 2020. The Board of Directors did not fix any expiration date for this repurchase program.\nThe following table provides information about the share repurchase programs for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nNumber of shares purchased (in thousands) 11,000 7,421 15,952\nAverage price per share $ 49.34 $ 50.97 $ 39.75\nRemaining authorization at October 31 (in thousands) 14,577 12,563 19,984\nTransfer Restriction\nOn March 17, 2010, our Board of Directors adopted a Certificate of Amendment to the Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the Certificate of Amendment). The Certificate of Amendment includes an amendment approved by our stockholders at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that restricts certain transfers of our common stock. The Certificate of Amendments transfer restrictions generally restrict any direct or indirect transfer of our common stock if the effect would be to increase the direct or indirect ownership of any Person (as defined in the Certificate of Amendment) from less than 4.95% to 4.95% or more of our common stock or increase the ownership percentage of a Person owning or deemed to own 4.95% or more of our common stock. Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of this restriction would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), for fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nBeginning balance $ (6,024) $ (7,198) $ (5,831)\nGains (losses) arising during the period 9,573 152 (2,477)\nLess: Tax expense (2,424) (316) (852)\nNet gains (losses) arising during the period 7,149 (164) (3,329)\nGains reclassified from AOCI to net income (1)\n1,805 1,801 1,491\nLess: Tax (expense) benefit (2)\n(455) (463) 471\nNet gains reclassified from AOCI to net income 1,350 1,338 1,962\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 8,499 1,174 (1,367)\nEnding balance $ 2,475 $ (6,024) $ (7,198)\nDerivative Instruments\nBeginning balance $ 7,133 $ - $ -\nGains on derivative instruments 37,539 9,383 -\nLess: Tax expense (9,505) (2,408) -\nNet gains on derivative instruments 28,034 6,975 -\n(Losses) gains reclassified from AOCI to net income (3)\n(32) 211 -\nLess: Tax benefit (expense) (2)\n8 (53) -\nNet (losses) gains reclassified from AOCI to net income (24) 158 -\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax 28,010 7,133 -\nEnding balance $ 35,143 $ 7,133 $ -\nTotal AOCI ending balance $ 37,618 $ 1,109 $ (7,198)\n(1) Reclassified to Other income - net\n(2) Reclassified to Income tax provision\n(3) Reclassified to Cost of revenues - home sales\n10. Stock-Based Benefit Plans\nWe grant stock options, restricted stock, and various types of restricted stock units to our employees and our non-employee directors under our stock incentive plans. Restricted stock unit awards may be based on performance conditions, market conditions or service over a requisite time period (time-based). On March 12, 2019, shareholders approved the Toll Brothers, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan), which succeeded the Toll Brothers, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan for Employees (2014) and the Toll Brothers, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Executive Directors (2016) with respect to equity awards granted after its adoption, and no additional equity awards may be granted under such prior plans. As a result, the Omnibus Plan is the sole plan out of which new equity awards may be granted to employees (including executive officers), directors and other eligible participants under the plan. The Omnibus Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options (solely to employees) and nonqualified stock options with a term of up to 10 years at a price not less than the market price of the stock at the date of grant. The Omnibus Plan also provides for the issuance of stock appreciation rights and restricted and unrestricted stock awards and stock units, which may be performance-based. Stock options and restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Plan generally vest over a four-year period for employees and a two-year period for non-employee directors. Shares issued upon the exercise of a stock option or settlement of restricted stock units are either from shares held in treasury or newly issued shares. At October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had 5.0 million; 5.7 million; and 6.7 million shares, respectively, available for grant under the plans.\nThe following table provides information regarding the amount of total stock-based compensation expense recognized by us for fiscal year 2022, 2021, and 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nTotal stock-based compensation expense recognized $ 21,095 $ 23,187 $ 24,326\nIncome tax benefit recognized $ 5,312 $ 5,910 $ 6,227\nAt October 31, 2022, the aggregate unamortized value of outstanding stock-based compensation awards was approximately $15.5 million and the weighted-average period over which we expect to recognize such compensation costs was approximately 2.4 years.\nStock Options:\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model that uses ranges of assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities were based on a combination of implied volatilities from traded options on our stock, historical volatility of our stock, and other factors. The expected lives of options granted were derived from the historical exercise patterns and anticipated future patterns and represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The ranges set forth below result from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behaviors impacting exercisability. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions and fair value used for stock option grants in each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nExpected volatility 43.65% 43.33% 27.42% - 28.30%\nWeighted-average volatility 43.65% 43.33% 27.42%\nRisk-free interest rate 1.23% 0.49% 1.72% - 1.78%\nExpected life (years) 5.75 5.75 4.64 - 5.76\nDividends 1.01% 0.96% 1.11%\nWeighted-average fair value per share of options granted\n$24.36 $15.88 $9.68\nThe fair value of stock option grants is recognized evenly over the vesting period of the options or over the period between the grant date and the time the option becomes nonforfeitable by the employee, whichever is shorter.

The number of shares earned for Performance-Based RSUs is based on the attainment of certain operational performance metrics approved by the Executive Compensation Committee in the year of grant. The number of shares underlying the Performance-Based RSUs that may be issued to the recipients ranges from 0% to 150% of the base award depending on actual achievement as compared to the target performance goals. Shares earned based on actual performance vest pro-rata over a four-year period (provided the recipients continue to be employed by us as specified in the award document) or cliff-vest at the end of a three-year performance period.\nThe value of the Performance-Based RSUs was determined to be equal to the estimated number of shares of our common stock to be issued multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the date the Performance-Based RSU awards were approved by the Executive Compensation Committee (Valuation Date), adjusted for post-vesting restrictions applicable to retirement eligible participants. Compensation expense related to these grants is based on the Companys performance against the related performance criteria, the elapsed portion of the performance period and the grant date fair value of the award. To estimate the fair value of the award, we evaluate the performance goals quarterly and estimate the number of shares underlying the Performance-Based RSUs that are probable of being issued.\nA summary of the status of our nonvested Performance-Based RSUs as of October 31, 2022, and changes during the year ended October 31, 2022, is presented below (share amounts in thousands):\n2022 Weighted-average grant date fair value\nNonvested at November 1, 329 $ 35.87\nGranted/Target 72 $ 53.45\nVested (121) $ 37.19\nNonvested at October 31, 280 $ 39.79\nThe following table provides information regarding the issuance, valuation assumptions, and amortization of the Performance-Based RSUs issued in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nEstimated number of shares underlying Performance-Based RSUs to be issued 71,576 128,894 116,423\nAggregate number of Performance-Based RSUs outstanding at October 31 507,604 539,592 579,115\nWeighted-average fair value per share of Performance-Based RSUs issued $ 45.41 $ 29.87 $ 32.55\nAggregate grant date fair value of Performance-Based RSUs issued (in thousands) $ 6,156 $ 5,030 $ 3,790\nPerformance-Based RSU expense recognized (in thousands) $ 4,346 $ 5,989 $ 5,986\nFair market value of Performance-Based RSUs vested (in thousands) $ 4,514 $ 5,084 $ 5,638\nShares earned with respect to Performance-Based RSUs granted in December 2015, 2016, and 2017 were delivered in fiscal 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Units:\nWe issue time-based restricted stock units (Time-Based RSUs) to various officers, employees, and non-employee directors on an annual basis. These Time-Based RSUs generally vest in annual installments over a two-year (for non-employee directors) or four-year (for employees) period and are generally settled at the end of such period. The value of the Time-Based RSUs are determined to be equal to the number of shares of our common stock underlying the Time-Based RSUs multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the date the Time-Based RSUs are awarded, adjusted for post-vesting restrictions applicable to retirement eligible participants. The fair value of Time-Based RSUs is expensed evenly over the shorter of the vesting period or the period between the grant date and the time the award becomes nonforfeitable by the participant.\nA summary of our Time-Based RSUs nonvested shares as of October 31, 2022, and changes during the year ended October 31, 2022, is presented below (share amounts in thousands):\n2022 Weighted-average grant date fair value\nNonvested at November 1, 911 $ 39.45\nGranted 316 $ 61.77\nVested (348) $ 39.96\nForfeited (37) $ 49.36\nNonvested at October 31, 842 $ 47.18\nThe following table provides additional information on the Time-Based RSUs for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\nTime-Based RSUs issued:\nNumber of Time-Based RSUs issued 276,421 386,017 461,280\nWeighted-average fair value per share of Time-Based RSUs issued $ 45.55 $ 33.21 $ 37.43\nAggregate fair value of Time-Based RSUs issued (in thousands) $ 12,591 $ 12,820 $ 17,267\nTime-Based RSU expense recognized (in thousands): $ 15,738 $ 14,531 $ 12,744\nFair market value of Time-Based RSUs vested (in thousands): $ 13,925 $ 14,029 $ 11,837\n2022 2021 2020\nAt October 31:\nAggregate number of Time-Based RSUs outstanding 1,315,303 1,312,710 1,315,371\nCumulative unamortized value of Time-Based RSUs (in thousands)\n$ 14,902 $ 12,919 $ 10,972\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)\nOur ESPP enables substantially all employees to purchase our common stock at 95% of the market price of the stock on specified offering dates without restriction or at 85% of the market price of the stock on specified offering dates subject to restrictions. The ESPP, which is scheduled to terminate in December 2027, provides that 500,000 shares be reserved for purchase. At October 31, 2022, 282,000 shares were available for issuance. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we issued 38,932 shares, 31,257 shares, and 54,235 shares under the ESPP, respectively. The expense recognized in all fiscal periods was not material.\n11. Earnings Per Share Information\nInformation pertaining to the calculation of earnings per share for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, is as follows (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nNumerator:\nNet income as reported $ 1,286,500 $ 833,627 $ 446,624\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average shares 116,771 124,100 130,095\nCommon stock equivalents (1)\n1,204 1,707 1,152\nDiluted weighted-average shares 117,975 125,807 131,247\nOther information:\nWeighted-average number of antidilutive options and restricted stock units (2)\n410 166 2,141\nShares issued under stock incentive and employee stock purchase plans 507 1,011 1,541\n(1)Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of outstanding in-the-money stock options using the treasury stock method and shares expected to be issued under our restricted stock units programs.\n(2)Weighted-average number of antidilutive options and restricted stock units are based upon the average of the average quarterly closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE for the year.\n12. Fair Value Disclosures\nFinancial Instruments\nA summary of assets and (liabilities) at October 31, 2022 and 2021, related to our financial instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, is set forth below (amounts in thousands):\nFair value\nFinancial Instrument Fair value hierarchy October 31, 2022 October 31, 2021\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale Level 2 $ 185,150 $ 247,211\nForward Loan Commitments - Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale Level 2 $ 9,184 $ 1,782\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs) Level 2 $ (17,734) $ (1,773)\nForward Loan Commitments - IRLCs Level 2 $ 17,734 $ 1,773\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts Level 2 $ 45,010 $ 10,330\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and customer deposits held in escrow approximated fair value.\nThe fair values of the interest rate swap contracts are included in Receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis based on the expected cash flows of each swap contract. Although the Company has determined that the significant inputs, such as interest yield curve and discount rate, used to value its interest rate swap contracts fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our counterparties and our own credit risk utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our interest rate swap contract positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our interest rate swap contracts. As a result, we have determined that our interest rate swap contracts valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale\nAt the end of the reporting period, we determine the fair value of our mortgage loans held for sale and the forward loan commitments we have entered into as a hedge against the interest rate risk of our mortgage loans and commitments using the market approach to determine fair value. The evaluation is based on the current market pricing of mortgage loans with similar terms and values as of the reporting date and the application of such pricing to the mortgage loan portfolio. We recognize the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans held for sale as a gain or loss. In addition, we recognize the change in fair value of our forward loan commitments as a gain or loss. These gains and losses are included in Other income - net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is calculated based upon the stated interest rate of each loan and is also included in Other income - net.\nThe table below provides, for the periods indicated, the aggregate unpaid principal and fair value of mortgage loans held for sale as of the date indicated (amounts in thousands):\nAt October 31, Aggregate unpaid\nprincipal balance Fair value Fair value greater (less) than principal balance\n2022 $ 193,746 $ 185,150 $ (8,596)\n2021 $ 244,467 $ 247,211 $ 2,744\nIRLCs represent individual borrower agreements that commit us to lend at a specified price for a specified period as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contract. These commitments have varying degrees of interest rate risk. We utilize best-efforts forward loan commitments (Forward Commitments) to hedge the interest rate risk of the IRLCs and residential mortgage loans held for sale. Forward Commitments represent contracts with third-party investors for the future delivery of loans whereby we agree to make delivery at a specified future date at a specified price. The IRLCs and Forward Commitments are considered derivative financial instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires derivative financial instruments to be recorded at fair value. We estimate the fair value of such commitments based on the estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan and, in the case of IRLCs, the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC. The fair values of IRLCs and forward loan commitments are included in either Receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets or Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. To\nmanage the risk of non-performance of investors regarding the Forward Commitments, we assess the creditworthiness of the investors on a periodic basis.\nInventory\nWe recognize inventory impairment charges based on the difference in the carrying value of the inventory and its fair value at the time of the evaluation. The fair value of the aforementioned inventory was determined using Level 3 criteria. Estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies - Inventory, for additional information regarding our methodology on determining fair value. As further discussed in Note 1, determining the fair value of a communitys inventory involves a number of variables, many of which are interrelated. If we used a different input for any of the various unobservable inputs used in our impairment analysis, the results of the analysis may have been different, absent any other changes. Impairments on operating communities were insignificant in each of the three fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 and, accordingly, we did not disclose the ranges of certain quantitative unobservable inputs utilized in determining the fair value of such impaired operating communities.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $19.7 million, $19.8 million and $31.7 million of impairment charges on land owned for future communities relating to four, six and nine communities, respectively. As of the period the impairment charges were recognized, the estimated fair value of these communities in the aggregate, net of impairment charges, were $49.5 million, $23.9 million, and $21.8 million respectively. For the majority of these communities, the estimated fair values were determined based upon the expected sales price per lot in a community sale to another builder. The range of sales price per lot utilized in determining fair values was approximately $25,000 - $500,000 per lot.\nDebt\nThe table below provides, as of the dates indicated, the book value and estimated fair value of our debt at October 31, 2022 and 2021 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nFair value hierarchy Book value Estimated\nfair value Book value Estimated\nfair value\nLoans payable (1)\nLevel 2 $ 1,187,043 $ 1,180,893 $ 1,014,042 $ 1,021,662\nSenior notes (2)\nLevel 1 2,000,000 1,822,255 2,409,856 2,577,818\nMortgage company loan facility (3)\nLevel 2 148,863 148,863 147,512 147,512\n$ 3,335,906 $ 3,152,011 $ 3,571,410 $ 3,746,992\n(1)The estimated fair value of loans payable was based upon contractual cash flows discounted at interest rates that we believed were available to us for loans with similar terms and remaining maturities as of the applicable valuation date.\n(2)The estimated fair value of our senior notes is based upon their market prices as of the applicable valuation date.\n(3)We believe that the carrying value of our mortgage company loan borrowings approximates their fair value.\n13. Employee Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans\nSalary Deferral Savings Plans\nWe maintain salary deferral savings plans covering substantially all employees. We recognized an expense, net of plan forfeitures, with respect to the plans of $17.1 million, $15.5 million, and $6.1 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which is included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe have an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that permits eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. The deferred compensation, together with certain of our contributions, earns various rates of return depending upon when the compensation was deferred. A portion of the deferred compensation and interest earned may be forfeited by a participant if he or she elects to withdraw the compensation prior to the end of the deferral period. We accrued $35.7 million and $36.3 million at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for our obligations under the plan.\nDefined Benefit Retirement Plans\nWe have two unfunded defined benefit retirement plans. Retirement benefits generally vest when the participant reaches normal retirement age. Unrecognized prior service costs are being amortized over the period from the date participants enter the plans until their interests are fully vested. We used a 5.26%, 2.27%, and 1.95% discount rate in our calculation of the present value of our projected benefit obligations at October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The rates represent the approximate long-\nterm investment rate at October 31 of the fiscal year for which the present value was calculated. Information related to the plans is based on actuarial information calculated as of October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nInformation related to our retirement plans for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, is as follows (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nPlan costs:\nService cost $ 261 $ 452 $ 453\nInterest cost 1,055 926 1,158\nAmortization of prior service cost 1,806 1,723 1,468\nAmortization of unrecognized losses - 77 23\n$ 3,122 $ 3,178 $ 3,102\nProjected benefit obligation:\nBeginning of year $ 47,705 $ 48,374 $ 45,070\nPlan amendments adopted during year - 755 2,600\nService cost 261 452 453\nInterest cost 1,055 926 1,158\nBenefit payments (2,544) (1,894) (1,636)\nChange in unrecognized (gain) loss (9,573) (908) 729\nProjected benefit obligation, end of year $ 36,904 $ 47,705 $ 48,374\nUnamortized prior service cost:\nBeginning of year $ 5,484 $ 6,452 $ 5,320\nPlan amendments adopted during year - 755 2,600\nAmortization of prior service cost (1,806) (1,723) (1,468)\nUnamortized prior service cost, end of year $ 3,678 $ 5,484 $ 6,452\nAccumulated unrecognized gain (loss), October 31 $ 7,285 $ (2,288) $ (3,273)\nAccumulated benefit obligation, October 31 $ 36,904 $ 47,705 $ 48,374\nAccrued benefit obligation, October 31 $ 36,904 $ 47,705 $ 48,374\nThe accrued benefit obligation is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe table below provides, based upon the estimated retirement dates of the participants in the retirement plans, the amounts of benefits we would be required to pay in each of the next five fiscal years and for the five fiscal years ended October 31, 2032 in the aggregate (in thousands):\nYear ending October 31, Amount\n2023 $ 2,780\n2024 $ 3,108\n2025 $ 3,381\n2026 $ 3,629\n2027 $ 3,614\nNovember 1, 2027 - October 31, 2032 $ 16,836\n14. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various claims and litigation arising principally in the ordinary course of business. We believe that adequate provision for resolution of all current claims and pending litigation has been made and that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity or on our financial condition.\nLand Purchase Contracts\nGenerally, our agreements to acquire land parcels do not require us to purchase those land parcels, although we, in some cases, forfeit any deposit balance outstanding if and when we terminate an agreement. If market conditions are weak, approvals needed to develop the land are uncertain, or other factors exist that make the purchase undesirable, we may choose not to acquire the land. Whether a purchase agreement is legally terminated or not, we review the amount recorded for the land parcel subject to the purchase agreement to determine whether the amount is recoverable. While we may not have formally terminated the purchase agreements for those land parcels that we do not expect to acquire, we write off any nonrefundable deposits and costs previously capitalized to such land parcels in the periods that we determine such costs are not recoverable.\nInformation regarding our land purchase contracts at October 31, 2022 and 2021, is provided in the table below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nAggregate purchase price:\nUnrelated parties $ 4,279,660 $ 4,442,804\nUnconsolidated entities that the Company has investments in 42,057 9,953\nTotal $ 4,321,717 $ 4,452,757\nDeposits against aggregate purchase price $ 463,452 $ 336,363\nAdditional cash required to acquire land 3,858,265 4,116,394\nTotal $ 4,321,717 $ 4,452,757\nAmount of additional cash required to acquire land included in accrued expenses $ 34,994 $ 37,447\nIn addition, we expect to purchase approximately 6,700 additional home sites over a number of years from several joint ventures in which we have investments; the purchase prices of these home sites will be determined at a future date.\nAt October 31, 2022, we also had similar purchase contracts to acquire land for apartment developments of approximately $308.8 million, of which we had outstanding deposits in the amount of $9.6 million. We intend to develop these projects in joint ventures with unrelated parties in the future.\nWe have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAt October 31, 2022, we had investments in a number of unconsolidated entities, were committed to invest or advance additional funds, and had guaranteed a portion of the indebtedness and/or loan commitments of these entities. See Note 4, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, for more information regarding our commitments to these entities.\nSurety Bonds and Letters of Credit\nAt October 31, 2022, we had outstanding surety bonds amounting to $796.5 million, primarily related to our obligations to governmental entities to construct improvements in our communities. We estimate that $413.1 million of work remains on these improvements. We have an additional $274.6 million of surety bonds outstanding that guarantee other obligations. We do not believe it is probable that any outstanding bonds will be drawn upon.\nAt October 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit of $117.7 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. These letters of credit were issued to secure our various financial obligations, including insurance policy deductibles and other claims, land deposits, and security to complete improvements in communities in which we are operating. We do not believe that it is probable that any outstanding letters of credit will be drawn upon.\nAt October 31, 2022, we had provided financial guarantees of $25.7 million related to fronted letters of credit to secure obligations related to certain of our insurance policy deductibles and other claims.\nBacklog\nAt October 31, 2022, we had agreements of sale outstanding to deliver 8,098 homes with an aggregate sales value of $8.87 billion.\nMortgage Commitments\nOur mortgage subsidiary provides mortgage financing for a portion of our home closings. For those home buyers to whom our mortgage subsidiary provides mortgages, we determine whether the home buyer qualifies for the mortgage based upon information provided by the home buyer and other sources. For those home buyers who qualify, our mortgage subsidiary provides the home buyer with a mortgage commitment that specifies the terms and conditions of a proposed mortgage loan based upon then-current market conditions. Prior to the actual closing of the home and funding of the mortgage, the home buyer will lock in an interest rate based upon the terms of the commitment. At the time of rate lock, our mortgage subsidiary agrees to sell the proposed mortgage loan to one of several outside recognized mortgage financing institutions (investors) that is willing to honor the terms and conditions, including interest rate, committed to the home buyer. We believe that these investors have adequate financial resources to honor their commitments to our mortgage subsidiary.\nMortgage loans are sold to investors with limited recourse provisions derived from industry-standard representations and warranties in the relevant agreements. These representations and warranties primarily involve the absence of misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties, the appropriate underwriting of the loan and in some cases, a required minimum number of payments to be made by the borrower. The Company generally does not retain any other continuing interest related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market.\nInformation regarding our mortgage commitments at October 31, 2022 and 2021, is provided in the table below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\nAggregate mortgage loan commitments:\nIRLCs $ 669,631 $ 528,127\nNon-IRLCs 2,429,063 2,705,772\nTotal $ 3,098,694 $ 3,233,899\nInvestor commitments to purchase:\nIRLCs $ 669,631 $ 528,127\nMortgage loans receivable 186,666 244,376\nTotal $ 856,297 $ 772,503\nLease Commitments\nWe lease certain facilities, equipment, and properties held for rental apartment operation or development under non-cancelable operating leases which, in the case of certain rental properties, have an initial term of 99 years. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet for all leases with an expected term over one year. A majority of our facility lease agreements include rental payments based on a pro-rata share of the lessors operating costs which are variable in nature. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nROU assets are classified within Receivables, prepaid expenses, and other assets and the corresponding lease liability is included in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise. For such leases, we do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities and instead recognize lease payments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis. At October 31, 2022, ROU assets and lease liabilities were $116.7 million and $139.7 million, respectively. At October 31, 2021, ROU assets and lease liabilities were $96.3 million and $116.2 million, respectively. Payments on lease liabilities totaled $17.7 million and $19.4 million for the years ending October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLease expense includes costs for leases with terms in excess of one year as well as short-term leases with terms of one year or less. For the fiscal years ending October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our total lease expense was $25.6 million, $22.2 million, and $24.7 million, respectively, inclusive of variable lease costs of approximately $3.3 million, $3.1 million, and $3.1 million, respectively. Short-term lease costs and sublease income was de minimis.\nInformation regarding our remaining lease payments as of October 31, 2022 is provided in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nYear ended October 31,\n2023 $ 21,141\n2024 19,153\n2025 16,048\n2026 15,112\n2027 11,520\nThereafter 258,687\nTotal lease payments (1)\n$ 341,661\nLess: Interest (2)\n201,997\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 139,664\n(1) Lease payments include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised.\n(2) Our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we estimate our discount rate for such leases to determine the present value of lease payments at the lease commencement date.\nThe majority of our facility leases give us the option to extend the lease term. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our discretion. For several of our facility leases we are reasonably certain the option will be exercised and thus the renewal term has been included in our calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate used in calculating these facility lease liabilities, excluding our land leases, were 7.8 years and 4.8%, respectively, at October 31, 2022 and 8.1 years and 4.0%, respectively, at October 31, 2021.\nWe have a small number of land leases with initial terms of 99 years. We are not reasonably certain that, if given the option, we would extend these leases. We have therefore excluded the renewal terms from our ROU asset and lease liability for these leases. The weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate used in calculating these land lease liabilities were 93.5 years and 4.5%, respectively, at October 31, 2022 and 93.4 years and 4.5%, respectively, at October 31, 2021.\n15.

As a result, net of legal fees and expenses, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $148.4 million, of which $141.2 million was recorded in Other Income - net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in fiscal 2022. The remainder was recorded as an offset to previously incurred expenses. Coincident with this settlement, we seeded a new Toll Brothers charitable foundation with $10.0 million which was recorded in Selling, general and administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in fiscal 2022.\nManagement fee income from Land Development and Home Building Joint Ventures - net includes fees earned by our City Living and home building operations.\nIncome from ancillary businesses is generated by our mortgage, title, landscaping, smart home technology, Gibraltar, apartment living, and golf course and country club operations. The table below provides revenues and expenses for these ancillary\nbusinesses for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenues $ 135,510 $ 139,640 $ 118,855\nExpenses $ 110,842 $ 102,929 $ 106,285\nOther income $ - $ - $ 12,970\nIn fiscal 2022, our smart home technology business recognized a $9.0 million gain from a bulk sale of security monitoring accounts, which is included in income from ancillary businesses above.\nIn fiscal 2020, we sold one of our golf club properties to a third party for $15.6 million and recognized a gain of $9.1 million. In addition, we recognized a previously deferred gain of $3.8 million related to the sale of a golf club property from fiscal 2019.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, our apartment living operations earned fees from unconsolidated entities of $23.2 million, $20.2 million, and $14.0 million, respectively. Fees earned by our apartment living operations are included in income from ancillary businesses.\n16. Information on Segments\nThe table below summarizes revenue and income (loss) before income taxes for our segments for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (amounts in thousands). At October 31, 2022, we concluded that our City Living operations were no longer a reportable operating segment, primarily due to its insignificance as a result of the change in structure and shift in strategy for its operations. Therefore, we concluded we have five operating segments as reflected below. Amounts reported in prior periods have been restated to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.\nRevenue Income (loss) before income taxes\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\n(restated) (restated) (restated) (restated)\nNorth $ 1,853,720 $ 2,011,896 $ 1,480,187 $ 280,829 $ 313,694 $ 87,576\nMid-Atlantic 1,148,966 1,076,900 851,106 189,485 128,494 52,024\nSouth 1,519,600 1,183,272 1,041,204 249,665 153,799 108,396\nMountain 2,747,783 2,003,045 1,535,757 509,512 276,360 167,554\nPacific 2,441,959 2,156,114 2,029,851 572,844 382,855 351,493\nTotal home building 9,712,028 8,431,227 6,938,105 1,802,335 1,255,202 767,043\nCorporate and other (1)\n(858) 519 (748) (98,609) (154,887) (180,142)\n9,711,170 8,431,746 6,937,357 1,703,726 1,100,315 586,901\nLand sales and other revenue 564,388 358,615 140,302\nTotal consolidated $ 10,275,558 $ 8,790,361 $ 7,077,659 $ 1,703,726 $ 1,100,315 $ 586,901\n(1) Included in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 is a $141.2 million net gain related to a favorable litigation settlement as further discussed in Note 15, Other Income - Net.\nCorporate and other is comprised principally of general corporate expenses such as our executive offices; the corporate finance, accounting, audit, tax, human resources, risk management, information technology, marketing, and legal groups; interest income; income from certain of our ancillary businesses, including our apartment rental development business; and income from our Rental Property Joint Ventures and Gibraltar Joint Ventures.\nTotal assets for each of our segments at October 31, 2022 and 2021, are shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021\n(restated)\nNorth $ 1,464,995 $ 1,624,420\nMid-Atlantic 1,049,043 995,852\nSouth 2,137,568 1,421,612\nMountain 2,785,603 2,397,484\nPacific 2,174,065 2,221,752\nTotal home building 9,611,274 8,661,120\nCorporate and other 2,677,440 2,876,730\nTotal consolidated $ 12,288,714 $ 11,537,850\nCorporate and other is comprised principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, deferred tax assets, investments in our Rental Property Joint Ventures, expected recoveries from insurance carriers and suppliers, our Gibraltar investments and operations, manufacturing facilities, and our mortgage and title subsidiaries.\nInventory for each of our segments, as of the dates indicated, is shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nLand controlled for future communities Land owned for future communities Operating communities Total\nBalances at October 31, 2022\nNorth $ 25,876 $ 125,762 $ 1,142,060 $ 1,293,698\nMid-Atlantic 50,425 245,208 700,844 996,477\nSouth 67,173 190,081 1,570,059 1,827,313\nMountain 15,890 119,315 2,523,027 2,658,232\nPacific 81,387 128,485 1,747,734 1,957,606\nTotal consolidated $ 240,751 $ 808,851 $ 7,683,724 $ 8,733,326\nBalances at October 31, 2021 (restated) (restated) (restated)\nNorth $ 24,791 $ 202,273 $ 1,229,298 $ 1,456,362\nMid-Atlantic 51,267 109,693 776,746 937,706\nSouth 34,567 44,304 1,135,370 1,214,241\nMountain 40,483 85,631 2,126,863 2,252,977\nPacific 34,548 122,836 1,897,214 2,054,598\nTotal consolidated $ 185,656 $ 564,737 $ 7,165,491 $ 7,915,884\nThe amounts we have provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable for each of our segments, for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, are shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\n2022 2021 2020\n(restated)\nNorth $ 11,860 $ 12,194 $ 28,352\nMid-Atlantic 3,369 12,022 17,905\nSouth 3,391 662 2,869\nMountain 4,091 379 790\nPacific 10,030 1,278 5,967\nTotal consolidated $ 32,741 $ 26,535 $ 55,883\nThe net carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated entities and our equity in earnings (losses) from such investments, for each of our segments, as of the dates indicated, are shown in the table below (amounts in thousands):\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities Equity in earnings (losses) from\nunconsolidated entities\nAt October 31, Year ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2020\n(restated) (restated) (restated)\nNorth $ 49,385 $ 12,944 $ 1,068 $ (641) $ (7,674)\nMid-Atlantic 26,171 27,313 (405) 5,953 (11)\nSouth 174,901 128,777 20,065 12,619 14,012\nMountain 53,046 14,612 494 - 381\nPacific 89,196 73,066 248 (17) 1,280\nTotal home building 392,699 256,712 21,470 17,914 7,988\nCorporate and other 459,615 342,389 2,253 56,121 (7,040)\nTotal consolidated $ 852,314 $ 599,101 $ 23,723 $ 74,035 $ 948\nCorporate and other is comprised of our investments in the Rental Property Joint Ventures and the Gibraltar Joint Ventures.\n17.
