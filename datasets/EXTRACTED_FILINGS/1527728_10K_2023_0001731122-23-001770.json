The Company will not distinguish between its prior and current corporate name and will refer to the Companys current corporate name throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms \"Renovaro,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" in this document refer to Renovaro BioSciences Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries.\niii\nPART I\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this prospectus to we, us, our, Renovaro BioSciences or the Company are to Renovaro BioSciences Inc., a Delaware corporation together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Renovaro Biopharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Renovaro Biopharma) Renovaro Biosciences Denmark ApS, a Danish limited company, organized under the Danish Act on Limited Companies of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Renovaro Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Renovaro Technologies).\nOur Business\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to developing advanced allogeneic cell and gene therapies to promote stronger immune system responses potentially for long-term or life-long cancer remission in some of the deadliest cancers, and potentially to treat or cure serious infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\nOur Product Development strategy is anchored in the use of non-self or allogeneic cells that enhance the immune response that we seek to elicit.\nOver the past several years, Renovaro BioSciences has evolved from a company with a single product candidate as a potential cure for HIV, adding two additional pipeline candidates for HIV, a pipeline for HBV, and with a significant expansion into cancer immune therapies to address high unmet needs from difficult-to-treat solid tumors.\nThe oncology platform is now at the forefront of our development activities, beginning with pancreatic cancer.\nMany operational aspects of our platforms can be quickly adapted to multiple disease states from a single therapeutic approach, potentially streamlining and accelerating development, and regulatory process, as well as manufacturing operations. Moreover, because our product candidates do not require specialized delivery devices and surgical procedures, our potentially groundbreaking interventions could have worldwide applicability.\nThe Company responds quickly to new data and perceived development opportunities and risk assessments. Based on the maturation of our pipelines, the Company makes business decisions to prioritize the programs that could move more rapidly through development and commercial processes.\nTherapeutic Areas of focus\nSolid Tumors\nCancer is caused by an uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. The immune system plays a key role in identifying and destroying those abnormal cells. In the past 10 years, there has been significant investment in research and development to retrain the immune system in people with cancer to restore the effectiveness of that immune response - so called immune-therapy. Immune-therapies have made substantial advances to treat various types of blood cell-derived cancers. However, solid tumors still represent a key challenge for long-term remission or cure. Certain solid tumors have evolved mechanisms that can either hide from normal immune control and immune-therapies or release certain signaling factors that can block attempts by the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.\nRenovaro Biosciences is developing innovative, proprietary approaches that involve gene- and/or cell-therapy to promote cancer fighting cells that are designed to potentially overcome those mechanisms and enhance the ability of a person living with a solid tumor to more easily recognize cancer cells and mount a much more robust and effective immune reaction to destroy them.\nPancreatic cancer remains a very deadly disease with only 5-10 percent of patients surviving 5 years. Initial preclinical in vitro and proof of concept in vivo studies of our immune-therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer have demonstrated promising results.\nThe flexibility provided by the platform technology for quick adaptations during research and development and manufacturing processes could accelerate the development of potential products for other solid tumors beyond pancreatic cancer. For example, triple-negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma are all solid tumors with poor survival rates and limited treatment options. The platform might also allow for non-specific immune enhancement that could have impact against a broad array of solid tumors. As currently conceived, our approach could potentially allow for outpatient therapy without significant impairment of the patients immune system, as many current approaches require.\nBecause many types of solid tumors do not have adequate therapies, are difficult to treat and have relatively low survival rates, there is a large market potential.\nInfectious Diseases\nInfectious diseases such as HIV and HBV cause disease and death in hundreds of millions of people every year. In a similar way to solid tumors, those viruses escape from natural immune response by hiding inside of human cells, creating sanctuaries or reservoirs of infection that can evade the immune system. Advances in anti-viral drugs have made a huge impact on the ability to extend and improve the quality of life for many, but are often associated with side effects, and can be very expensive.\nThrough its advanced cell- and gene- therapy platforms, Renovaro BioSciences is developing unique tools potentially to enhance a persons ability to both recognize and fight infections. Because those mechanisms aim to eliminate the cells that serve as a reservoir for viral replication, our therapy could potentially either cure or at least provide long term remission to people living with chronic infections.\nHIV\nHIV attacks the human immune system, specifically killing off CD4+ T-cells, a central part of a persons ability to control other infections and certain cancers. Left untreated, over time, the number of CD4+ T-cells drops to such low levels that people die from those infections and cancers.\nThanks to scientific advances, there are over 30 antiretroviral drugs, or ARVs, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat HIV that can allow many people to live almost as long as people without HIV. But, as mentioned, the drugs are expensive, require taking pills every day, and can have significant side effects over time.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 30 million people are living with HIV. In addition, as many as 1 million people, including people in high-income countries, continue to die each year from HIV due to the ability of the virus to evolve to evade the effects of the drugs, in particular in people who have been taking various drugs for many years. To date, there are no treatments that can eliminate the reservoir of immune cells that are infected with HIV from the body. Consequently, treatment for HIV is life-long.\nHBV\nDespite the availability of an effective vaccine and treatment that can control infection if it is taken daily for life, HBV is the worlds most common serious liver infection. According to the Hepatitis B Foundation, two billion people have been infected with HBV, approximately 300 million have chronic HBV infection, and nearly one million people die every year around the world. HBV remains the leading cause of liver cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the world.\nWhile vaccines are increasingly required for children, many adults have not been vaccinated. Life-long treatment access can be limited and also can be difficult for certain people to follow due to its side effects.\nCurrent efforts to develop novel treatments or cure largely focus on approaches to deplete the pool of the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a type of HBV DNA that is the root cause of HBV chronicity. Renovaro Biosciences is exploring the development of an innovative gene therapy approach to co-opt HBV polymerase, a key factor that the virus needs to reproduce itself and to induce the death of liver cells infected with the virus.\nTherapeutic Platforms\nThe Companys general approach with gene- and/or cell-therapy is to enhance the immune system to allow a person to better fight diseases. The Company is leveraging general principals and advances in the knowledge of the immune response to engineer cells with enhanced attributes to promote the recognition and elimination of diseased cells.\nAdvanced Allogeneic Cell Therapy\nThe strategic benefit of cell therapy platforms is to potentially allow for manufacture of large, off-the-shelf banks of therapeutic cells that could be accessed on demand by health care professionals to potentially decrease the time between diagnosis and treatment.\nIn addition, because we focus on cells from donors the strategy could potentially enhance the ability of the therapeutic candidates to induce a more robust response once injected into patients. The human immune system is designed to recognize and distinguish self from non-self and destroy otherness such as bacteria, viruses, and damaged or diseased cells such as cancer cells. Alloreactivity (reacting against another persons cells) is the most powerful response the immune system generates. Several of our technologies take advantage of the alloreactivity to hyper stimulate a persons immune response to better attack a chronic infection (e.g., HIV) or solid tumor.\nIn certain treatments (e.g., HIV and cancer), cells taken from healthy donors are sometimes genetically modified to introduce signaling molecules that are designed to enhance the ability of specific immune cells to recognize diseased cells, and to help recruit other cells that will destroy cancer or virus infected cells.\nThe Company believes that the combination of off-the-shelf allogeneic cells, combined with genetic modifications designed to enhance immune signaling, could potentially generate therapeutic candidates that have unique attributes that will increase the likelihood of success.\nCell Therapy enabling technology\nIn addition to the platform described above, Renovaro BioSciences has an innovative gene therapy approach to enhance the selection and engraftment (uptake) of cells carrying therapeutic attributes. Enhanced uptake or engraftment could play a critical role in some cases to increase the likelihood of therapeutic benefit. This technology was initially developed for autologous cell therapy from a person living with HIV, and genetically modifying those cells so they cannot be infected with most variants of HIV plus a gene modification to enhance uptake. We have sublicensed under a profit-sharing agreement our technology to potentially increase engraftment for potential use in CAR-T therapy as a potential cure for HIV.\nHBV Gene Therapy\nRenovaro BioSciences is exploring various approaches for gene therapy design elements to potentially eliminate virus-infected cells with an innovative molecular mechanism that co-opts the virus machinery to induce the death of infected cells rather than reproducing and causing more infection and exacerbate diseases.\nOur Product Candidates\nOncology:\nRENB-DC-11: Genetically modified Allogeneic Dendritic Cell Therapeutic Vaccine as Potential Product for Long-term Remission of Solid Tumors - Starting with Pancreatic Cancer\nAllogeneic Cell Therapy Platform - Advanced Pre-Clinical\nBased on learning from peer-reviewed publications of Phase I/IIa trials, we have designed an innovative therapeutic vaccination platform that could potentially be used to induce life-long remission from some of the deadliest solid tumors. According to Cancer.net, the survival rate in pancreatic cancer is currently only 5 to 10 percent at 5 years.\nInitial preclinical in vitro and proof of concept in vivo studies have been successful for pancreatic tumors. The platform might also allow immediate applicability for a broad array of solid tumors. We initially plan to establish general clinical safety/tolerability for solid tumors in a phase 1 study and target pancreatic cancer and other potential solid tumors in a phase 2a study that could include triple-negative breast cancer, mesothelioma, head and neck cancer. As with HIV, our approach would potentially allow for outpatient therapy without wiping out or significantly impairing the patients immune system, as many current approaches require.\nRenovaro BioSciences is collaborating with Dr. Anahid Jewett from UCLA to study further the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of our therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer. Dr. Jewett created an innovative pancreatic cancer mouse model that reproduces the human immune system in combination with implanted human cancer cells. Early results show promising substantial tumor size reduction. We are now fully committed to process development/improvements with confirmatory in vivo data. We received constructive comments to our successful Pre-IND submission in May, which laid out our IND-enabling program for a possible IND submission in Q3 2024. If successful, clinical trials in humans could be possible shortly after in Q3 2024.\nRENB-DC-12--XX: Genetically modified Allogeneic Dendritic Cell Therapeutic Vaccine as Potential Product for Long-term Remission of Additional Indications\nThe technology is a platform that could potentially be adapted to other solid tumors first line and/or salvage therapy, by itself or, potentially, in combination with other cancer treatments. Additional indications are being evaluated strategically to balance risk and opportunity to advance therapeutic development quickly in cancer indications with few treatment options. Our strategy for early clinical development intends to explore and assess all options for accelerated development.\nInfectious Diseases:\nHIV:\nRENB-HV 12: HIV Therapeutic Vaccines for Potential Long-term Remission/Cure\nAllogeneic Cell Therapy Platform - Advanced Pre-Clinical Stage; Non-Human Primate Studies Ongoing.\nIn persons living with HIV who are controlling the spread of virus with anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment, boosting the immune system in a different way than the virus already has through infection could allow for control of HIV after stopping ARVs.\nRenovaro BioSciences is developing RENB-HV-12 that utilizes a novel cellular and immunotherapy approach that could potentially provide therapeutic vaccines for HIV (RENB-HV-12). A non-human primate study of the therapeutic vaccine in primates at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is ongoing. Animals began receiving the first injections of the potential therapeutic vaccine in August 2022. Preliminary results are starting to be available and being analyzed. A Pre-IND request could be submitted during the first half of 2024, with IND submission and the beginning of Phase I clinical trials by the end of the second half of 2025.\nRENB-HV-01: Autologous Transplant with Genetically Modified Cells:\nFDA INTERACT Meeting Held February 2020 - Advanced Pre-Clinical Stage\nThere have been several efforts to cure HIV by re-engineering a persons own T cells so that these cells no longer express a special protein (C-C chemokine co-receptor type 5 or CCR5), which HIV uses to gain entry to them. A naturally occurring mutation that blocks expression of CCR5 on T cells occurs in ~1% of people living in or from Northern Europe with no known adverse effects. The Berlin patient, and more recently the London patient, were HIV-positive people who developed cancer and were treated with a bone marrow transplant with cells donated from people with this naturally occurring mutation of CCR5. The Berlin and London patients seem to have been effectively cured from HIV providing proof-of-concept that HIV can be cured. However, because the transplanted cells come from another person, such transplants carry high risk and can result in death in a significant proportion of patients. Given the success with these two patients, several researchers and companies have attempted to replicate this experience by genetically modifying T cells of HIV-positive patients to render them unable to be infected by HIV and then returning them to the patient. Because the transplanted cells are from the same person, the risks to the patient are much lower. The uptake, or engraftment of the modified T cells, however, has not been optimal, leading to failure to achieve a cure. In addition, the transplant pre-treatment that has been used is bone marrow-destroying chemotherapy, which wipes out the patients immune system and can have long-term side effects including the risk of developing cancer.\nWe have pioneered a novel enabling technology (ALDH gene modification) that we believe will allow sufficient engraftment of the CCR5 gene-modified Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) to eliminate the need for Antiretroviral Treatment (ART.)\nManagement conducted a successful FDA INTERACT Meeting in alignment with the Companys experimental plan. Although in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated promising results, further development of RENB-HV-01 at this time was deemed costly and a long-term undertaking. While the Company may return to full development of the approach when resources are available, it has become less attractive and been deprioritized for business reasons, while pipelines that could move more quickly have been prioritized (e.g., DC-11). Therefore, a business decision was made to sub-license the ALDH gene modification.\nRENB-HV-01 was sub-licensed to Caring Cross with a profit share arrangement. Caring Cross is developing a CAR-T approach that they believe, when combined with Renovaro Biosciences ALDH gene modification, could enhance engraftment of their CAR-T cell therapy and enhance their likelihood of success.\nRENB-HV-21: Immunotherapy with Allogeneic NK/GDT Cells\nAllogeneic Cell Therapy Platform -Pre-IND conducted - Advanced Pre-Clinical with Human Data through a Collaboration\nWe are also exploring RENB-HV-21, an innovative treatment for HIV with allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) and Gamma Delta T-Cells (GDT). It is believed that the GDT cells, a small subset of immune cells that can be infected with HIV, could both be infected by and be a key factor in controlling the virus. The initial scientific findings were presented during the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASCGT) Annual Meeting in 2021. Renovaro BioSciences has an exclusive license to use the underlying patent to develop RENB-HV-21 for potential treatment or cure of HIV. A successful investigator-initiated Pre-IND was completed in October 2021. However, due to a shift in priorities to the Oncology pipeline, Renovaro BioSciences does not plan to pursue the IND and potential clinical trial in the near to medium-term.\nHBV:\nRENB-HB-01: Potential Cure for HBV\nHBV Gene Therapy - Pre-Clinical\nRENB-HB-01 is in an early pre-clinical phase as we explore various approaches for gene therapy design elements. If those explorations are successful, it is possible we could begin the regulatory process at the earliest in the second half of 2024. However, our highest priority is currently the oncology platform, beginning with pancreatic cancer.\nCollaborations\nWe have established strategic partnerships with leading scientists and research centers, such as the University of California, Los Angeles, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Caring Cross for some of our programs. We will continue to pursue partnerships and collaborations when appropriate with selected philanthropic, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies to fund internal research and development activities, and to assist in product development and commercialization. We are applying our technology platform to several commercial applications in which our products provide us and our strategic partners and collaborators with potential technical, competitive, and economic advantages.\nOur Intellectual Property\nPatents and licenses are key to our business. Our strategy is to file for patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements to inventions that we consider important for the development of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as continuing technological innovations, proprietary knowledge, and various third-party agreements, including, without limitation, confidentiality agreements, materials transfer agreements, research agreements, and licensing agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and seek the protection of those rights so that we can fully exploit our innovations.\nWe also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Our patent filings are discussed briefly below.\nInternally Developed Intellectual Property\nProtocol for generating dendritic cells (2005 DK, 2008 PCT)\nThis patent family is directed to the generation of dendritic cells based on a blood sample by culturing monocytes at reduced temperatures. Dendritic cells exposed to tumor antigens followed by treatment with T(h) 1-polarizing differentiation signals have paved the way for the development of dendritic cell-based cancer vaccines. Issued claims are directed to a method of generating immature dendritic cells under certain temperature settings, which by further activation has been shown to give a high yield of homogeneous and fully matured dendritic cells. The patent expiration date is December 2026 subject to any applicable patent term extension, patent term adjustment, or supplementary protection certificates that may be available in a country or jurisdiction. This patent has been issued in the USA, Canada, China, Eurasia, Russia, Europe, Israel, Mexico, Malaysia, and New Zealand. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties.\nAssigned Intellectual Property\nOn August 16, 2022, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 11,413,338 B2, Methods and Compositions Using Recombinant Dendritic Cells for Cancer Therapy, pertaining to methods and compositions for treating cancer by eliciting an immune response by administering dendritic cells expressing heterologous proteins. This patent protects RENB-DC-11: Genetically modified Allogeneic Dendritic Cells as Potential Product for Long-term Remission of Solid Tumors - Starting with Pancreatic Cancer and potential future products RENB-DC-12-XX: Genetically modified Allogeneic Dendritic Cells as Potential Product for Long-term Remission of Additional Indications for twenty years. This patent is owned by the Company, through assignment as of July 15, 2019.\nOn June 17, 2020, a patent application was filed entitled Allogeneic T-Cell-Based HIV Vaccine to Induce Cellular and Humoral Immunity, US 2021/0030795 A1 for the composition and method of use concepts for HV-12. This patent application is owned by the Company, through assignment as of September 28, 2021.\nIn-Licensed Technology\nOn February 16, 2018, Renovaro Biopharma, Renovaros wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a License Agreement (the HIV License Agreement) with Weird Science, LLC (Weird Science). The License Agreement contains, among other things, the following terms: (a) a perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sublicensable, and exclusive (including to the exclusion of Weird Science) worldwide license from Weird Science to Renovaro Biopharma to use Weird Sciences intellectual property and technology for the prevention, treatment, and/or amelioration of and/or therapy for HIV in humans, and research and development exclusively relating to HIV in humans (the Field) worldwide; (b) a nonexclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license from Renovaro Biopharma to Weird Science to use the Renovaro technology to commercialize products outside of the Field worldwide; (c) a nonexclusive, royalty-free license from Renovaro Biopharma to Weird Science to use the results of a study with syngeneic and humanized mice models outside the Field and, at Weird Sciences own expense, to prosecute patents relating to the results of the study, which Weird Science will own, and (d) a perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sublicensable, and sole and exclusive (including to the exclusion of Weird Science) worldwide license from Weird Science to Renovaro Biopharma (which will be part of the license described in (a) above) to use patent applications and patents related to the study results disclosed in (d) above solely in the Field, and to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import inventions claimed in such patent applications and patents solely in the Field. Our current product candidates covered by this license include RENB-HV-01: Autologous Transplant with Genetically Modified Cells.\nOn January 31, 2020, the Company entered into a Statement of Work and License Agreement (the HBV License Agreement) by and among the Company, G Tech Bio, LLC (G-Tech), and Seraph Research Institute (SRI) (formerly G Health Research Foundation), and, a not for profit entity organized under the laws of California doing business as Seraph Research Institute (SRI), whereby the Company acquired a perpetual, sublicensable, exclusive license (the HBV License) for a treatment under development (aimed to treat HBV infections in accordance with its agreement in principle with G-Tech and SRI announced by the Company on November 25, 2019. The HBV License Agreement states that in consideration for the HBV License, the Company would provide cash funding for research costs and equipment and certain other in-kind funding related to the licensed treatment over a 24-month period. The Company paid an upfront payment of $1.2 million on February 6, 2020. Our current product candidate under this license is RENB-HB-01 HBV Gene Therapy (see Note 9 in the Financial Statements).\nOn August 25, 2021, the Company entered into an ALC Patent License and Research Funding Agreement in the HIV Field (the ALC License Agreement) with SRI whereby the Company was granted an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free license (the ALC License), with the right to sublicense, the proprietary technology subject to a U.S. patent application, to make, use, offer to sell, sell or import products for use solely for the prevention, treatment, amelioration of or therapy exclusively for HIV in humans, and research and development exclusively relating to HIV in humans; provided the licensor retained the right to conduct HIV research in the HIV Field. Pursuant to the ALC License Agreement, the Company granted a non-exclusive license back to licensor, under any patents or other intellectual property owned or controlled by the Company, to the extent arising from the ALC License, to make, use, offer to sell, sell or import products for use in the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, amelioration or therapy of any (i) HIV comorbidities and (ii) any other diseases or conditions outside the HIV Field. The Company made an initial payment to SRI of $600,000 and agreed to fund future HIV research, as mutually agreed to by the parties. Our current product candidate under this license is RENB-HV-21: HIV Natural Killer and Gamma Delta T Cell Treatment or Cure (see Note 9 in the Financial Statements).\nTrade Secrets and Proprietary Know-How\nIn addition to intellectual property protected by patents and copyrights, we have trade secrets and proprietary know-how relating to our products, production processes, and future strategies.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the field of gene therapy, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our technology platforms, strong intellectual property portfolio, and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, new market entrants, and new technologies.\nWe are aware of several companies focused on other methods for editing genes and regulating their expression, and a limited number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of gene regulation and genome editing technology. The field of applied gene regulation and genome editing is highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from several different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic and research institutions, and government agencies.\nAccordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval, or commercializing competitive products before us. If we commence commercial product sales, we may be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience. In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing products that have long histories of safe and effective use.\nThe competitive landscape that we are facing is as follows:\nGene therapy companies developing gene-based products in clinical trials. uniQure N.V.s product for lipoprotein lipase deficiency and GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSKs, product for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency are approved in Europe. No other gene therapy products have yet been approved. Our competitors in this category may include, but not be limited to, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., uniQure N.V., bluebird bio, Inc., Regenxbio Inc., Shire, Pfizer Pharmaceutical, and GSK.\nCell therapy companies developing cell-based products. Our competitors in this category may include Novartis AG, Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, and Iovance Biotechnologies, Inc.\nFor RENB-DC-11, the competitive landscape is more complex.\nImmunotherapy is an active area of research and a number of immune-related products have been identified in recent years that are alleged to modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T cell activation. More recently, bi-specific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors (for instance PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the T cell receptors (TCR), thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors on the other hand work by targeting receptors that inhibit T cell effectiveness and proliferation and essentially activate T cells. Other immunotherapies that are being actively investigated include antibody-drug complexes, TCR-mimic antibodies, oncolytic viruses, and cancer vaccines. A variety of cell-based autologous and allogeneic approaches are also being researched and developed.\nCAR-T in solid tumors\nIn addition to hematological malignancies, a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions are researching and developing autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies in the solid tumor setting. These CAR-T cell therapies are at a variety of stages of preclinical and clinical development, as well as directed towards a broad target spectrum. Four CAR-T therapies have been approved for treatment of leukemia.\nTCR T cells\nCompetitors are developing TCR T cells (including affinity engineered T cells) that are directed towards a multitude of targets. Juno Therapeutics has developed an engineered TCR therapeutic candidate where the end TCR is purported to have enhanced affinity through stem-cell selection.\nOther cell-based approaches\nIn addition to all the adoptive cell therapy approaches above, our competitors are also investigating the potential of Gamma Delta T cell, Chimeric Antigen Receptor - Natural Killer (CAR-NK) cell, Natural Killer (NK) cell, (NKT) cell and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) either in a preclinical or clinical setting (both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors). In addition, Bristol Myers Squibbs Abraxane is used for pancreatic cancer.\nFor RENB-HV-12, we are aware of a few biotech companies developing an HIV vaccine such as Geovax, Biosantech SA, and FIT Biotech, among a few others.\nFor RENB-HV-01, we are aware of two companies developing a gene therapy for HIV/AIDS: Sangamo and American Gene Technology.\nFor RENB-HB-01, there is an approved vaccine to prevent HBV infection. In addition, several approved combination antivirals can suppress replication, but do not cure HBV. Several companies are pursuing cures, mostly targeting the depletion of ccc-DNA.\nManufacturing\nOur intent is to rely on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs), to help develop processes and manufacture our product candidates in accordance with FDA and European Medicine Agency (EMA) mandated regulations, also known as current good manufacturing practices, (cGMPs). We employ a technical operations staff in the areas of process development, analytical development, quality control, quality assurance, project management, and manufacturing, which will facilitate appropriate oversight of our CMOs, support of our regulatory filings, and execution of clinical trials.\nGovernment Regulation\nFDA Review and Approval\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local levels, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any products we develop will require regulatory review and allowance to proceed prior to conducting clinical trials and additional regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, biopharmaceutical testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, and other promotional practices.\nObtaining FDA approval is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, FDA approval requires that preclinical studies be conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on efficacy and to identify any major safety concerns. The results of these studies are then submitted as a part of an IND, which the FDA must review and allow before human clinical trials can start. The IND includes a detailed description of the proposed clinical investigations. An independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) must also review and approve the clinical protocol and each clinical site.\nA company must submit an IND for each investigational medical product and specific indication(s) and must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA approval. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk is presented to participants including patients.\nObtaining FDA approval prior to marketing a biopharmaceutical product in the United States typically requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trials are the means by which experimental treatments are tested in humans and are conducted following preclinical testing. Clinical trials may be conducted within the United States or in foreign countries. If clinical trials are conducted in foreign countries, the products under development as well as the trials are subject to regulations of the FDA and/or its regulatory counterparts in the other countries. Upon successful completion of clinical trials, approval to market the treatment for a particular patient population may be requested from the FDA in the United States and/or its counterparts in other countries.\nClinical trials for therapeutic products are normally conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of subjects/patients to evaluate the safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In some special cases where the efficacy testing of a product may present a special challenge to testing in humans, such as in the case of a vaccine to protect healthy humans from a life-threatening disease that is not a naturally occurring threat, effectiveness testing may be required in animals. For certain advanced therapies that meet eligibility criteria for expedited program designations, clinical development may be accelerated.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the treatment/drug product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators who generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection, and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.\nFurther, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.\nAfter completion of clinical trials of a new product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained. If the product is regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, is required. If the product is classified as a new drug, a New Drug Application, or NDA is required. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development activities, preclinical studies, and clinical trials in addition to detailed chemistry, manufacturing and control information.\nApplications submitted to the FDA are subject to an unpredictable and potentially prolonged approval process. Despite good-faith communication and collaboration between the applicant and the FDA during the development process, the FDA may ultimately decide, upon final review of the data, that the application does not satisfy its criteria for approval or requires additional product development or further preclinical or clinical studies. Even if FDA regulatory approval(s) are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.\nBefore marketing approval can be secured for a product, the facility in which the product is manufactured must be inspected by the FDA and must comply with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. In addition, after marketing approval is secured, the manufacturing facility must be inspected periodically for cGMP compliance by FDA inspectors, and, if the facility is located in California, by inspectors from the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services.\nSponsors of clinical trials are required to register, and report results for, all controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase 1 investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation. Trial registration may require public disclosure of certain confidential commercial development data.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe FDA offers several programs to expedite the development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments.\nRMAT designation:\nA drug is eligible for designation as an RMAT if: the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under certain other sections; the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Some of our current and future products may be eligible for RMAT designation.\nOrphan designation:\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such product for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a product containing the same active moiety for the same use or indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Any claims of clinical superiority could require a head-to-head clinical trial between such drugs. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If a product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.\nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Regulations\nAlthough we currently do not have any products on the market, we may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, among other things, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of pharmaceutical and biological products are potentially subject to regulation and enforcement by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. Our current and future business activities, including for example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with health care regulatory laws, as applicable, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf the federal anti-kickback statute, which is a criminal statute that makes it a felony for individuals or entities to knowingly and willfully offer or pay, or to solicit or receive, direct or indirect remuneration, in order to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommending of items or services, or the referral of patients for services, that are reimbursed under a federal health care program, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds, with penalties that include three times the governments damages plus civil penalties for each false claim; in addition, the False Claims Act permits a person with knowledge of fraud, referred to as a qui tam plaintiff, to file a lawsuit on behalf of the government against the person or business that committed the fraud, and, if the action is successful, the qui tam plaintiff is rewarded with a percentage of the recovery;\n\u25cf federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical suppliers to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare professionals and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may impose stricter requirements than federal law and may apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor (including commercial insurers and cash-paying patients); state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare professionals and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare professionals or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional program integrity obligations, individual imprisonment, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, refusal to permit us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits, and future earnings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, and cash flows. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors.\nMoreover, the introduction of legislation, implementation of new regulations, or enforcement of existing regulations that have a negative impact on the commercial prospects for the types of products we are developing could negatively impact our share price and our ability to raise capital.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.\nIn the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payor coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product.\nMoreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved or that the product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution. There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for approved products, and reimbursement rates may fluctuate over time or vary according to the use of the product or clinical setting in which a product is used. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.\nFurther, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services, and there is increasing pressure on biotechnology companies to reduce healthcare costs. If purchasers or users of our products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the cost of using our products, they may forgo or reduce their use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and whether adequate third-party coverage will be available. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government funded and private payors for future products we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize potential products, and our overall financial condition.\nHealthcare Reform\nIn March 2010, former President Obama signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs; requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, proposing to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future.\nWe also are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of facilities, including those of our suppliers and manufacturers, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries as well as difficulties in manufacturing or continuing to develop our products, and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nEmployees\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had 12 full-time employees. In July 2022, the Company began to streamline the organization to focus around two of its therapies (oncology and HIV therapeutic vaccine). The Company has tailored its workforce to focus on these therapies. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.\nCorporate Information\nOn September 28, 2023, Renovaro Biosciences Inc., entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with GEDi Cube Intl Ltd., a private company formed under the laws of England and Wales (GEDi Cube). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Renovaro will acquire 100% of the equity interests of GEDi Cube from its equity holders (the Sellers) and GEDi Cube will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renovaro. On September 28, 2023, the board of directors of Renovaro, and the board of managers of GEDi Cube unanimously approved the Purchase Agreement. The completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Renovaro and GEDi Cube (See Note 11-Subsequent Events).\nThere can be no assurance that the Transaction will be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the possibility that shareholders of Renovaro may not approve the issuance of new shares of Renovaro common stock in the proposed Transaction; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed Transaction may not be satisfied, that either party may terminate the Transaction Agreement or that the closing of the proposed Transaction might be delayed or not occur at all.\nWe trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker RENB.\nOur website is http://www.renovarobio.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our internet site, our annual, quarterly, and current reports and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Information contained in our website is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this report.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our business, financial condition or operating results to be harmed. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this report in their entirety for additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties.\n\u00b7 We have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u00b7 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\n\u00b7 We will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.\n\u00b7 Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or restrict our operations.\n\u00b7 We are a pre-clinical biotechnology company and may never be able to successfully develop marketable products or generate any revenue. We have a very limited relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. There is no assurance that our future operations will result in profits. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues, we may suspend or cease operations.\n\u00b7 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations or disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur significant expenses, divert our managements attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\u00b7 Negative publicity has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business and may have a long-term effect on our relationships with our customers, partners and collaborators.\n\u00b7 The Transaction with Gedi Cube may not be completed and failure to complete the Transaction could negatively impact the price of our Common Stock and have other adverse effects.\n\u00b7 We are highly dependent on the services of third parties to conduct research and development of our pipeline, and our failure to maintain the services of such third parties could harm our business.\n\u00b7 The results of pre-clinical studies or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, and if we fail to demonstrate efficacy in our pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials in the future our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Our reliance on third parties, such as university laboratories, contract manufacturing organizations and contract or clinical research organizations, may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, non-clinical testing or clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them.\n\u00b7 We have limited experience in drug development and may not be able to successfully develop any drugs, which would cause us to cease operations.\n\u00b7 We have licensed a portion of our intellectual property from our licensors. If we breach any of our license agreements with these licensors, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully and to compete effectively may be adversely affected\n\u00b7 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be negatively impacted and our business would be harmed.\n\u00b7 Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\n\u00b7 Our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\n\u00b7 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\n\u00b7 Trading of our Common Stock may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our Common Stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\n\u00b7 Future sales and issuances of our Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\n\u00b7 We have limited corporate infrastructure and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\n\u00b7 We rely upon information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\n\u00b7 If serious adverse events or other undesirable side effects or safety concerns attributable to our product candidates occur, they may adversely affect or delay our clinical development and commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\n\u00b7 We have no manufacturing experience, and the failure to comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations and requirements could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nInvesting in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section of this report titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our Common Stock.\nThe risks described below may not be the only ones relating to our Company and additional risks that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect us. If any of these risks, including those described below, materialize, our business, competitive position, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects could be seriously harmed. In these circumstances, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and investors may lose all or a part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a pre-clinical-stage biotechnology company. Investment in biotechnology related to genetically modified cells is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to prove effective, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We do not have any products approved by regulatory authorities and have not generated any revenues from product sales or otherwise to date, and have incurred significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect to continue to incur such expenses. As a result, we have not been profitable and have incurred significant operating losses in every reporting period since our inception. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we reported a net loss of $39.7 million and $113.4 million. We had an accumulated deficit of $244.0 million and $204.3 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe do not expect to generate revenues for the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses to increase as we continue to research, develop, and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and any additional product candidates we may acquire, in-license or develop, and potentially begin to commercialize product candidates that may achieve regulatory approval. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. If any of our product candidates fails in clinical studies or does not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future as we continue to invest in research and development of our existing product candidates, investigate and potentially acquire new product candidates and expand our manufacturing and commercialization activities.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nOur consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 million and an accumulated deficit of $244.0 million. We do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient for the next twelve months. As a result of our financial condition and other factors described herein, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. We continue to analyze various alternatives, including potentially obtaining debt or equity financings or other arrangements. Our future success depends on our ability to raise capital. We cannot be certain that raising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If we issue additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our Common Stock, and our current shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our current development programs, cut operating costs, forgo future development and other opportunities, or even terminate our operations.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the pre-clinical development of our cell, gene and immunotherapy product candidates, and the advancement and potential expansion of our pre-clinical research pipeline. We also expect to continue to expend resources for the development and manufacturing of product candidates and the technology we have licensed or have a right to license from our licensors. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, potentially acquiring or licensing new product candidates or technologies, conducting pre-clinical and clinical studies and potentially obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing products, as well as marketing and selling products approved for sale, if any. Under the terms of certain of our license agreements, we are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We will also need to make significant expenditures to develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing, and distribution for any products, if any, that we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we choose to commercialize on our own. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the design and outcome of our ongoing, planned and anticipated pre-clinical and clinical studies is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the costs and payments associated with license agreements for our potential products and technologies;\n\u25cf the costs of conducting pre-clinical and clinical studies and the costs of manufacturing our product candidates\n\u25cf the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, if clinical studies are successful, including any costs from post-market requirements;\n\u25cf the cost of commercialization activities for our product candidates, if any of these product candidates is approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u25cf the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u25cf the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies, or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nUntil such time as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may attempt to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, government and/or other third-party grants or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our investors ownership interest will be diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more clinical research or development programs, which would adversely impact our potential revenues, future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a pre-clinical biotechnology company and may never be able to successfully develop marketable products or generate any revenue. We have a very limited relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. There is no assurance that our future operations will result in profits. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe are an early-stage biotechnology company and have not generated any revenues to date. All of our product candidates are in the discovery stage or pre-clinical development stage. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our research and development efforts will be successful or, if successful, that our potential treatments will ever be approved for sale to generate commercial revenues. Our pipeline includes cell, gene and immunotherapy involving genetically modified cells targeted to treat cancer, HIV, and Hepatitis B, and we rely on third parties under contract in the development of product candidates in our pipeline. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manage and fund the development of a pipeline with multiple target conditions, nor that third parties will meet their obligations to us in connection with our research and development. We and certain third parties, on which we rely, have no relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. We are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise, including, but not limited to, risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of treatments either in non-clinical testing or in clinical trials, failure to establish business relationships, failure of our third parties to meet their obligations to us and competitive disadvantages against larger and more established companies. If we fail to become profitable, we may suspend or cease operations.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory investigations or disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur significant expenses, divert our managements attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving intellectual property, privacy, securities, tax, labor and employment, and other matters that could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. Recently, we have seen a rise in the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries. The arrest and indictment of Serhat G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc, a co-founder of the Company, has, and could in the future, subject us to regulatory proceedings and litigation by governance agencies and private litigants brought against us, that regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees and other costs. Additionally, we have in the past been subject to intense media scrutiny, which exposes us to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.\nWe have also been named in several lawsuits related to Mr. G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc. For example, the Company and certain of its current and former officers have been named in securities class actions by purported stockholders of ours, alleging defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the Companys relationship with Mr. G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc and its commercial prospects. In addition, two stockholders filed stockholder derivative action lawsuits purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of our executive officers and the members of our Board of Directors alleging violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and also setting out claims for breach of fiduciary duty, contribution and indemnification, aiding and abetting, and gross mismanagement. Additionally, from time to time, we may be, and currently are, subject to inquiries from regulators in which they seek information about us. Such further inquiries could result in more formal investigations or allegations, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nLitigation, regulatory proceedings, such as the investigations described above, as well as the related class action claims and lawsuits, and securities matters that we are currently facing or could face, can be protracted and expensive, and have results that are difficult to predict. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages and include claims for injunctive relief. Additionally, our legal costs for any of these matters, either alone or in the aggregate, could be significant. Adverse outcomes with respect to any of these legal or regulatory proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments, penalties, and fines. Even if these proceedings are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and require significant expenditures. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the section titled Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe results of litigation, investigations, claims, and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining reserves for pending litigation and other legal and regulatory matters requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nNegative publicity has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business and may have a long-term effect on our relationships with our customers, partners and collaborators.\nOur business and reputation have been negatively affected by negative publicity resulting from the arrest and indictment of Serhat G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc, a co-founder of the Company and an inventor of some of the Companys intellectual property. If we are unable to rebuild the trust of our collaborators, research institutions and investors, and if further negative publicity continues, we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business. We have experienced claims and litigation as a consequence of these matters, including stockholder class actions in connection with a decline in our stock price and litigation with Mr. G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc. Related legal expenses of defending these claims have negatively impacted our operating results. Continuing higher legal fees, potential new claims, liabilities from existing cases and continuing negative publicity could continue to have a negative impact on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Transaction with Gedi Cube\nThe Transaction with Gedi Cube may not be completed and failure to complete the transaction could negatively impact the price of our Common Stock and have other adverse effects.\nOn September 28, 2023, the Company signed a Purchase Agreement to acquire Gedi Cube, a cutting-edge health AI company, in which the Company will acquire all the issued and outstanding stock of Gedi Cube. Completion of the transaction is subject to, among other matters, satisfaction of the closing conditions provided for in the Purchase Agreement and approval of the transaction by the Companys stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. If the Transaction is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of Renovaro may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Transaction, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the price of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from our customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, commercial collaborators and other business relationships;\n\u25cf we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the transaction, such as legal, accounting, investor relations and printing fees;\n\u25cf the Purchase Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of the business pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the Purchase Agreement, may have been pursued;\n\u25cf matters relating to the transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which may have resulted in the distraction of our management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates\nWe are highly dependent on the services of third parties to conduct research and development of our pipeline, and our failure to maintain the services of such third parties could harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on third parties working in conjunction with our officers, employees, scientific advisory board and research institutions in the research and development of product candidates in our pipeline. The loss of the services of any of the foregoing, or of any of our key employees or scientific advisory board members could impede the achievement of our research, development, regulatory approval, and commercialization objectives.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies or earlier clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, and if we fail to demonstrate efficacy in our pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials in the future our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our research and development efforts will depend upon our ability to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatments in our pipeline in pre-clinical studies, as well as in clinical trials following IND approval by the FDA. Pre-clinical studies involve testing potential product candidates in appropriate non-human disease models to demonstrate efficacy and safety.\nSuccess in pre-clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. Currently, several of our product candidates, including RENB-DC-11, our genetically-modified allogeneic dendritic therapeutic vaccination platform for solid tumors, RENB-HV-12, our therapeutic HIV vaccine, and RENB-HV-01, our autologous HIV curative treatment are all currently in various stages of pre-clinical development with ongoing and planned pre-clinical studies in conjunction with research institutions and third parties. Despite preliminary data we believe is positive, this does not guarantee that any of these products will proceed to the clinical stage or to approval for commercial use. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical studies, even after seeing promising results in earlier preclinical or clinical studies.\nRegulatory agencies evaluate non-clinical data carefully before they will approve clinical testing in humans. If certain non-clinical data reveals potential safety issues or the results are inconsistent with an expectation of the potential product candidates efficacy in humans, the regulatory agencies may require additional more rigorous testing before allowing human clinical trials. This additional testing will increase program expenses and extend timelines. We may decide to suspend further testing on our potential products or abandon the product lines altogether if, in the judgment of our management and advisors, the pre-clinical test results do not support further development, as we did with our pan-coronavirus and influenza product lines.\nOur novel gene, cell and immunotherapy product candidates and new therapeutic approaches could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny, delays in clinical development or delays in our inability to achieve regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur future success is dependent on the successful development of novel gene, cell and immunotherapy product candidates. Because these programs, particularly our pipeline of allogeneic T-cell product candidates that are bioengineered from healthy donor cells, represent a new approach to immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, developing and commercializing our product candidates subject us to a number of challenges.\nMoreover, actual or perceived safety issues, including adoption of new therapeutics or novel approaches to treatment, may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical studies, or if approved by applicable regulatory authorities, of physicians to subscribe to the novel treatment mechanics. The FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may ask for specific post-market requirements, and additional information informing benefits or risks of our products may emerge at any time prior to or after regulatory approval.\nWe face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully market or commercialize our product candidates.\nThe development of treatments in the fields of cancer, HIV, and Hepatitis B is highly competitive and many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations may pursue the research and development of technologies, drugs or other therapeutic products for the treatment of some or all of the diseases we are targeting. Nearly all of our competitors have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staffs and facilities, and a longer history in drug discovery and development, obtaining regulatory approval and pharmaceutical product manufacturing and marketing than we do. Techniques in gene, cell and immunotherapy are subject to rapid technological change and development and are significantly affected by existing rival products and medical procedures, new product introductions and the market activities of other participants. With additional resources, our competitors may be able to respond to rapid and significant technological changes faster than we can. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. We may also face competition from products, which have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of these same indications. If we are unable to compete effectively with any existing products, new treatment methods and new technologies, we may be unable to commercialize therapeutic products that we may develop in the future, which could adversely impact our potential revenues, results of operations and financial condition or lead to abandonment of product candidates in our pipeline.\nOur reliance on third parties, such as university laboratories, contract manufacturing organizations and contract or clinical research organizations, may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, non-clinical testing or clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them.\nIn the course of the development of our pipeline, we have and expect to continue to engage university laboratories, non-profit organizations, independent contractors, other biotechnology companies or clinical manufacturing organizations to conduct and manage research and development, pre-clinical and clinical studies and to manufacture materials for us to be used in pre-clinical and clinical testing. Due to engagements with these organizations, many important aspects of our research have been and will be out of our direct control. If any of these organizations we may engage in the future, fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform non-clinical testing and/or clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, we may face delays in completing our clinical trials, as well as commercialization of any of our product candidates. Furthermore, any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials, regulatory filings and the potential market approval of our product candidates.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of proposed legislative and regulatory changes related to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to profitably sell or commercialize our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the future. The potential pricing and reimbursement environment for our product candidates may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, policies advanced by the current or any new presidential administration, federal agencies, healthcare legislation passed by Congress, or fiscal challenges faced by all levels of government health administration authorities, or by similar changes in foreign countries. The implementation of any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including our share price and ability to raise capital.\nWe have limited experience in drug development and may not be able to successfully develop any drugs, which would cause us to cease operations.\nWe have never successfully developed a new drug and brought it to market. Our management and clinical teams have experience in drug development, but they may not be able to successfully develop any drugs. Our ability to achieve revenues and profitability in our business will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop products internally or to obtain rights to them from others on favorable terms; complete laboratory testing and human studies; obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products; successfully complete regulatory review to obtain requisite governmental agency approvals; enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf; and enter into arrangements with third parties to provide sales and marketing functions. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, we will be forced to cease operations.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nOur gene therapy product candidates are still in development and will require extensive clinical testing before we are prepared to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory authorities. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit any such application for regulatory approval for our product candidates or whether any such application will be approved by the applicable regulatory authority in our target markets. Human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For instance, regulatory authorities may not agree with our proposed endpoints for any clinical trials of our gene therapy product candidates, which may delay the commencement of our clinical trials.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve an uncertain outcome.\nOur product candidates are still in development and will require extensive clinical testing before we are prepared to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory authorities. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit any such application for regulatory approval of our product candidates or whether any such application will be approved by the applicable regulatory authority in our target markets. Human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For instance, regulatory authorities may not agree with our proposed endpoints for any clinical trials of our product candidates, which may delay the commencement of our clinical trials. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete.\nA number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials, and in the regulatory approval process. In addition, the design of a clinical trial, such as endpoints, inclusion and exclusion criteria, statistical analysis plans, data access protocols and trial sizing, can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues may be delayed. In addition, any delays in our clinical trials could increase our costs, cause a drop in our stock price, slow down the approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEnrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control.\nWe may encounter delays in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials, and even once enrolled we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the effectiveness of our patient recruitment efforts, delays in enrollment due to travel or quarantine policies, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study candidate, the perceived risks and benefits of gene therapy approaches for the treatment of certain diseases, the number and nature of competing existing treatments for our target indications, the number and nature of ongoing trials for other product candidates in development for our target indications, perceived risk of the delivery procedure, patients with pre-existing conditions that preclude their participation in any trial, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study. Furthermore, the results we have reported in clinical trials to date and any other results we may report in clinical trials of any of our gene therapy product candidates in the future may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials of those gene therapy product candidates. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their product candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment in our clinical trials. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our gene therapy product candidates or could render further development impossible. In addition, we expect to rely on clinical trial sites to ensure proper and timely conduct of our future clinical trials and, while we intend to enter into agreements governing their services, we will be limited in our ability to control their actual performance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe have licensed a portion of our intellectual property from our licensors. If we breach any of our license agreements with these licensors, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe hold rights under license agreements with our licensors that are important to our business. Our research and development platform is built, in part, around patent rights licensed from such licensors. Under our existing license agreements, we are subject to various obligations, including diligence obligations with respect to development and commercialization activities, provision of support with respect to development of licensed intellectual property, prosecution of intellectual property protection, payment obligations upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales. In spite of our efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If any of these licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of product candidates covered by any such licenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf payment obligations due to licensors under license agreements and other disputes related to the obligations for payment related to intellectual property protection;\n\u25cf the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of a licensor that is not subject to a licensing agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u25cf our diligence obligations under license agreements and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations.\nThe resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we do not obtain required intellectual property licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling products requiring these rights or licenses. There is also a risk that legal disputes may arise as to the rights to technology developed in collaboration with other parties, all with attendant risk, distraction, expense, and lack of predictability.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully and to compete effectively may be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements - either that we own or possess or that are owned or possessed by our licensors that are licensed to us - to protect the intellectual property related to our technology and product candidates. When we refer to our technologies, inventions, patents, provisional patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights, we are referring to both the rights that we own or possess as well as those that we license, many of which are critical to our intellectual property protection and our business. For example, the product candidates and platform technology we have licensed from our licensors are protected primarily by patent or patent applications of our licensors that we have licensed and as confidential know-how and trade secrets. If the intellectual property that we rely on is not adequately protected, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe patentability of inventions and the validity, enforceability and scope of patents in the biotechnology field is uncertain because it involves complex legal, scientific and factual considerations, and it has in recent years been the subject of significant litigation. Moreover, the standards applied by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and non-U.S. patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology patents.\nThere is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications is known to us or has been found in the instances where searching was done. We may be unaware of prior art that could be used to invalidate an issued patent or prevent a pending patent application from issuing as a patent. There also may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim of one of our patents or patent applications, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of such claim. We also may not be able to obtain full patent protection from provisional patents for which we have sought or will seek further patent protection. As a consequence of these and other factors, our patent applications may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the U.S. or in other countries.\nEven if patents have issued or do successfully issue from patent applications, and even if these patents cover our product candidates, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in these patents being narrowed, invalidated or held to be unenforceable. No assurance can be given that if challenged, our patents would be declared by a court to be valid or enforceable.\nEven if unchallenged, our patents and patent applications or other intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. The possibility exists that others will develop products on an independent basis which have the same effect as our product candidates and which do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights, or that others will design around the claims of patents that we have had issued that cover our product candidates. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could jeopardize our ability to commercialize our product candidates and dissuade companies from collaborating with us.\nWe may also desire to seek a license from a third party who owns intellectual property that may be useful for providing exclusivity for our product candidates, or for providing the ability to develop and commercialize a product candidate in an unrestricted manner. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain a license from such a third party on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nWe and our licensors have filed a number of patent applications covering our product candidates or methods of using or making those product candidates. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will be issued with respect to these pending patent applications, the breadth of any such patents that are ultimately issued or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Because patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate. We or our licensors may also become involved in proceedings regarding our patents, including patent infringement lawsuits, interference or derivation proceedings, oppositions, and inter partes and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO, the European Patent Office and other non-U.S. patent offices.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be negatively impacted and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents we hold rights to, we also rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our intellectual property. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with employees and certain consultants. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we might not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. Further, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to commercialize our product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of others. While some of the intellectual property utilized in our product candidates is owned, some is licensed from our licensors, who hold patents and provisional patents in their names. We have not conducted extensive freedom of use patent searches and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could be issued which would have an adverse effect on our ability to market our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our technology. We also cannot be sure that patents or provisional patents filed by others are valid or will be upheld if challenged. It is possible that there are additional patents that may cover certain other aspects of technology used in our product candidates that is not covered by our licensed intellectual property. If our licensed technology or other subject matter are claimed under other United States patents or other international patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we or our licensors may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in a challenge or be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to succeed in a challenge, develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain needed licenses could have significant adverse consequences to the development of our pipeline. Adverse consequences include delays in marketing some or all of our product candidates based on our technology or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses. If we defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease the research and development of our technology.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Additionally, parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future. From September 29, 2022 through September 29, 2023, the reported sale price of our Common Stock has fluctuated between $4.47 and $0.40 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our Common Stock. The market price of our Common Stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf negative publicity;\n\u25cf our compliance with Nasdaq rules and regulations;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf regulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or products or our competitors product candidates or products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf results of clinical studies of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf sales of our Common Stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf the other risks described in this Risk Factors section.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nA significant portion of our Common Stock is held in restricted form, and consequentially a minority of our outstanding Common Stock actively trades in the public markets. Sales of a substantial number of such shares of our Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. While a large majority of such shares are unregistered and subject to volume restrictions on sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, these restrictions could be lifted if any of our stockholders ceased to be bound by such restrictions. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. As a Smaller Reporting Company and Non-accelerated Filer, we are able to take advantage of certain accommodations afforded to such companies, including being exempt from the requirement to conduct an audit of our internal controls. In the event we no longer qualify as a Smaller Reporting Company and Non-accelerated Filer, we will lose such accommodations, which could involve significant costs that could affect our operations. Changes in reporting requirements, the current political environment and the potential for future regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to public companies have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. To the extent these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of potential gain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner, we determine from time to time. These future issuances of Common Stock or Common Stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, and any additional shares that may be issued in connection with acquisitions or licenses, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our Compensation Committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. Future grants of RSUs, options and other equity awards and issuances of Common Stock under our equity incentive plans will result in dilution and may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nSome terms of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, and our Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These include terms that:\n\u25cf permit our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences, and privileges as they may designate;\n\u25cf provide that all vacancies on our Board of Directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u25cf provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders notice; and\n\u25cf do not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election.\nAny of the factors listed above may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Any term of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Common Stock.\nRisks Related To Our Business Operations and Managing Growth\nIf our operations require a full time Chief Medical Officer (CMO), and we are not able to hire a full time CMO to manage our clinical operations or if our current Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operating Officer (COO) or key scientific personnel cease to serve, our business will be harmed.\nCurrently, our management team is led by Dr. Mark Dybul, the Chief Executive Officer, Luisa Puche, our Chief Financial Officer, and Francois Binette, our Chief Operating Officer. If Dr. Dybul, Ms. Puche or Mr. Binette should cease to serve, our business operations may suffer. Additionally, we may in the future require a Chief Medical Officer, and if we are unable to hire a full-time CMO, our business operations and the continued development of our product candidates may suffer.\nIn addition, we are dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified additional management and scientific personnel. If we are not able to retain our management and to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we might not be able to sustain our operations or grow.\nWe have limited corporate infrastructure and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had 12 full time employees and we rely on third-party contractors for the provision of professional, scientific, regulatory, and other services. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we may need additional managerial, scientific, operational, financial, and other resources. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day operations and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We might not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational inefficiencies, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our current and potential future product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected and our ability to generate and grow revenue could be reduced and we might not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance, our ability to commercialize product candidates, develop a scalable infrastructure and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nIf we, our service providers, or third parties fail to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nIf we, our service providers, or any third parties engaged in the development of our product candidates fail to comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment, health and animal and human safety, we could be subject to enforcement actions and our business prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development activities, and the research and development activities of our service providers and any third parties engaged in development of our product candidates, may involve the use of hazardous materials and chemicals or other regulated activities. In conjunction with our service providers and other third parties, we are also engaged in pre-clinical studies using live animals and samples of infectious diseases. Failure to adequately handle and dispose of hazardous materials or to meet various standards imposed by federal, state, local or foreign regulators could lead to liabilities for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We also may be subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials.\nIf we, our service providers, or any third parties engaged in development of our product candidates fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our ability to develop, market and sell our product candidates successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our product candidates. These enforcement actions may include:\n\u25cf restrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our product candidates;\n\u25cf restrictions on importation of our product candidates;\n\u25cf suspension of review or refusal to approve new or pending applications;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of product approvals;\n\u25cf product seizures;\n\u25cf injunctions; and\n\u25cf civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nWe rely upon information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nOur business operations could suffer in the event of system failure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contract research organizations, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of formulas or data from completed or ongoing or planned pre-clinical studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur business plan may lead to the initiation of one or more product development programs, the discontinuation of one or more development programs, or the execution of one or more transactions that you do not agree with or that you do not perceive as favorable to your investment in our Common Stock.\nWe are pursuing a strategy to leverage our clinical experience and expertise for the clinical development and regulatory approval of our gene therapy product candidates. As part of our ongoing business strategy, we continue to explore potential opportunities to acquire or license new product candidates and to collaborate on our existing products in development. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be successfully developed, or that the early clinical trial results of these product candidates will be predictive of future clinical trial results. During 2022, we decided to abandon our pan-coronavirus and influenza pipelines as the results did not support further development. We again may determine at any time that one or more of our in-licensed product candidates is not suitable for continued development due to cost, feasibility of obtaining regulatory approvals or any other reason, and may terminate the related license.\nOur business plan requires us to be successful in a number of challenging, uncertain and risky activities, including pursuing development of our gene therapy product candidates in indications for which we have limited or no human clinical data, designing and executing a nonclinical and/or clinical development program for our product candidates, building internal or outsourced gene therapy capabilities, converting early stage gene therapy research efforts into clinical development opportunities, identifying additional promising new assets for development that are available for acquisition or in-license and that fit our strategic focus and identifying potential partners to collaborate on our products. We may not be successful at one or more of the activities required for us to execute this business plan. In addition, we may consider other strategic alternatives, such as mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, partnerships and collaborations. We cannot be sure when or if any type of transaction will result. Even if we pursue a transaction, such transaction may not be consistent with our stockholders expectations or may not ultimately be favorable for our stockholders, either in the shorter or longer term.\nThere can be no assurance that the Transaction will be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the possibility that shareholders of Renovaro may not approve the issuance of new shares of Renovaro common stock in the proposed Transaction or that shareholders of Renovaro may not approve the proposed Transaction; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed Transaction may not be satisfied, that either party may terminate the Transaction Agreement or that the closing of the proposed Transaction might be delayed or not occur at all.\nOur growth prospects and the future value of our Company are primarily dependent on the progress of our ongoing and planned development programs for our product candidates as well as the outcome of our ongoing business development efforts and pipeline progression, together with the amount of our remaining available cash. The development of our product candidates and the outcome of our ongoing business development efforts and pipeline are highly uncertain. We expect to continue to reassess and make changes to our existing development programs and pipeline strategy. Our plans for our development programs may be affected by the results of competitors clinical trials of product candidates addressing our current target indications, and our business development efforts and pipeline progression may also be affected by the results of competitors ongoing research and development efforts. We may modify, expand or terminate some or all of our development programs, clinical trials or collaborative research programs at any time as a result of new competitive information or as the result of changes to our product pipeline or business development strategy.\nIf serious adverse events or other undesirable side effects or safety concerns attributable to our product candidates occur, they may adversely affect or delay our clinical development and commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.\nUndesirable side effects or safety concerns caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt our clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval. If treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or other undesirable side effects or safety concerns, or unexpected characteristics attributable to our product candidates are observed in any future clinical trials, they may adversely affect or delay our clinical development and commercialization of the effected product candidate, and the occurrence of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial prospects. Results of our future clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or other regulatory agency could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects or safety concerns caused by these product candidates, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw, suspend, or limit approvals of such products and require us to take them off the market;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, or that we implement a REMS or REMS-like plan to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way a product is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or change the labeling of a product;\n\u25cf we may be required to conduct additional post-marketing studies or surveillance;\n\u25cf we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;\n\u25cf sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u25cf we may be subject to regulatory investigations,\n\u25cf we may be subject to government enforcement actions, litigation, or product liability claims; and\n\u25cf our products may become less competitive, or our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or any collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our product candidates.\nWe have no manufacturing experience, and the failure to comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations and requirements could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe have never manufactured products in the highly regulated environment of pharmaceutical manufacturing, and our team has limited experience in the manufacture of drug therapies. There are numerous regulations and requirements that must be maintained to obtain licensure and permitting required prior to the commencement of manufacturing, as well as additional requirements to continue manufacturing pharmaceutical products. In addition, we do not have the resources at this time to acquire or lease suitable facilities. If we or our CMO fail to comply with regulations, to obtain the necessary licenses and knowhow or to obtain the requisite financing in order to comply with all applicable regulations and to contract with, own or lease the required facilities in order to manufacture our products, we could be forced to cease operations, which would cause you to lose all of your investment in our Common Stock.\nIn addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that product candidates and drug products be manufactured according to cGMP. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP could lead to a shortage of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approval, if granted to us, and for other regulatory enforcement action, including Warning Letters, product seizure, injunction or other civil or criminal penalties.\nProduct candidates that we develop may have to compete with other products and product candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If we need to find another source of drug substance or drug product manufacturing for our product candidates, we may not be able to identify, or reach agreement with, commercial-scale manufacturers on commercially reasonably terms, or at all. If third parties that we engage in the future to manufacture a product for commercial sale or for our clinical trials, should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience significant delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of product for us to meet commercial demand or to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers. If for any reason we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of any product candidate that we develop, or the drug substances used to manufacture it, it will be more difficult for us to compete effectively, generate revenue, and further develop our products. In addition, if we are unable to assure a sufficient quantity of the drug for patients with rare diseases or conditions, we may lose any FDA Orphan Drug designation to which the product otherwise would be entitled.\nWe may, in the future, choose to seek FDA Orphan Drug designation for one or more of our current or future product candidates. Even if we obtain Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for a product candidate, there are limitations to the exclusivity afforded by such designation.\nIn the U.S., the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in very limited circumstances, including when the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines same drug as a drug that contains the same active moiety and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. To obtain Orphan Drug status for a drug that shares the same active moiety as an already approved drug, it must be demonstrated to the FDA that the drug is safer or more effective than the approved orphan designated drug, or that it makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition or if another drug with the same active moiety is determined to be safer, more effective, or represents a major contribution to patient care.\n1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nThe Company currently leases the following properties:\nLocation\nUse\nTerms\n2080 Century Park East, Suite 906\nLos Angeles, CA 90067\nHeadquarters\nThe Company entered into a Lease Agreement on June 19, 2018 for our corporate headquarters located at Century City Medical Plaza. We have a ten-year lease that was for approximately 2,453 square feet at this location. In February 2019, we extended our corporate headquarters to encompass the adjoining suite for approximately 1,101 square feet, bringing the total workspace to 3,554 square feet. The new base rent for this leased premises increases by 3% each year over the term, and ranges from $17,770 per month as of the date of the amendment until the end of the first year to $23,186 per month for the tenth year. The additional suite was in the form of an amendment to the original lease and will expire on the same date as the original lease. The Company was entitled to a total of $148,168 in contributions toward tenant improvements for both spaces. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nSecurities Class Action Litigation. On July 26, 2022 and July 28, 2022, securities class action complaints (the former, the Chow Action and the latter, the Manici Action) were filed by purported stockholders of ours in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The complaints allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in connection with the Companys relationship with Serhat G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc and its commercial prospects. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On November 22, 2022, the Manici Action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, but the Chow action remains pending. The defendants did not respond to the complaint in the Manici action and have not yet responded to the complaint in the Chow action. The Company intends to contest this matter but expresses no opinion as to the likelihood of a favorable outcome.\nFederal Derivative Litigation. On September 22, 2022, Samuel E. Koenig filed a shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On January 19, 2023, John Solak filed a substantially similar shareholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Both derivative actions recite similar underlying facts as those alleged in the Securities Class Action Litigation. The actions, filed on behalf of the Company, name Serhat G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc and certain of the Companys current and former directors as defendants. The actions also name the Company as a nominal defendant. The actions allege violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and also set out claims for breach of fiduciary duty, contribution and indemnification, aiding and abetting, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiffs do not quantify any alleged injury, but seek damages, disgorgement, restitution, and other costs and expenses. On January 24, 2023, the United States District Court for the Central District of California stayed the Koenig matter pending resolution of the defendants anticipated motion to dismiss in the Securities Class Action Litigation. On April 6, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware stayed the Solak matter pending resolution of the defendants anticipated motion to dismiss in the Securities Class Action Litigation. The defendants have not yet responded to either complaint. The Company intends to contest these matters but expresses no opinion as to the likelihood of favorable outcomes.\nState Derivative Litigation. On October 20, 2022, Susan Midler filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, reciting similar underlying facts as those alleged in the Securities Class Action Litigation. The action, filed on behalf of the Company, names Serhat G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc and certain of the Companys current and former directors as defendants. The action also names the Company as a nominal defendant. The action sets out claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, contribution and indemnification, aiding and abetting, and gross mismanagement. Plaintiff does not quantify any alleged injury, but seeks damages, disgorgement, restitution, and other costs and expenses. On January 20, 2023, the Court stayed the Midler matter pending resolution of the defendants anticipated motion to dismiss in the Securities Class Action Litigation. The Court also set a status conference for November 6, 2023. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint. The Company intends to contest this matter but expresses no opinion as to the likelihood of a favorable outcome.\nOn October 21, 2022, the Company filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against Serhat G\u00fcmr\u00fckc\u00fc, William Anderson Wittekind (Wittekind), G-Tech, SG&AW Holdings LLC, and SRI. The Complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a concerted, deliberate scheme to alter, falsify, and misrepresent to the Company the results of multiple studies supporting its Hepatitis B and SARS-CoV-2/influenza pipelines. Specifically, Defendants manipulated negative results to reflect positive outcomes from various studies, and even fabricated studies out of whole cloth. As a result of the defendants conduct, the Company claims that it paid approximately $25 million to Defendants and third-parties that it would not otherwise have paid. On April 21, 2023, defendants Wittekind, G-Tech, SG&AW Holdings LLC, and SRI filed a demurrer with respect to some, but not all, of the Companys claims, as well as a motion to strike. On September 6, 2023, the court denied in part and granted in part the pending motions. On September 7, 2023, the court entered a Case Management Order setting the Final Status Conference, trial, and other intervening deadlines. We will continue to pursue our claims against these defendants.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, Robert Wolfe and his company, Crossfield, Inc., filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont against the Company, Renovaro BioSciences Denmark ApS, and certain directors and officers. In the Complaint, Mr. Wolfe and Crossfield, Inc. asserted claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution, alleging, inter alia, that the Company lacked probable cause to file and prosecute an earlier action, and sought millions of dollars of compensatory damages, as well as punitive damages. The allegations in the Complaint relate to an earlier action filed by the Company and Renovaro BioSciences Denmark ApS in the Vermont Superior Court, Orange Civil Division. On March 3, 2022, the court partially granted the Companys motion to dismiss, dismissing the abuse of process claim against all defendants and all claims against Mark Dybul and Henrik Gr\u00f8nfeldt-S\u00f8rensen. On November 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the sole remaining claim of malicious prosecution. On August 24, 2023, the court denied the motion for summary judgment. On September 7, 2023, the Company moved for reconsideration of the courts order. The Company denies the allegations set forth in the Complaint and will continue to vigorously defend against the remaining claim.\nOn June 7, 2023, Weird Science LLC (Weird Science), Wittekind, the William Anderson Wittekind 2020 Annuity Trust, the William Anderson Wittekind 2021 Annuity Trust, the Dybul 2020 Angel Annuity Trust, and the Ty Mabry 2021 Annuity Trust (collectively, the Trusts) (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed a Verified Complaint against the Company in the Court of Chancery of Delaware. Plaintiffs allege that the Company breached the February 16, 2018 Investor Rights Agreement between the Company, Weird Science, and RS Group ApS (the Investor Rights Agreement). According to the Verified Complaint, the Investor Rights Agreement required the Company to (i) notify all Holders of Registrable Securities at least 30 days prior to filing a registration statement and (ii) afford such Holders an opportunity to have their Registrable Securities included in such registration statement. Plaintiffs allege that the Company breached these registration rights by failing to provide the required notice in connection with S-3 registration statements filed by the Company on July 13, 2020 and February 11, 2022. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys fees. The Company denies Plaintiffs allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claim.\nOn August 24, 2023, counsel on behalf of Weird Science, Wittekind, individually, and Wittekind, as trustee of the Trusts served a demand to inspect the Companys books and records (the Demand) pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law, \u00a7 220 (Section 220). The Demand seeks the Companys books and records in connection with a various issues identified in the Demand. The Company takes its obligations under Section 220 seriously and, to the extent that the requests are proper under Section 220, intends to comply with those obligations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information and Holders of our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol RENB.\nAs of September 29, 2023, the Company had 65,698,144 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and approximately 194 stockholders of record. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park), which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company may sell to Lincoln Park up to Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) of shares of its Common Stock over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which it agreed to provide Lincoln Park with certain registration rights related to the shares issued under the Purchase Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). On June 20, 2023, we issued 696,021 shares of Common Stock (the Commitment Shares) to Lincoln Park as a fee for its commitment to purchase shares of our Common Stock under the Purchase Agreement.\nThe issuance and sale of the Commitment Shares was made in reliance upon the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.\nNo other shares were issued in the fourth quarter that were not previously included in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nCompany Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nDividends\nThe Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its Common Stock and does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividend in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of the Board and will depend on the Companys earnings, if any, its capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors as the Board may consider. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition to the historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOur Business\nRenovaro BioSciences Inc. is a biotechnology company committed to developing advanced allogeneic cell and gene therapies to promote stronger immune system responses potentially for long-term or life-long cancer remission in some of the deadliest cancers, and potentially to treat or cure serious infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\nTo date, our operations have been funded by sales of our securities and debt financing. We have never generated any sales revenue and we expect this to continue until our therapies or products are approved for marketing in the United States and/or Europe. Even if we are successful in having our therapies or products approved for sale in the United States and/or Europe, we cannot guarantee that a market for the therapies or products will develop. We may never be profitable.\nRecent Developments\nDefinitive Agreement with GEDi Cube\nOn September 28, 2023, Renovaro Biosciences Inc., entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with GEDi Cube Intl Ltd., a private company formed under the laws of England and Wales (GEDi Cube). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Renovaro will acquire 100% of the equity interests of GEDi Cube from its equity holders (the Sellers) and GEDi Cube will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renovaro. On September 28, 2023, the board of directors of Renovaro, and the board of managers of GEDi Cube unanimously approved the Purchase Agreement. The completion of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Renovaro and GEDi Cube (See Note 11-Subsequent Events).\nAugust 2023 Private Placement\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company closed a private placement of 280,505 units,(the Units), each such Unit consists of (i) one share of the Companys Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share and (ii) one common stock purchase warrant to purchase five shares of the Companys common stock, $0.0001 par value per share at a price per Unit equal to $7.13 for aggregate proceeds to the Company of $2,000,000 in cash. In addition, the Company issued 280,505 Units in connection with the conversion of $2,000,000 of promissory note, as further described below under the heading Amendment and Conversion of Previously Issued Promissory Note.\nIn connection with the Private Placement, the Company sold an aggregate of 561,010 shares of Preferred Stock, which are initially convertible into an aggregate of 5,610,100 shares of Common Stock. In connection with the Private Placement, the Company sold Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,805,050 shares of Common Stock, which represents 50% warrant coverage. The Warrants are exercisable for five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $0.65 per share, payable in cash.\nAmendment and Conversion of Previously Issued Promissory Note\nOn July 31, 2023, the Company and the holder of the Previously Issued Promissory Note agreed to amend the Promissory Note (the Fourth Amendment), to provide the holder with limited conversion rights in connection with the Private Placement (the Conversion Right). Per the terms of the Fourth Amendment, the Holder could elect to convert $2,000,000 of the outstanding principal balance of the Promissory Note into the Units being offered in the Private Placement at the price per Unit being paid by the investors in the Private Placement.\nAs mentioned above, on August 1, 2023, Paseco ApS, the holder of a $5,000,000 promissory note issued by the Company, (the Promissory Note) notified the Company of its election to exercise the Conversion Right. Therefore, $2,000,000 of the outstanding principal balance of the note was converted into 280,505 Units, comprised of an aggregate of (i) 280,505 shares of Preferred Stock and (ii) Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,402,525 shares of Common Stock. A principal balance of $3,000,000 remained outstanding under the Promissory Note after the foregoing conversion. The Units issued in connection with the conversion were issued pursuant to Regulation S.\nGoing Concern and Managements Plans\nThe financial statements included elsewhere herein for the year ended June 30, 2023, were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities during the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,874,480, an accumulated deficit of $244,029,253, and total liabilities of $11,798,685. We have incurred losses from continuing operations, have used cash in our continuing operations, and are dependent on additional financing to fund operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements included elsewhere herein do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement has reduced overhead and administrative costs by streamlining the organization to focus around two of its therapies (oncology and HIV therapeutic vaccine) in order to reduce operating costs. The Company has also tailored its workforce to focus on these therapies. Management intends to try to convert its debt to equity. The Company intends to attempt to secure additional required funding through equity or debt financing (see Recent Developments for most recent funding). However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any sources of funding. Such additional funding may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms, and, in the case of equity financing transactions, could result in significant additional dilution to our stockholders. If we do not obtain required additional equity or debt funding, our cash resources will be depleted and we could be required to materially reduce or suspend operations, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that could result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us.\nFunding that we may receive during fiscal 2024 is expected to be used to satisfy existing and future obligations and liabilities and working capital needs, to support commercialization of our products and conduct the clinical and regulatory work to develop our product candidates, and to begin building working capital reserves.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues, expenses and net income for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The financial information below is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nFor the Years Ended\nJune 30, Increase/(Decrease)\n$ %\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative $ 15,318,198 $ 14,329,801 988,397 7 %\nResearch and development 4,165,197 8,372,800 (4,207,603 ) (50 )%\nIndefinite life intangible assets impairment charge 18,960,000 93,253,000 (74,293,000 ) (80 )%\nDepreciation and amortization 113,496 123,590 (10,094 ) (8 )%\nTotal Operating Expenses 38,556,891 116,079,191 (77,522,300 ) (67 )%\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS (38,556,891 ) (116,079,191 ) 77,522,300 (67 )%\nOther Income (Expenses)\nLoss on extinguishment of contingent consideration liability (419,182 ) - (419,182 ) 100 %\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration - 2,896,627 (2,896,627 ) (100 )%\nInterest expense (580,344 ) (372,844 ) (207,500 ) 56 %\nGain (loss) on currency transactions (1,019 ) (1,028 ) (11,422 )%\nInterest and other income (126,620 ) 122,041 (248,661 ) (204 )%\nTotal Other Income (Expenses) (1,127,165 ) 2,645,833 (3,772,998 ) (143 )%\nLoss Before Income Taxes (39,684,056 ) (113,433,358 ) 73,749,302 (65 )%\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit - (34 ) (100 )%\nNET LOSS $ (39,684,056 ) $ (113,433,392 ) 73,749,336 (65 )%\nFor the Years Ended\nJune 30, Increase/(Decrease)\n$ %\nNet Loss $ (39,684,056 ) $ (113,433,392 ) $ 73,749,336 (65 )%\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nForeign Currency Translation, net of taxes (19,602 ) 20,156 (103 )%\nOther Comprehensive Loss $ (39,683,502 ) $ (113,452,994 ) $ 73,769,492 (65 )%\nRevenues\nWe are a pre-clinical stage pre-revenue biotechnology company. We have never generated revenues and have incurred losses since inception. We do not anticipate earning any revenues until our therapies or products are approved for marketing and sale.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $38,556,891 and $116,079,191, respectively, representing a decrease of $77,522,300 or 67%. The largest contributors to the decrease in operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023, were the decrease in the non-cash intangible asset impairment of $74,293,000 (see Note 4 to the Financial Statements) and the decrease in research and development expenses of $4,207,603 partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses of $988,397 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, were $15,318,198 and $14,329,801, respectively, representing an increase of $988,397, or 7%. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily related to increases of $2,738,140 in legal fees, $865,911 in salaries and related costs, $566,448 in accounting fees and $302,130 in insurance costs, partially offset by the decrease of $1,847,551 in stock-based compensation, $495,000 in security costs, $363,984 in recruiting expenses, $153,541 in corporate fees and $116,648 in travel expenses.\nResearch and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, were $4,165,197 and $8,372,800, respectively, representing a decrease of $4,207,603 or 50%. The decrease in research and development expenses is primarily related to $3,261,500 in fees related to a collaborating partner that was incurred in the prior year in addition to costs with CDMO and CRO partners totaling $766,495 in the prior year.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nNet other income (expenses) for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $(1,127,165) and 2,645,833, respectively, representing a decrease of $3,772,998 or 143%. The decrease in other income was due primarily to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the amount of $2,896,627, which resulted from the mark to market adjustment on the remaining contingent consideration liability and the contingent shares issued during the prior year, in addition to the loss on extinguishment of contingent consideration liability of $419,182 in the year ended June 30, 2023.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was $39,684,056 and $113,433,392, respectively, representing a decrease in net loss of $73,749,336 or 65%. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the decrease of non-cash intangible asset impairment of $74,293,000, the decrease in research and development costs of $4,207,603 and the decrease in the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2,896,627 partially offset by the $988,397 increase in general and administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements through funding from stockholders, the sale of our Common Stock and warrants, and debt financing. We have never generated any sales revenue to support our operations and we expect this to continue until our therapies or products are approved for marketing in the United States and/or Europe. Even if we are successful in having our therapies or products approved for sale in the United States and/or Europe, we cannot guarantee that a market for the therapies or products will develop. We may never be profitable.\nAs noted above under the heading Going Concern and Managements Plans, through June 30, 2023, we have incurred substantial losses. We may need additional funds for (a) research and development, (b) increases in personnel, and (c) the purchase of equipment, specifically to advance towards an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) following Pre-IND readouts from the FDA for RENB-DC-11, RENB-HV-12, RENB-HV-01, RENB-HV-21 and RENB-HB-01. The availability of any required additional funding cannot be assured. In addition, an adverse outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings in which we are currently involved or in the future may be involved could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of our equity or debt securities. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had $1,874,480 in cash and working capital of $(8,457,693) as compared to $9,172,142 in cash and working capital of $3,114,170 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease in cash of $7,297,662 is primarily due to the cost of operations of $11,774,549, partially offset by funding totaling $4,515,056 related to private placements, and the exercise of warrants and options during the period.\nEquity\nOn July 8, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (the 2020 Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, (LPC), pursuant to which LPC is committed to buy, and we had the right, but not the obligation, to sell to LPC up to an aggregate of $20,000,000 of our Common Stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement, including a limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock we can put to LPC and the pricing parameters for the sales. In consideration for entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement, we issued 139,567 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee on July 21, 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company issued 497,340 shares of Common Stock for proceeds of $4,676,399 (see Note 8 of the Financial Statements.) As of October 17, 2022, we no longer have access to this Purchase Agreement.\nOn June 20, 2023, we entered into a purchase agreement (the 2023 Purchase Agreement) with LPC, pursuant to which the Company may sell and issue to LPC, and LPC is obligated to purchase, up to $20,000,000 of shares of our Common Stock over the 36-month term of the purchase agreement (see Note 8 of the Financial Statements).\nPursuant to a private placement offering in March 2023, the Company issued 2,378,070 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 1,189,036 shares of Common Stock (Purchase Warrants) resulting in proceeds of $2,711,0000 in a private placement offering. The Company effected the issuances of the shares of Common Stock from March 13, 2023 to March 29, 2023. The Purchase Warrants were immediately exercisable and had an exercise term of five years with an exercise price of $1.14 per share. The combined purchase price for one share of Common Stock and one Purchase Warrant was $1.14 per share. The private placement was made directly by the Company to persons who are not U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. No underwriter or placement agent was engaged by the Company for this private placement (see Note 8 of the Financial Statements).\nPursuant to a private placement offering, on June 26, 2023, the Company issued 4,718,532 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase 2,359,266 shares of Common Stock resulting in proceeds of $1,300,823 in a private placement offering and a reduction of notes payable of $1,200,000. The warrants were immediately exercisable and had an exercise term of five years with an exercise price of $0.53 per share. The combined purchase price for one share of Common Stock and one warrant was $0.53 per share. The private placement was made directly by the Company to persons who are not U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. No underwriter or placement agent was engaged by the Company for this private placement (see Note 8 of the Financial Statements).\nWarrant Exercises\nOn December 24, 2021, certain of our warrant holders exercised warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Common Stock for total proceeds to the Company of $130,000. On July 14, 2022, certain of our warrant holders exercised warrants to purchase 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock for total proceeds to the Company of $1,625,000 (see Note 8 to the Financial Statements).\nDebt\nOn February 6, 2020, the Company issued two Convertible Notes (the Convertible Notes) to Paseco APS (the Holder), a Danish limited company and an existing stockholder of the Company each with a face value amount of $600,000, convertible into shares of Common Stock. The Holder did not exercise the conversion feature that expired on February 6, 2021. The outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes was due and payable on February 6, 2023. Interest on the Convertible Notes commenced accruing on the date of issuance at six percent (6%) per annum, computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months, and was compounded monthly on the final day of each calendar month based upon the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest outstanding as of such compound date. The interest was payable in cash on a semi-annual basis. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the interest expense amounted to $210,543 and $72,875, respectively. Effective December 30, 2022, Company amended and restated the Convertible Notes (the Amended and Restated Secured Notes). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Secured Notes, the due date was extended to February 28, 2024, and the interest was increased to twelve percent (12%) per annum, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the date of amendment through the issuance of 198,439 shares of the Companys Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date, of $1.03, which included 29,419 shares for interest accrued through December 30, 2022, and the obligations of the Company under the Amended and Restated Secured Notes were secured by a security Agreement (the Security Agreement). On June 26, 2023, the holder of the Amended and Restated Secured Notes notified the Company that they wished to elect to exercise their conversion right triggered by a private placement. Therefore, the entire balance of $1,200,000 Amended and Restated Secured Notes were converted into 2,264,150 shares of Common Stock and 1,132,075 Warrants. There were no Amended and Restated Secured Notes outstanding as of June 30, 2023 (see Note 6 to the Financial Statements).\nOn March 30, 2020 (the Issuance Date), the Company issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $5,000,000 to Paseco ApS (the Holder). The principal amount of the Promissory Note was payable on November 30, 2021, and bore interest at a fixed rate of 6% per annum, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the date of issuance through the issuance of 188,485 shares of the Companys Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date, valued at $501,370. On February 11, 2021, the Company and the Holder amended the original Promissory Note to extend the maturity date to November 30, 2022. The Company prepaid in full all accrued interest from November 30, 2021 to the new maturity date November 30, 2022, through the issuance of 74,054 shares of Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date, valued at $299,178. On May 17, 2022, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Promissory Note that extended the maturity date out to November 30, 2023 and increased the interest rate from 6% to 12% per annum. The Company prepaid six months of interest through May 31, 2023, through issuance of 47,115 shares of Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date, valued at $299,178. All other terms of the Promissory Note remained the same. Effective December 30, 2022, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Promissory Note. Pursuant to the third amendment, the Companys obligations under the Promissory Note were secured by the Security Agreement. All accrued interest payable from May 30, 2023 to the maturity date was payable on May 30, 2023 in either cash or shares of our Common Stock. The Holder elected the interest be paid in cash (the Interest Payment).(see Note 6 to the Financial Statements.)\nTo secure the Companys obligations under each of the Amended and Restated Secured Notes and the Promissory Note, the Company entered into a Security Agreement with the Holder, pursuant to which the Company granted a lien on all assets of the Company (the Collateral) for the benefit of the Holder. Upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended and Restated Secured Notes and Promissory Note, respectively) the Holder may, among other things, collect or take possession of the Collateral, proceed with the foreclosure of the security interest in the Collateral or sell, lease or dispose of the Collateral.\nOn June 12, 2023, the Holder notified the Company that it wanted to apply the Interest Payment due to it towards the Companys next private placement. On June 26, 2023, the Holder participated in a private placement. As part of the private placement, the Company issued (i) 567,588 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and (ii) 283,794 Common Stock purchase warrants, at a purchase price of $0.53 per share, for aggregate purchase price of $300,822, equal to the Interest Payment (see Note 6 to the Financial Statements).\nCash Flows\nYear ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30,\nFollowing is a summary of the Companys cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:\nFor the Years Ended\nJune 30,\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (11,774,549 ) $ (15,732,336 )\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities (29,774 ) (5,156 )\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities 4,515,056 4,250,464\nEffect of exchange rates on cash (8,395 ) (5,240 )\nNet (Decrease) in Cash $ (7,297,662 ) $ (11,492,268 )\nAt June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,874,480, a decrease of $7,297,662, when compared to the June 30, 2022 balance of $9,172,142. This decrease was primarily due to cash used in operating activities, partially offset by cash provided by financing activities.\nWe plan to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund research and development, specifically to open an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) following Pre-IND readouts from the FDA (the first step in the drug review process by the FDA) for RENB-DC-11, RENB-HV-12, RENB-HV-01, RENB-HV-21 and RENB-HB-01. These activities will require an increase in selling, general and administrative costs, and research and development costs to support the expected growth. As additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of our equity or debt securities.\nCash used in operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $11,774,549 and $15,732,336, respectively, representing a decrease of $3,957,787. The decrease is primarily related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $4,305,157.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $29,774 and $5,156, respectively, representing an increase of $24,618. The increase is primarily due to purchases of equipment in the current year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $4,515,056 and $4,250,464, respectively, representing an increase of $264,592. The net cash provided by financing activities in the current year consists primarily of $4,011,823 of proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock through private placements and $1,625,000 of proceeds from the exercise of warrants, partially offset by repayments of $1,121,767 under a finance agreement. The prior year net cash from financing activities primarily consisted of $4,676,399 in proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock related to equity line draws.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2023, and 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. We are not aware of any material transactions which are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Our most critical accounting estimates are detailed below, and our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible Assets - The Company has both definite and indefinite life intangible assets.\nDefinite life intangible assets relate to patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Patent costs capitalized consist of costs incurred to acquire the underlying patent. If it is determined that a patent will not be issued, the related remaining capitalized patent costs are charged to expense. Definite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of patents is twenty years from the date of application.\nIndefinite life intangible assets include license agreements and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Company accounts for indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350. License agreement costs represent the fair value of the license agreement on the date acquired and are tested annually for impairment.\nGoodwill - Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets - We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative market-based approaches. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss for such excess. The annual fair value analysis performed on goodwill supported that goodwill is not impaired as of June 30, 2023 (see Note 4 to the financial statements).\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as licenses acquired as an In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) asset, on an annual basis we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of the licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset exceeded its fair value, due to changes in the projected economic benefits to be realized from these assets. Therefore, the Company recorded impairment losses of $18,960,000 and $93,253,000 during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively (see Note 4 to the financial statements).\nThe carrying value of IPR&D and goodwill at June 30, 2023, were $42,611,000 and $11,640,000, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and definite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The depreciable basis of assets that are impaired and continue in use are their respective fair values. No impairment was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. Under the authoritative guidance, fair value is defined as the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u25cf Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n\u25cf Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThere were no Level 1, 2 or 3 assets, nor any Level 1, 2 or 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 (see Note 1.)\nStock-Based Compensation - The Company has granted stock options, restricted share units (RSUs) and warrants to certain employees, officers, directors, and consultants. The Company accounts for options in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Stock based compensation costs for the vesting of options and RSUs granted to certain employees, officers, directors, and consultants for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $3,535,051 and $5,490,602, respectively (see Note 8 to the Financial Statements).\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs for stock option awards to employees, officers and directors based on their grant-date fair value. The value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are the expected term of the award, the underlying stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company records stock-based compensation for services received from non-employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation Non-Employees. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to consultants and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the consultants required service period, which is generally the vesting period (see Note 8 to the Financial Statements.)\nThe Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Accordingly, the Company has elected to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of its share-based awards. The simplified method computes the expected term as the sum of the awards vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two.\nRecently Enacted Accounting Standards\nFor a description of recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1: Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID:3627)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Renovaro Biosciences, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Renovaro Biosciences, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Notes 1 and 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessment\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to an acquired license treated as an in-process research and development asset (IPR&D). As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of the asset is $42,611,000 post an impairment charge of $18,960,000 taken during the year. To assess the carrying value of the IPR&D asset for impairment, management estimated the fair value of IPR&D on its elected assessment date of June 30, 2023, using a multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method. The determination of the fair value requires management to make significant estimates including, but not limited to, the discount rate used in the model, the total addressable market for each potential drug, market penetration assumptions, and for the estimated timing of commercialization of the drugs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the IPR&D.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nWe identified the impairment testing of the IPR&D asset as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes related to determining the fair value of the IPR&D asset. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate such significant estimates and assumptions.\nOur audit procedures related to the following:\n\u25cf Tested and evaluated the methods, data and significant assumptions used in developing the IPR&D fair value.\n\u25cf Evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of the selected valuation methodology and assumptions utilized by the Company including the Companys intent and ability to carry out a particular course of action.\n\u25cf Identified significant assumptions used by the Company and evaluated each assumption used to develop the estimate, both individually and in combination with other significant assumptions.\n\u25cf Testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the fair value estimate.\nIn addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the performance of these procedures.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of goodwill was $11,640,000. As described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. To assess the carrying value of the goodwill for impairment, management estimated the fair value of goodwill on its elected assessment date of June 30, 2023, using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of the fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nWe identified the evaluation of the impairment analysis for goodwill as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes in determining the fair value of the goodwill. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of such estimates and assumptions.\nOur audit procedures related to the following:\n\u25cf Tested and evaluated the methods, data and significant assumptions used in developing the fair value of goodwill.\n\u25cf Evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of the selected valuation methodology and assumptions utilized by the Company including the Companys intent and ability to carry out a particular course of action.\n\u25cf Identified significant assumptions used by the Company and evaluated each assumption used to develop the estimate, both individually and in combination with other significant assumptions.\n\u25cf Testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the fair value estimate.\nIn addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the performance of these procedures.\n/s/ Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nDraper, UT\nOctober 1, 2023\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC.

The Company has not generated any revenue, has incurred substantial recurring losses from continuing operations and has an accumulated deficit of $244,029,253\u202fas of June 30, 2023. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon (i) its ability to successfully obtain FDA approval of its product candidates, (ii) its ability to obtain any necessary debt and/or equity financing, and (iii) its ability to generate profits from the Companys future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for a year from the issuance of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nBasis of Presentation- The Company prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and follows the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nPrinciples of Consolidation- For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Renovaro, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nSubsidiaries - Renovaro Biopharma Inc. (Renovaro Biopharma), formerly Enochian Biopharma Inc., was incorporated on May 19, 2017 in Delaware and is a 100% owned subsidiary of Renovaro. Renovaro Biopharma owns a perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sublicensable, and sole and exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, use, sell, have sold, make, have made, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize certain intellectual property in cellular therapies for the prevention, treatment, amelioration of and/or therapy exclusively for HIV in humans, and research and development exclusively relating to HIV in humans. As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, zero and 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, remain contingently issuable in connection with the acquisition of Renovaro Biopharma in February 2018 (the Contingent Shares).\nRenovaro Biosciences Denmark ApS (Renovaro Denmark), formerly Enochian Biosciences Denmark ApS a Danish corporation was incorporated on April 1, 2001. On February 12, 2014, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired Renovaro Denmark and it became a 100% owned subsidiary of Renovaro subject to 185,053 shares of Common Stock of Renovaro held in escrow according to Danish law (the Escrow Shares). As of June 30, 2023, there are 17,414 Escrow Shares remaining (see Note 8).\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUse of Accounting Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated. Significant estimates include the fair value and potential impairment of intangible assets, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability, and the fair value of equity instruments issued.\nFunctional Currency and Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of Renovaro Denmark is the Danish Kroner (DKK). Renovaro Denmarks reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar for the purpose of these financial statements. Renovaro Denmarks consolidated balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rates and all revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Translation gains and losses are deferred and accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statement of operations as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash balances at June 30, 2023, and 2022, are $1,874,480 and $9,172,142, respectively. The Company had balances held in financial institutions in Denmark and in the United States in excess of federally insured amounts at June 30, 2023 and 2022 of $1,526,990, and $8,805,495, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated upon being placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from four to ten years (see Note 3).\nIntangible Assets - The Company has both definite and indefinite life intangible assets.\nDefinite life intangible assets relate to patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Patent costs capitalized consist of costs incurred to acquire the underlying patent. If it is determined that a patent will not be issued, the related remaining capitalized patent costs are charged to expense. Definite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of patents is twenty years from the date of application.\nIndefinite life intangible assets include license agreements and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Company accounts for indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350. License agreement costs represent the fair value of the license agreement on the date acquired and are tested annually for impairment on June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of the license is less than the carrying amount.\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nGoodwill - Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually as of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be less than the fair value of the reporting unit.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets - We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative market-based approaches. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss for such excess. The annual fair value analysis performed on goodwill supported that goodwill is not impaired as of June 30, 2023 (see Note 4.)\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as licenses acquired as an In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) asset, on an annual basis we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the carrying value of the licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset exceeded its fair value. Therefore, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $18,960,000 during the year ended June 30, 2023 (see Note 4.)\nThe carrying value of IPR&D and goodwill at June 30, 2023, were $42,611,000 and $11,640,000, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and definite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated. The depreciable basis of assets that are impaired and continue in use are their respective fair values. No impairment was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2023.\nLeases - In accordance with ASC Topic 842, the Company determined the initial classification and measurement of its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter. The lease terms include any renewal options and termination options that the Company is reasonably assured to exercise, if applicable. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the implicit interest rate in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company develops an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the future payments.\nEffective June 25, 2022, the Company entered into a sub-lease agreement (see Note 5.) Pursuant to ASC 842, the Company treats the sublease as a separate lease, as the Company was not relieved of the primary obligation under the original lease. The Company continued to account for the Century City Medical Plaza lease as a lessee and in the same manner as prior to the commencement date of the sublease. The Company accounted for the sublease as a lessor of the lease. The sublease was classified as an operating lease, as it did not meet the criteria of a sales-type or direct financing lease. On April 18, 2023, the Company entered into a sublease termination agreement with One Health Labs (the Subtenant), whereby the Subtenant and the Company agreed to terminate the sublease effective as of April 30, 2023. The Subtenant agreed to pay the Company $139,460 along with the security deposit of $35,540 for a total termination fee of $175,000, to permit early termination of the sublease.\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis, unless the operating lease right-of-use assets have been impaired, over the reasonably assured lease term based on the total lease payments and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. For operating leases that reflect impairment, the Company will recognize the amortization of the operating lease right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term with rent expense still included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. The Companys non-lease components are primarily related to property maintenance, insurance and taxes, which vary based on future outcomes, and thus are recognized in general and administrative expenses when incurred (see Note 5.)\nResearch and Development Expenses - The Company expenses research and development costs incurred in formulating, improving, validating, and creating alternative or modified processes related to and expanding the use of the HIV, HBV, and Oncology therapies and technologies for use in the prevention, treatment, amelioration of and/or therapy for HIV, HBV, and Oncology. Research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $4,165,197 and $8,372,800, respectively.\nIncome Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes (see Note 7.)\nLoss Per Share - The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share (EPS) are based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per common share are based on shares outstanding (computed as for basic EPS) and potentially dilutive common shares. Potential shares of Common Stock included in the diluted earnings per share calculation include in-the-money stock options that have been granted but have not been exercised. The shares of Common Stock outstanding at June 30, 2023 and 2022 were 63,698,144 and 53,007,082, respectively. Because of the net loss for each of the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, dilutive shares for both periods were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, as the effect of these potential shares of Common Stock is anti-dilutive. The Company had 7,949,513 and 6,807,820 potential shares of Common Stock excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. Under the authoritative guidance, fair value is defined as the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1. Observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u25cf Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n\u25cf Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThere were no Level 1, 2, or 3 assets, nor any Level 1, 2, or 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023.\nAs a result of the contingent consideration liability being extinguished during the fiscal year, a fair value option model evaluation was not performed as of June 30, 2023.\nUnless otherwise disclosed, the fair value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable, approximate their recorded values due to their short-term nature.\nThe following table sets forth the liabilities at June 30, 2023 and 2022, which are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value on a recurring basis by level of input within the fair value hierarchy. As required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\nSummary of significant to the fair value measurement Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Identical Assets Inputs Significant Other\nObservable Inputs Significant Other Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nContingent Consideration Liability at June 30, 2023 $ - $ - $ -\nThe roll forward of the contingent consideration liability is as follows:\nBalance June 30, 2022 - - 2,343,318\nContingent Shares issued pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement\n(2,762,500 )\nLoss on extinguishment of contingent Consideration - - 419,182\nBalance June 30, 2023 $ - $ - $ -\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Identical Assets Inputs Significant Other\nObservable Inputs Significant Other Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nContingent Consideration Liability at June 30, 2022 $ - $ - $ 2,343,318\nThe roll forward of the contingent consideration liability is as follows:\nBalance June 30, 2021 - - 6,037,945\nContingent Shares issued pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement\n(798,000 )\nFair value adjustment - - (2,896,627 )\nBalance June 30, 2022 $ - $ - $ 2,343,318\nStock-Based Compensation - The Company has granted stock options, restricted share units (RSUs) and warrants to certain employees, officers, directors, and consultants. The Company accounts for options in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Stock based compensation costs for the vesting of options and RSUs granted to certain employees, officers, directors, and consultants for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $3,535,051 and $5,490,602, respectively.\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs for stock option awards to employees, officers and directors based on their grant-date fair value. The value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are the expected term of the award, the underlying stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company records stock-based compensation for services received from non-employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation Non-Employees. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to consultants and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued and are recognized over the consultants required service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. Accordingly, the Company has elected to use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of its share-based awards. The simplified method computes the expected term as the sum of the awards vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted - Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that have not yet been adopted by the Company are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys present or future consolidated financial statements.\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has incurred substantial recurring losses from continuing operations, has used cash in the Companys continuing operations, and is dependent on additional financing to fund operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $39,684,056 and $113,433,392 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,874,480 and an accumulated deficit of $244,029,253. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. Management intends to raise additional funds for (a) research and development, (b) increases in personnel, and (c) the purchase of equipment, specifically to advance the Companys potential products through the regulatory process. The Company may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or debt securities. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect the Companys growth plans, financial condition and results of operations.\nNOTE 3 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following at June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSchedule of property and equipment\nUseful Life\nJune 30, 2023\nJune 30, 2022\nLab equipment and instruments\n4-7\n$ 576,298\n$ 546,524\nLeasehold improvements\n224,629\n224,629\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment\n4-7\n172,861\n172,861\nTotal\n973,788\n944,014\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(464,799 )\n(357,478 )\nNet Property and Equipment\n$ 508,989\n$ 586,536\nDepreciation expense amounted to $107,321 and $108,595 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, definite-life intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, consisted of patents on the Companys products and processes of $39,676 and $44,268, respectively. The patents are recorded at cost and amortized over twenty years from the date of application. Amortization expense for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $6,175 and $14,995, respectively.\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, indefinite life intangible assets consisted of a license agreement classified as In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) intangible assets, which are not amortizable until the intangible assets provide economic benefit, and goodwill.\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, definite-life and indefinite-life intangible assets consisted of the following:\nSchedule of intangible assets\nUseful Life June 30, 2022 Period Change Effect of Currency Translation June 30, 2023\nDefinite Life Intangible Assets\nPatents Years $ 279,257 $ - 11,679 $ 290,936\nLess Accumulated Amortization\n(234,989 ) (6,175 ) (10,096 ) (251,260 )\nNet Definite-Life Intangible Assets\n$ 44,268 $ (6,175 ) $ 1,583 $ 39,676\nIndefinite Life Intangible Assets\nLicense Agreement\n$ 61,571,000 $ (18,960,000 ) $ - $ 42,611,000\nGoodwill\n11,640,000 - - 11,640,000\nTotal Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\n$ 73,211,000 $ (18,960,000 ) $ - $ 54,251,000\nExpected future amortization expense is as follows:\nSchedule of expected future amortization expense\nYears ended June 30,\n$ 9,919\n9,919\n9,919\n9,919\nTotal $ 39,676\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDuring February 2018, the Company acquired a License Agreement (as licensee) to the HIV therapy being developed as RENB-HV-01 which consists of a perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sub-licensable, and sole and exclusive worldwide license to research, develop, use, sell, have sold, make, have made, offer for sale, import and otherwise commercialize certain intellectual property in cellular therapies for the prevention, treatment, amelioration of and/or therapy exclusively for HIV in humans, and research and development exclusively relating to HIV in humans. Because the HIV License Agreement is considered an IPR&D intangible asset, it is classified as an indefinite life asset that is tested annually for impairment.\nImpairment - Following the fourth quarter of each year, management performs its annual test of impairment of intangible assets by performing a quantitative assessment and determines if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is greater than or equal to the carrying value of the asset. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the results of the quantitative assessment indicated that the carrying value of the licenses acquired as an IPR&D asset exceeded its fair value, due to the changes in the projected economic benefits to be realized from these assets. Therefore, an impairment adjustment of $18,960,000 and $93,253,000 was recorded for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE 5 - LEASES\nOperating Leases - On November 13, 2017, Renovaro entered into a lease agreement for a term of five years and two months from November 1, 2017 with Plaza Medical Office Building, LLC, pursuant to which Renovaro agreed to lease approximately 2,325 rentable square feet (the Plaza Lease). The base rent for the Plaza Lease increased by 3% each year, and ranged from approximately $8,719 per month, for the first year to $10,107 per month for the two months of the sixth year. The lease was terminated early without penalties or additional costs as of September 30, 2022, that released an accrual of $70,800 related to leasehold improvements that was not utilized.\nOn June 19, 2018, Renovaro entered into a lease agreement for a term of ten years from September 1, 2018 with Century City Medical Plaza Land Co., Inc., pursuant to which the Company agreed to lease approximately 2,453 rentable square feet. On February 20, 2019, the Registrant entered into an Addendum to the original lease agreement with an effective date of December 1, 2019, where it expanded the leased area to include another 1,101 square feet for a total rentable 3,554 square feet. The base rent increases by 3% each year, and ranges from $17,770 per month as of the date of the amendment to $23,186 per month for the tenth year. The equalized monthly lease payment for the term of the lease is $20,050. The Company subleased the space as of June 25, 2022 through April 30, 2023 (see subsection below Sublease Agreement for details.)\nThe Company identified and assessed the following significant assumptions in recognizing the right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities:\nExpected lease term - The expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and, when applicable, cancelable option periods when it is reasonably certain that the Company would exercise such options. The Companys lease has a remaining lease term of 50 months. As of June 30, 2023, the weighted-average remaining term is 4.17 years.\nIncremental borrowing rate - The Companys lease agreement does not provide an implicit rate. As the Company does not have any external borrowings for comparable terms of its lease, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve rate that corresponds to the length of each lease. This rate is an estimate of what the Company would have to pay if borrowing on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. As of June 30, 2023, the weighted-average discount rate is 4.03%.\nLease and non-lease components - In certain cases the Company is required to pay for certain additional charges for operating costs, including insurance, maintenance, taxes, and other costs incurred, which are billed based on both usage and as a percentage of the Companys share of total square footage. The Company determined that these costs are non-lease components, and they are not included in the calculation of the lease liabilities because they are variable. Payments for these variable, non-lease components are considered variable lease costs and are recognized in the period in which the costs are incurred.\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBelow are the lease commitments for the next 5 years:\nSchedule of lease commitments\nYears Ending June 30 Lease Expense\n$ 246,004\n253,384\n260,985\n268,815\n45,020\nLess imputed interest (105,199 )\nTotal $ 969,009\nSublease Agreement\nOn June 20, 2022, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with One Health Labs (the Subtenant), whereby the Subtenant agreed to lease 3,554 square feet of space currently rented by the Company in Century City Medical Plaza as of June 25, 2022 for a period of 3.5 years with an option to renew for the remaining term of the lease that ends as of June 19, 2028. The base rent was $17,770 per month plus $750 towards utility fees that are part of the original lease agreement would have increased by 3% each year over the term of the sublease. The Company received a total of $57,022 on July 1, 2022 after execution of the sublease to cover the first month rent, utility fee and deposit. The first sublease payment began on August 1, 2022.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 842, the Company treats the sublease as a separate lease, as the Company was not relieved of the primary obligation under the original lease. The Company continues to account for the Century City Medical Plaza lease as a lessee and in the same manner as prior to the commencement date of the sublease. The Company accounts for the sublease as a lessor of the lease. The sublease is classified as an operating lease, as it does not meet the criteria of a sales-type or direct financing lease.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Company entered into a sublease termination agreement with the Subtenant, whereby the Subtenant and the Company agreed to terminate the sublease effective as of April 30, 2023. The Subtenant agreed to pay the Company $139,460 along with the security deposit of $35,540 for a total termination fee of $175,000, to permit early termination of the sublease.\nThe Company recognized operating income from the sublease on a straight-line basis in its statements of operations over the lease term. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company paid $439,519 in operating leases.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the net operating lease expenses were as follows:\nSchedule of net operating lease expenses\nYears ended June 30,\nOperating Lease Expense\n$ 322,447\n$ 356,073\nSub-lease Income\n(352,700 )\n(2,962 )\nTotal Net Lease Expense\n$ (30,253)\n$ 353,111\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6 - NOTES PAYABLE\nConvertible Notes Payable- On February 6, 2020, the Company issued two Convertible Notes (the Convertible Notes) to Paseco APS (the Holder), a Danish limited company and an existing stockholder of the Company each with a face value amount of $600,000, convertible into shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share. The outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes was due and payable on February 6, 2023. Interest on the Convertible Notes commenced accruing on the date of issuance at six percent (6%) per annum, computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months, and was compounded monthly on the final day of each calendar month based upon the principal and all accrued and unpaid interest outstanding as of such compound date. The interest was payable in cash on a semi-annual basis.\nThe conversion price was equal to $12.00 per share of Common Stock. The Holder did not exercise the conversion feature that expired on February 6, 2021. The Company evaluated the Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC 470-20 and identified that they each contain an embedded conversion feature that shall not be bifurcated from the host document (i.e., the Convertible Notes) as they are not deemed to be readily convertible into cash. All proceeds received from the issuance were recognized as a liability on the balance sheet.\nEffective December 30, 2022 (the Effective Date), the Company amended and restated the Convertible Notes (the Amended and Restated Secured Notes). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Secured Notes, the due date was extended to February 28, 2024, unless the Company consummates a public offering or private placement prior to the maturity date (a Qualified Offering) and the Holder elects to convert the outstanding principal balance into Common Stock at the price being paid by the investors in such Qualified Offering. The interest was increased to twelve percent (12%) per annum, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the date of amendment through the issuance of 198,439 shares of the Companys Common Stock which is comprised of 29,419 shares for accrued interest up to the Effective Date and 169,020 shares related to the prepayment of interest through the extension date of the Amended and Restated Secured Notes using the closing market price on the Effective Date, of $1.03. The obligations of the Company under the Amended and Restated Secured Notes were secured by a security agreement (the Security Agreement). The Company evaluated the Amended and Restated Secured Notes and conversion feature to determine the appropriate accounting treatment based on the terms of the agreement. In accordance with ASC 480-Distinguising Liabilities from Equity, the Company determined that the Amended and Restated Secured Notes embody an obligation that may require the Company to settle with the issuance of a variable number of shares, where the monetary value of the obligation is based predominantly on a fixed monetary amount of $1,200,000 known at inception. Accordingly, the Company recorded the Amended and Restated Secured Notes as share settled debt. The total value of the shares issued was $204,392 which included $174,090 of prepaid interest and $30,302 for accrued interest as of December 30, 2022. On June 26, 2023, the holder of the Amended and Restated Secured Notes notified the Company that they wished to elect to exercise their conversion right triggered by a private placement. Therefore, all outstanding $1,200,000 Amended and Restated Secured Notes were converted into 2,264,150 shares of Common Stock and 1,132,075 Warrants. There were no Amended and Restated Secured Notes outstanding after the foregoing conversion.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded accrued interest in the amount of zero 0 and $24,181, which is included in accrued expenses, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the interest expense related to the Convertible Notes amounted to $210,543 and $72,875 respectively. The Convertible Notes balance as of June 30, 2023 was zero 0.\nNote Payable- On March 30, 2020 (the Issuance Date), the Company issued a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $5,000,000 (the Promissory Note) to the Holder. The principal amount of the Promissory Note was originally payable on November 30, 2021 (the Maturity Date). The Promissory Note bore interest at a fixed rate of 6% per annum, computed based on the number of days between the Issuance Date and the Maturity Date, which was prepaid by the Company in full on the Issuance Date through the issuance of 188,485 shares of the Companys Common Stock based on the closing market price on that date for a total value of $501,370. The Company evaluated the Promissory Note and PIK interest in accordance with ASC 470-Debt and ASC 835-Interest, respectively. Pursuant to ASC 470-20, proceeds received from the issuance are to be recognized at their relative fair value, thus the liability is shown net of the corresponding discount of $493,192, which is the relative fair value of the shares issued for the PIK interest on the closing date using the effective interest method. The discount of $493,192 will be accreted over the life of the Promissory Note.\nRENOVARO BIOSCIENCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn February 11, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the Promissory Note that extended the Maturity Date to November 30, 2022.

The Holder elected the interest be paid in cash (the Interest Payment).\nEffective December 30, 2022, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Promissory Note. Pursuant to the third amendment, the Companys obligations under the Promissory Note were secured by a Security Agreement. To secure the Companys obligations under each of the Amended and Restated Secured Notes and the Promissory Note, the Company entered into a Security Agreement with the Holder, pursuant to which the Company granted a lien on all assets of the Company (the Collateral) for the benefit of the Holder. Upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Amended and Restated Secured Notes and Promissory Note, respectively) the Holder may, among other things, collect or take possession of the Collateral, proceed with the foreclosure of the security interest in the Collateral or sell, lease, or dispose of the Collateral.\nOn June 12, 2023, the Holder notified the Company that it wanted to apply the Interest Payment due to it towards the Companys next private placement.

The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the deferred tax assets for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the Companys future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which cannot be determined.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $476,965,239 and $244,899,881, respectively, giving rise to deferred tax assets of $140,547,314 and $71,299,011 respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn accordance with prevailing accounting guidance, the Company is required to recognize and disclose any income tax uncertainties. The guidance provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring tax benefits and liabilities when realization of the tax position is uncertain. The first step is to determine whether the tax position meets the more- likely-than-not condition for recognition, and the second step is to determine the amount to be recognized based on the cumulative probability that exceeds 50%. The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the deferred tax assets for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the Companys future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which can be difficult to determine and can only be estimated. Management estimates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate adequate net profits to use the deferred tax assets; and consequently, a valuation allowance was recorded for all deferred tax assets.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to income tax expense at the Companys effective rate is as follows for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSchedule of reconciliation of income tax expense\nYears ended June 30,\nComputed tax at expected statutory rate\n$ (70,341,751 )\n$ (59,450,176 )\nNon-US income taxed at different rates\n-\n-\nNon-deductible expenses / other items\n-\nValuation allowance\n70,341,751\n59,450,176\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n$ -\n$\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nSchedule of components of income tax expense (benefit)\nYears ended June 30,\nCurrent Income Tax Expense\nDanish income tax (benefit)\n$ -\n$ -\nTotal Current Tax Expense (Benefit)\n$ -\n$ -\nDeferred Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\nExcess of tax over book depreciation of fixed assets\n$ 8,258\n$ 6,406\nExcess of tax over book depreciation of patents\n8,415\n5,716\nStock/options compensation\n3,885,996\n2,831,137\nDepreciation and amortization\n152,059\n118,020\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n140,547,314\n71,299,011\nChange in tax rate\n-\n-\nChange in the valuation allowance\n(144,602,042 )\n(74,260,290 )\nTotal Deferred Tax Expense\n$ -\n$ -\nDeferred income tax expense (benefit) results primarily from the reversal of temporary timing differences between tax and financial statement income.\nNOTE 8 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nPreferred Stock - The Company has 10,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share.
