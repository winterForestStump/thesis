Business\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we provide a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments. Consistent with our vertical integration strategy, our primary operations consist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (HMA) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates, such as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nConstruction Partners, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2007 as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction industry.\nAs used in this report, the terms Company, we, our and us refer to Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except when the context requires that those terms mean only the parent company or a particular subsidiary.\n2023 Fiscal Year Developments\nAcquisitions. During the 2023 fiscal year, we completed five acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. As a result of these acquisitions, we added eight asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction professionals. The total transaction consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $92.0 million. We also disposed of a quarry in North Carolina, resulting in total cash proceeds of $37.0 million and a gain on the facility exchange of $5.4 million. For further discussion regarding these transactions, see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInflationary and Supply Chain Trends. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we continued to experience an upward trend in certain inflation-sensitive inputs for our products and services, including upward pressure on wages and increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce HMA, such as liquid asphalt and aggregate materials. We also experienced some disruptions from subcontractors, materials suppliers, equipment manufacturers and others in our supply chain, although to a lesser extent than in recent years. We have been able to mitigate some of the effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor constraints on our business by increasing prices for our products and including the anticipated cost increases in the construction projects we bid. However, we are limited in our ability to pass through increased costs for projects already in our backlog and, under those circumstances, may be unable to recoup losses or diminished profit margins by passing these costs through to our customers.\nOur Industry\nWe operate in the large and growing highway and road construction industry and specifically within the asphalt paving materials and services segment. Asphalt paving mix is the most common roadway material used today due to its cost effectiveness, durability and reusability, and minimized traffic disruption during paving, as compared to concrete. Recent growth in our industry has been driven by federal, state and local Department of Transportation (DOT) budgets, which annually earmark amounts for transportation and infrastructure spending. The federal Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act (the FAST Act), which was signed into law in 2015, provided funding for surface transportation infrastructure through September 30, 2020, and a continuing resolution approved in October 2020 extended the FAST Act surface transportation programs by one year and added $13.6 billion to the federal Highway Trust Fund. In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the IIJA) was signed into law. The IIJA provides for $548 billion in new infrastructure spending over five years through a reauthorization of traditional surface transportation programs and additional funding for highways, bridges and airports, among other things. In addition, certain states within our markets have in recent years approved legislation that supports funding for construction of local road, bridge and transit projects. The non-discretionary nature of highway and road construction services and materials supports stable and consistent industry funding. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides funding for numerous projects and initiatives relevant to the surface transportation industry, including grants for safety and environmental improvements, incentives for the use of construction materials and products with lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, and streamlined environmental review processes for proposed projects.\nProjects and Customers\nWe provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States. We provide a wide range of large sitework construction, including site development, paving, and utility and drainage systems construction, and supply the HMA required for the projects. Our projects consist of both new construction and maintenance services. Publicly funded projects and third-party sales accounted for approximately 63%, and privately funded projects and third-party sales accounted for approximately 37%, of our fiscal 2023 revenues. Our public customers include federal agencies, state DOTs and local municipalities. Our private clients include commercial and residential developers and businesses.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Florida DOT and North Carolina DOT accounted for 10.7% and 10.5% of our revenues, respectively. Other than the Florida DOT and North Carolina DOT, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and projects performed for all DOTs accounted for 36.2% of our revenues. Our 25 largest projects accounted for 16.5% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nTypes of Contracts\nOur public customer contracts are primarily fixed unit price contracts. Pricing on a fixed unit price contract is typically based on approved quantities. Our private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. We also occasionally enter into design-build contracts, which generally are performed under fixed total price contracts. For the majority of our contracts, we receive our final payment upon completion and final acceptance of the services that we were contracted to perform and delivery of the necessary contract closing documents, and our obligations to the owner are complete at that point. For some contracts, we are required to furnish a warranty on our construction. These warranties, when required, are usually one year in length, but can extend up to three years according to the owners specifications. Historically, warranty claims have not been material to our business.\nContract Management\nWe identify potential contracts through a variety of sources, including: (i) subscriber services that consolidate and alert us to contracts open for bidding; (ii) posted solicitations by federal, state and local governmental entities through agency websites, disclosure of long-term infrastructure plans or advertising and other general solicitations; (iii) our business development efforts; and (iv) communications with other participants in our industry. We consider several factors that can create variability in contract performance and our financial results compared to our bid assumptions and methodologies on a contract. As a result, after determining the potential contracts that are available, we decide which contracts to pursue based on a non-exclusive list of factors, which include relevant skills required by the contract, the contract size and duration, availability of our personnel and equipment, size and makeup of our current contract backlog, our competitive advantages and disadvantages, our prior experience, the contracting agency or customer, the source of contract funding, the geographic location, the likely competition, the construction risks, the gross margin opportunities, the penalties or incentives and the type of contract.\nTo ensure the completeness and accuracy of our original bid analysis, the bid preparation for potential projects typically involves three phases.\nPhase One: We review the plans and specifications of the project so that we can identify (i) the various types of work involved and related estimated materials, (ii) the contract duration and schedule, and (iii) any unique aspects or significant risk factors of the project.\nPhase Two: We estimate the cost and availability of labor, materials and equipment, subcontractors and the project team required to complete the contract in accordance with the plans, specifications and construction schedule. Substantially all of our estimates are made on a per-unit basis for each bid item, with the typical contract containing 50 to 200 bid items.\nPhase Three: Management conducts a detailed review of the estimate. This review includes an analysis of assumptions regarding (i) cost, approach, means and methods of completing the project, (ii) staffing and productivity and (iii) risk. After concluding this detailed review of the cost estimate, management determines the appropriate profit margin to calculate the total bid amount. This profit margin varies according to managements perception of the degree of difficulty of the contract, the existing competitive climate and the size and makeup of our contract backlog. Throughout this process, we work closely with our project managers so that all issues concerning a contract, including any risks, can be better understood and addressed as appropriate.\nTo ensure that subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts do not change, we obtain firm quotations from our subcontractors before submitting a bid. Also, to mitigate the risk of material price changes, we obtain not to exceed quotations from our suppliers, which, for projects of longer duration, usually contain price escalator provisions. These quotations typically include\nquantity guarantees that are tied to our prime contract. We have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided.\nAfter a contract has been awarded and during the construction phase, we monitor our progress by comparing actual costs incurred and quantities completed to date with budgeted amounts and the project schedule. We review our estimates of total forecasted revenue, cost and expected profit for each contract monthly.\nDuring the normal course of some projects, we or our customer may initiate modifications or changes to the original contract to reflect, among other things, changes in quantities, specifications or design, method or manner of performance, facilities, materials, site conditions and period for completion of the work. Generally, the scope and price of these modifications are documented in a change order to the original contract and reviewed, approved and paid for in accordance with the normal change order provisions of the contract. Occasionally, we are asked to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original contract plans and specifications or, even if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not be settled to our satisfaction. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for an extended period of time until the change order is approved and funded by the customer. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other work on the contract (or on other contracts) and our ability to meet contract milestone dates. Historically, we have been successful at managing the impacts caused by change orders, and change orders have not had a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our contracts with governmental agencies provide for termination at the convenience of the customer, with requirements to pay us for work performed through the date of termination. The termination of a government contract for the convenience of the customer is an extremely rare occurrence. Many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met. Historically, we have not been materially adversely affected by liquidated damages provisions.\nWe act as prime contractor on most of our construction projects. As prime contractor, we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. To manage the risk of non-performance by our subcontractors, we typically require the subcontractor to furnish a bond or other type of security to guarantee its performance and/or we retain payments in accordance with contract terms until their performance is complete. Disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our good faith efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged contractors or suppliers.\nContract Backlog\nAt September 30, 2023, our contract backlog was $1.6 billion compared to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2022. Contract backlog is a financial measure that generally reflects the dollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in the future. Although contract backlog is not a term recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), it is a common measure used in our industry. We generally include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Our backlog generally consists of uncompleted work on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not commenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include (i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of uncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet begun was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur backlog also includes low bid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private work projects for which we have been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog was $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023, we expected approximately 73% of our contract backlog to be completed during the next 12 months.\nCertain customer contracts contain options that are exercisable at the discretion of our customer to award additional work to us, without requiring us to go through an additional competitive bidding process. In addition, some customer contracts also contain task orders that are signed under master contracts pursuant to which we perform work only when the customer awards specific task orders to us. Awarded contracts that include unexercised contract options and unissued task orders are included in contract backlog to the extent that the exercise of such options or the issuance of such task orders is probable.\nSubstantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog, as well as unexercised contract options and unissued task orders, may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer. Historically, we have not experienced material amounts of contract cancellations or modifications. Many projects are added to our contract backlog and completed within the same fiscal year and therefore may not be\nreflected in our beginning or year-end contract backlog. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA, aggregates, and liquid asphalt cement.\nInsurance and Bonding\nWe maintain general and excess liability, property, workers compensation and medical insurance, all in amounts consistent with industry practice.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security to the customer for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have bonded and their underwriting standards. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation.\nCompetition\nWe compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in which we operate. Competition is constrained in our industry because participants are limited by the distance that materials can be efficiently transported, resulting in a fragmented market with thousands of participants nationwide, many of which are local or regional operators. Our competitors typically range from small, family-owned companies focused on a single material, product or market to multinational corporations that offer a wide array of construction materials, products and paving and related services. Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, estimating abilities, knowledge of local markets and conditions, project management, financial strength, reputation for quality, aggregate materials availability and machinery and equipment. We believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher activity and revenues during those quarters. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our third fiscal quarter varies greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenue in the third fiscal quarter, while a warm, dry spring may facilitate earlier project commencement dates.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe purchase raw materials, including, but not limited to, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt, other petroleum-based resources, sand and rock from numerous sources. With few exceptions, we do not enter into long-term agreements to purchase raw materials. We receive quotes from suppliers, most with a not to exceed price for the quoted product over the life of a project. In the HMA production process, components of a mix include virgin aggregates, such as sand and rock, liquid asphalt, and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). We are able to internally supply RAP, a byproduct of asphalt resurfacing projects, to all of our HMA plants, and virgin aggregates in some of our market areas. The majority of our HMA plants sit in or near suppliers aggregates facilities, thereby reducing the hauling cost of material to our plant. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year due to market conditions and production capacities. We do not expect a lack of availability of any raw materials over the next 12 months.\nGovernment and Environmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the environmental, health and safety aspects of our operations or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations and limitations on our operations, including:\nrequirements to obtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities;\nrestrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment;\nlimitation or prohibition of activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas;\nobligations to restore or reclaim former mining areas;\nrequirements to comply with specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and\nthe imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nSuch federal laws include (i) the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Pollution Prevention Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, governing solid and hazardous waste management, (ii) the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, protecting air and water resources, and (iii) the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and Toxic Substances Control Act, governing the management of hazardous materials, (iv) the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, requiring certain disclosures of mining-related health and safety violations, orders, citations, assessments, legal actions, and mining-related fatalities, and (v) the Occupational Safety and Health Act, governing working conditions for workers, in addition to analogous state laws. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and corresponding state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, compensatory damages, injunctive relief, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of fault is required) as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed, stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at which we have disposed of materials, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from the consequences of our own actions that complied with applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the construction industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. To the extent that laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts our operations or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We believe that our operations and facilities, whether owned or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any existing non-compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nIndustrial operations, including equipment maintenance and storage, asphalt manufacturing and processing, underground storage tank usage and other storage and use of hazardous materials and petroleum products, are conducted at our facilities, and in some cases, have been conducted at our facilities for more than 50 years. While we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, we have, from time to time, identified contamination associated with these activities at certain of our facilities. We have incurred costs in connection with the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances and petroleum products identified at several facilities, and investigation and remediation activities are ongoing at others. We may also become subject to similar liabilities in connection with prior and future acquisitions. We do not believe that liabilities associated with known or potential contamination at any of our facilities will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2023, we employed 1,146 salaried employees and 2,868 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel at a given time is subject to the volume of projects in progress and fluctuates on a seasonal basis. During fiscal year 2023, the number of hourly employees ranged from 2,656 to 2,892 employees and averaged 2,782 employees. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with respect to any of our employees. We believe that we have strong relationships with our employees.\nOur business depends on a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Attracting, training and retaining key personnel has been and will remain critical to our success. Through the use of our management information systems, on-the-job training, and educational seminars, employees are trained to understand the importance of project execution. We place additional focus on training related to estimating, project management and project cost control. Our crews typically specialize in a specific phase of construction, such as grading or paving, with each crew member assigned to a specific task in order to maximize daily production. A core tenet of our organizational philosophy is to promote from within and offer advancement opportunities at all levels of employment, which helps us retain talented employees. Moreover, we proactively recruit additional talent in both conventional and creative manners to fill open positions when promoting internally is not an option. Like others in our industry, we experience some recurring employee turnover; however, we historically have been able to attract sufficient numbers of personnel to support the growth of our operations. Nonetheless, we continue to face competition for experienced workers in all of our markets.\nWe place a great emphasis on the safety of the public, our customers and our employees. To that end, we conduct extensive safety training programs, which have allowed us to maintain a high safety level at our worksites. All newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation, and for certain types of projects and processes, we conduct specific hazard training programs. Our project foremen and superintendents conduct on-site safety meetings, and our full-time safety inspectors make random site safety inspections and perform assessments. In addition, certain operational employees are required to complete a safety course approved by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), as applicable. Moreover, we promote a culture of safety by encouraging employees to immediately correct and report all unsafe conditions.\nWebsite Information\nThe Company maintains a website at www.constructionpartners.net.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Class A common stock involves risks. You should carefully read and consider the following risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, particularly in the southeastern United States, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe currently operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. A significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions or uncertainty regarding the economic outlook in the United States generally, or in any of these states particularly, could reduce demand for infrastructure projects. Demand for infrastructure projects depends on overall economic conditions, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state and local government spending levels. In particular, low tax revenues, credit rating downgrades, budget deficits and financing constraints, including timing and amount of federal funding and competing governmental priorities, could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new public infrastructure projects. In addition, any instability in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our customers ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already in progress, could cause our customers to delay or cancel construction projects in our contract backlog and could create difficulties for customers to obtain adequate financing to fund new construction projects, including through the issuance of municipal bonds.\nOur business depends on federal, state and local government spending for public infrastructure construction, and reductions in government funding could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we generated approximately 63% of our construction contract revenues from publicly funded construction projects and the sale of construction materials to public customers at the federal, state and local levels. As a result, if publicly funded construction decreases due to reduced federal, state or local funding or otherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nFederal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent the maximum amounts available for federally funded construction projects. Each year, Congress passes an appropriation act establishing the amount that can be used for particular programs. The annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the federal Highway Trust Fund. Once Congress passes the annual appropriation, the federal government distributes funds to each state based on formulas or other procedures. States generally must spend these funds on the specific programs outlined in the federal legislation. In recent years, the Highway Trust Fund has faced insolvency as outlays have outpaced revenues, and annual shortfalls have been addressed primarily by short-term measures. In November 2021, the IIJA was signed into law, which increases federal spending on surface transportation programs and provides additional funding for highways, bridges and airports over a five-year period. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022 provides funding for a variety of infrastructure-related programs. Although these laws provide for funding at historically high levels, the timing, nature and scale of the projects for which these funds under these programs or otherwise will be used remains uncertain given variations in the appropriation processes at the federal and state levels. As a result, we cannot be assured of the existence, timing or amount of future federal highway funding. Federal highway funding is also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional spending as a whole, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Any reduction in federal highway funding, particularly in the amounts allocated to states in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEach state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various state taxes, typically fuel taxes and vehicle fees, as well as from voter-approved bond programs. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amount spent or delay expenditures on state infrastructure projects. Many states have experienced state-level funding pressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects. To address these pressures, some states have adopted measures to promote stable funding for infrastructure investment, including special-purpose taxes and increased fuel taxes. Any reduction in state infrastructure funding in the states in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from state DOTs. The loss of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with state DOTs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Florida DOT and the North Carolina DOT accounted for 10.7% and 10.5% of our revenues, respectively, and projects performed for all state DOTs accounted for 36.2% of our revenues. We believe that we will continue to rely on state DOTs for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss or reduction of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with state DOTs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies, Concentration of Risks, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information relating to concentrations of revenues by type of customer and for a description of our largest customers.\nGovernment contracts generally are subject to a variety of regulations, requirements and statutes, the violation or alleged violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur contracts with governmental agencies are generally subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. We may be subject to claims for civil or criminal fraud for actual or alleged violations of these governmental regulations, requirements or statutes. In addition, we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, or if we have a substantial number of workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Even if we have not violated these regulations, requirements or statutes, allegations of violations or defending qui tam litigation could harm our reputation and require us to incur material costs to defend any such allegations or lawsuits. Any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe cancellation of a significant number of contracts, our disqualification from bidding on new contracts and the unpredictable timing of new project opportunities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment contracts typically can be canceled at any time, with us receiving payment only for the work completed. The cancellation of an unfinished contract could result in lost revenues and cause our equipment to be idled for a significant period of time until other\ncomparable work becomes available. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on certain government contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. For example, various laws, including those governing wages, benefits, overtime, working conditions, equal employment opportunity, affirmative action and drug testing, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances involving violations of those laws. In addition, federal and state laws provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances, including as a result of being convicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The scope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts of a particular case and the grounds for debarment. Finally, the timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Project awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on our projects, we may incur contract losses or achieve lower profits than anticipated.\nPricing on fixed unit price contracts is based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual costs, and contracts with a fixed total price require that the work be performed for an agreed-upon price irrespective of our actual costs. We generate profits on fixed unit price and fixed total price contracts only when our revenues exceed our actual costs, which requires us to accurately estimate and control our costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates are too low or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause us to incur a loss or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The costs incurred and profit realized, if any, on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\nthe failure to include materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a fixed total price contract;\ndelays caused by weather conditions or otherwise failing to meet scheduled acceptance dates;\ncontract or project modifications or conditions creating unanticipated costs that are not covered by change orders;\nchanges in the availability, proximity and costs of materials, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials, as well as fuel and lubricants for our equipment;\nto the extent not covered by contractual cost escalators, variability in, and our inability to predict, the costs of diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and cement;\nthe availability and skill level of workers;\nonsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\nthe failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers or customers to perform their obligations;\nfraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, customers or personnel;\nmechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;\ncitations issued by a government authority, including OSHA or MSHA;\ndifficulties in obtaining required government permits or approvals;\nchanges in applicable laws and regulations;\nuninsured claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part; and\npublic infrastructure customers seeking to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions that result in increased risks to us.\nThese and other factors may cause us to incur losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nInflation and supply chain disruptions have resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, some of which we may not be able to recoup.\nInflation and supply chain disruptions have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to pass through increased costs to our customers. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we continued to experience an upward trend in several inflation-sensitive inputs that we use to provide our products and services,\nincluding upward pressure on wages and increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce HMA and other items critical to our business, including fuel, concrete and steel. In addition, we continued to experience disruptions from various participants in our supply chains, including subcontractors, materials suppliers and equipment manufacturers, who provide the raw materials, equipment, vehicles, construction supplies and other services we require in order to manufacture HMA and perform our construction projects. While we have been able to mitigate some of the effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions and upward wage pressures on our business by increasing prices for our products and including the anticipated cost increases in the construction projects for which we bid, we may not be able to do so in the future. In addition, we are limited in our ability to pass through increased costs for projects already in our backlog, and if we are unable to do so, we may not recoup our losses or diminished profit margins. If inflation and supply chain disruptions continue to rise, we may be required to implement further price adjustments to maintain our profit margin, and any price increases may have a negative effect on demand.\nBecause our industry is capital-intensive and we have significant fixed and semi-fixed costs, our profitability is sensitive to changes in volume.\nThe property, plants and equipment needed to produce our products and provide our services can be expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain such assets. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plants and equipment necessary to operate our business, or if the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, due to the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs associated with our business, particularly at our HMA production facilities, aggregates facilities and our mobile equipment fleets, volume decreases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy, to successfully integrate acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses.\nSince our inception, we have acquired and integrated 41 complementary businesses, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business, including acquisitions in the southeastern United States, as part of our ongoing growth strategy. We cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions. To successfully acquire a target, we may need to raise additional equity and/or incur additional indebtedness, which could increase our leverage level. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete acquisition transactions on favorable terms, or at all. The investigation of acquisition candidates and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments require substantial management time and attention and costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed acquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions typically require integration of the acquired companys estimation, project management, finance, information technology, risk management, purchasing and fleet management functions. We may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired business into our existing business, and an acquired business may not be as profitable as we had expected or at all. Acquisitions involve risks that the acquired business will not perform as expected and that our expectations concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the acquired business will prove incorrect. Our inability to successfully integrate new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs, reduce profits or generate losses and prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business. Factors affecting the successful integration of an acquired business include, but are not limited to, the following:\nour responsibility for certain liabilities of an acquired business, whether or not known to us, which could include, among other things, tax liabilities, product and other tort liabilities, breach of contract claims, environmental liabilities, permitting and regulatory compliance issues and liabilities for employment practices;\nour ability to retain local managers and key employees who are important to the operations of an acquired business;\nthe attention required by our senior management and the management of an acquired business for integration efforts, which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers;\nour ability to effectively utilize new equipment that we acquire;\nthe implementation of our financial and management information systems, business practices and policies;\nour pursuit of multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously; and\nunforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.\nIn addition, potential acquisition targets may be in states in which we do not currently operate, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities and subject us to additional and unfamiliar legal requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve synergies and cost savings in connection with future acquisitions. Many of the businesses that we previously acquired, and businesses that we may acquire in the future, could have unaudited financial statements that are prepared by management and are not independently reviewed or audited, and such financial statements could be materially different if they were independently reviewed or audited. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations consistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete future acquisitions at all. We also cannot know whether there will be attractive acquisition opportunities at reasonable prices, that financing will be available or that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, our results of operations from these acquisitions could, in the future, result in impairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill or other long-lived assets, particularly if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly.\nWe may lose business to competitors that underbid us and may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nMost of our project awards are determined through a competitive bidding process in which price is the determining factor. Because of the high cost of transporting HMA, our ability to win a project award is often influenced by the distance between a work site and our HMA plants. We compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and are vertically integrated. As a result, our competitors may be able to bid at lower prices than we can due to the location of their plants or as a result of their size or vertical integration advantages. Government funding for public infrastructure projects is limited, contributing to competition for the limited number of public projects available. An increase in competition may result in a decrease in new project awards to us at acceptable profit margins. In addition, in the event of a downturn in private residential and commercial construction, the competition for available public infrastructure projects could intensify, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient bonding capacity, which could preclude us from bidding on certain projects.\nA significant number of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. Sureties typically issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and they can decline to do so at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition thereto. Our ability to obtain performance and payment bonds primarily depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise, reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Events that adversely affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult or costly to obtain in the future. If we are unable to obtain or renew a sufficient level of bonding, or if bonding costs were to increase, we may be precluded from bidding on certain projects or successfully contracting with certain customers, which could limit the aggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with such bonds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather and climate conditions, which can adversely impact our business.\nOur construction operations occur outdoors in an area of the country in which hurricanes, tornadoes and tropical storms are common and snow frequently occurs in certain markets in the winter. As a result, seasonal changes and adverse weather conditions, such as extended snowy, rainy or cold weather, can adversely affect our business operations through a decline in the use and production of HMA, a decline in the demand for our construction services, alterations and delays in our construction schedules, and reduced efficiencies in our contracting operations, resulting in under-utilization of crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Climate change may lead to increased extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, including natural disasters. Should the impact of climate change be significant or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and processes, which are subject to cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure that could be damaged or interrupted by a variety of factors. Any significant breach, breakdown, destruction or interruption of these systems has the potential to negatively affect our operations. We could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyber attack, such as the infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or through our third-party providers. Although we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Similarly, our suppliers rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage their businesses and, thus, are also at risk of, and may be impacted by, cybersecurity attacks. An interruption in the business operations of our suppliers and other third parties with which we do business resulting from a cybersecurity attack could indirectly impact our business operations.\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions.\nDesign-build contracts are used as a method of project delivery that provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally subcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission that causes damages, there is a risk that the subcontractor and/or its errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the full amount of the liability incurred. In this case, we may be responsible for the remaining liability, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into joint venture contracts to perform certain projects, and these arrangements expose us to certain risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control.\nFrom time to time, we perform construction projects as part of a joint venture, under which our relationship to the other joint venture partners is governed by a written contract. Participation in these arrangements exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including the risk that our partners may fail to perform under the contracts, which could subject us to contractual liability. In addition, if our partners are not able or willing to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or the joint venture arrangement is terminated, there could be unanticipated costs to complete the project, or we could be liable for financial penalties or liquidated damages. In the event that we are not the controlling partner in the joint venture, we may have limited control over the decisions made with respect to the project. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur continued success requires us to hire, train and retain qualified personnel and subcontractors in a competitive industry.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified, reliable personnel, including, but not limited to, our executive officers and key management personnel. In addition, we rely on engineers, project management personnel, other employees and qualified subcontractors who possess the necessary and required experience and expertise to perform their respective services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense, and it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the requisite expertise and within the time frame demanded by our customers. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire, train and retain qualified personnel. Also, it could be difficult to replace personnel who hold credentials that may be required to perform certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience.\nAs some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we must provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into vacant leadership roles and other key positions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects and our strategic plan may be adversely affected, the costs of executing both our existing and future projects may increase, and our financial performance may decline.\nIn addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases.\nLabor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs from time to time, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced material disruptions due to labor shortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to complete our construction projects according to the required schedule or otherwise efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers and increased fuel costs has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe depend on third parties for equipment and supplies essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease real property, plants and equipment to us and to provide us with supplies, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials necessary for our operations. The inability to purchase or lease the properties, plants or equipment that are necessary for our operations could severely impact our business. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers needs, or if our suppliers experience price increases or disruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages, financial or regulatory difficulties or distribution problems, our ability to bid for or complete contracts could be impaired, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nSupply chain issues, including shortages of raw materials needed for HMA production, equipment, vehicles and construction supplies, could increase our costs or cause delays in our ability to complete our projects, which could have an adverse impact on our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely on our supply chain for raw materials to manufacture HMA and for equipment, vehicles and construction supplies in order to complete our projects. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions due to shortages in global freight capacity, significant increases in the price of critical components and raw materials, a failure to appropriately forecast or adjust our requirements based on our business needs, a significant natural disaster or volatility in demand for our products and services could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Our vendors and subcontractors also may be unable to meet our demand, significantly increase lead times for deliveries or impose significant price increases that we are unable to offset through alternate sources of supply, price increases to our customers or increased productivity in our operations. In some cases, we procure certain inputs and services from single or limited suppliers or subcontractors. In the event of supply disruptions from these suppliers or subcontractors, we may not be able to diversify our resources for such materials or services in a timely manner or may experience quality issues with alternate sources. Our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in large part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials, plant components, equipment and vehicles from our suppliers, and significant disruptions in their supply could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.\nWe consume natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints and significant price fluctuations.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control, such as unavailability due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for petroleum-based products and other factors. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted if our suppliers are unable to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Additionally, increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products utilized in our operations, particularly increases following a bid based on lower costs for such products, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur contract backlog is subject to reductions in scope and cancellations and therefore could be an unreliable indicator of our future earnings.\nAt September 30, 2023, our contract backlog was $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2022. Our contract backlog generally consists of construction projects for which we either have an executed contract or commitment with a client or have submitted the currently lowest bid. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement. Moreover, our contract backlog reflects our expected revenues from the contract, commitment or bid, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenues and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as expected could have a negative impact on our results.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although we often require bonding or other forms of guarantees from our subcontractors, we are not always able to obtain such bonds or guarantees. In situations where we are unable to obtain a bond or guarantee, we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated. In addition, if the total costs of a project exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule-driven, and our failure to meet the schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or expose us to financial liability.\nIn some instances, including in the case of many of our fixed unit price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. Any failure to meet the contractual schedule or satisfy the completion requirements set forth in our contracts could subject us to responsibility for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages, liability for our customers actual costs arising out of our delay, reduced profits or a loss on that project and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAn inability to secure sufficient aggregates reserves could have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nStrict governmental regulations and the limited number of properties containing useful aggregates reserves have made it increasingly challenging and costly to obtain sufficient aggregates to support our business, both with respect to internal use and third-party sales. If we are unable to obtain adequate reserves to support our business, then our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nA failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy, and a majority of our contracts require us to maintain specific types and amounts of coverage. Although we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage and increased premium costs or deductibles. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we would be subject to increased out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim and we may not be able to procure certain contracts, either of which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified disadvantaged business enterprises to perform as subcontractors, which could cause us to breach certain contracts with governmental customers.\nSome of our contracts with governmental agencies contain minimum disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) participation clauses, which require us to maintain a requisite level of DBE participation. If we fail to obtain or maintain the required level of DBE participation, we could be held responsible for breach of contract. Such a breach could impair our ability to bid on future projects and could require us to pay monetary damages. To the extent that we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses, which could materially affect our business and reputation.\nBecause our employees and others are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical substances and dangerous manufacturing processes, our construction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces. Therefore, safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. We are often responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. In addition, many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also can increase employee turnover, which increases project costs and therefore our overall operating costs. If we fail to implement effective safety procedures, our employees could be injured, the completion of a project could be delayed, or we could be exposed to investigations and possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could also result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe could incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nWe provide our customers with products designed to comply with building codes or other regulatory requirements, as well as any applicable contractual specifications, including, but not limited to, with respect to durability, compressive strength and weight-bearing capacity. If our products do not satisfy these requirements and specifications, material claims may arise against us, our reputation could be damaged and, if any such claims are for an uninsured, non-indemnified or product-related matter, then resolution of such claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are, and may continue to be, involved in routine litigation and government inquiries in the ordinary course of business.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things, workers compensation claims, employment-related disputes and issues related to liability, breach of contract or tortious conduct in connection with our performance of services and provision of materials. We are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, although adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary course inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and public health and safety. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including requirements to obtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limitations on activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and assessments of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. For example, a number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed or are contemplating legislative and regulatory actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as monitoring, reporting and emissions control requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Because we emit greenhouse gases through the manufacture of HMA products and through the combustion of fossil fuels as part of our mining and road construction services, any such laws and regulations applicable to jurisdictions in which we operate could require us to incur costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or third-party facilities that receive waste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from our own actions or those of others and whether such actions complied with applicable laws at the time they were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties that we own, lease or operate could result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes. For example, our lease agreements associated with our aggregates facilities could, if not appropriately managed, subject us to specific reclamation obligations, costs, or liabilities for any contamination or regulatory violations arising from our mining operations.\nNumerous government authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Certain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of fault is required) or joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, compensatory damages, injunctive relief, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to our industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and, consequently, affecting profitability.\nClimate change and related laws and regulations could adversely affect us.\nThe potential impact of climate change on our operations and our customers remains uncertain. The primary risk that climate change poses to our business is the potential for increases in the volume, frequency and intensity of rainfall and tropical storms, which would impair our ability to perform our construction projects. Climate change could also lead to disruptions in our supply chain, thereby impairing our production capabilities, or the distribution of our products due to major storm events or prolonged adverse conditions, changing temperature levels or flooding from sea level changes, especially in our coastal markets. These changes could be severe and could negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, governmental initiatives to address climate change could, if\nadopted, restrict our operations, require us to make capital or other expenditures to comply with these initiatives, increase our costs, impact our ability to compete or negatively impact efforts to obtain permits, licenses and other approvals for existing and new facilities. Our inability to timely respond to the risks posed by climate change and the costs of compliance with climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us.\nIncreasing focus by stakeholders on environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and practices could result in additional costs and could adversely impact our reputation, investor perception, employee retention and willingness of third parties to do business with us.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing focus from stakeholders, including government agencies, investors, consumers and employees, on our ESG policies and practices. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies ESG practices continues to grow. If our policies and practices do not meet regulatory requirements or stakeholders evolving expectations for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, employee health and safety practices, director and employee diversity, human capital management and corporate governance, our reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and customers and suppliers may be unwilling to do business with us. In addition, we are subject to various federal and state laws in connection with our operations, and inconsistency in legislation and regulations among jurisdictions and expected additional regulations may require greater resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices. Any assessment of the potential impact of future ESG-related regulations or industry standards is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change where we operate. As a result, the effects of increased focus by stakeholders on ESG matters could have short- and long-term impacts on our business and operations.\nOur operations are subject to special hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses that may not be covered by insurance.\nOperating hazards inherent in our business, some of which may be outside of our control, can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, and environmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations. Our insurance policies are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to our deductible amounts are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, liabilities subject to insurance are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of unreported incidents and the effectiveness of our safety programs. If we experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we may be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than for maintaining or expanding our operations.\nOur failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities, harm our reputation with our customers and disrupt our operations.\nAlthough we take steps to verify the employment eligibility status of all of our employees, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that could make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. If we fail to comply with these laws, our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration laws, and, in some cases, our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure that our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws or to ensure compliance by our subcontractors could damage our reputation and may cause our customers to cancel contracts with us or to not award future business to us. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nFederal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and subject us to fines and lawsuits.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, the Family Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of the Department of Labor, regulations of state attorneys general, federal and state wage and hour laws, and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment-related matters. As our employees are located in a number of states, compliance with these evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business. In recent years, companies have been subject to\nlawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, overtime wage policies, discrimination and similar matters, some of which have resulted in the payment of meaningful damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits may be threatened or instituted against us from time to time, and we may incur damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. [We are currently subject to employee-related legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur debt consists primarily of our borrowings under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (successor in interest to BBVA USA) and certain other lenders party from time to time thereto (as amended, the Credit Agreement), which, as of September 30, 2023, provided for a $250.0 million term loan (the Term Loan), a $325.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) and a $50.0 million delayed draw term loan (the Delayed Draw Term Loan, and together with the Term Loan, the Term Loans). A significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Among other consequences, this level of indebtedness could:\nrequire us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the satisfaction of repayment obligations, and not for other purposes;\nlimit our ability to borrow money or issue equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\ncause our interest expense to increase if there is a general increase in interest rates, because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and future business opportunities;\ncause us to be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\nmake us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy; and\nlimit our ability to exploit business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets, including due to the recent bank failures as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve Banks actions and pace of interest rate increases to combat inflation in the United States, may further increase our interest payments. We have\nsecured overnight financing rate (SOFR)-based floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and has a limited history, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our variable rate indebtedness is difficult to predict.\nAlthough the Credit Agreement restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. This could reduce our ability to satisfy our current obligations and further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nThe Credit Agreement restricts our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, create liens on assets, change our or our subsidiaries fiscal year, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain restrictive agreements, engage in mergers or consolidations, participate in partnerships and joint ventures, sell assets, incur additional liens, pay dividends or distributions and make other restricted payments, make investments, loans or advances, repay or amend the terms of subordinated indebtedness, make acquisitions, enter into certain operating leases, enter into certain hedge transactions, amend material contracts and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio and contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will be entitled to accelerate amounts due thereunder and take other actions permitted to be taken by a secured\ncreditor. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives.\nOur ongoing ability to generate cash is important for funding our continuing operations, making acquisitions and servicing our indebtedness. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part on prevailing market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our Revolving Credit Facility may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make certain investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities or respond to competitive challenges, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be required to record an impairment charge if we determine that goodwill recorded in connection with prior acquisitions has become impaired, and this determination requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had $159.3 million and $129.5 million, respectively, of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually or more often if required. Our assessments involve a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subjective and require significant judgment regarding highly uncertain matters that are subject to change. The use of different assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination as to whether or not an impairment has occurred. In addition, if future events are less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in our impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting standards that we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require us to make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We make critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters, including with respect to revenue recognition, contracts receivable including retainage, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, accrued insurance costs and share-based payments and other equity transactions. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require us to make subjective and complex judgments. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues and profit. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different methods to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. For more information about our critical accounting policies and use of estimates, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nUnfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition and overall results of operations.\nActual events, concerns or speculation about disruption or instability in the banking and financial services industry, such as liquidity constraints, the failure of individual institutions, or the inability of individual institutions or the banking and financial service industry generally to meet their contractual obligations, could significantly impair our access to capital, delay access to deposits or other financial assets, or cause actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. Similarly, these events, concerns or speculation could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our customers, critical vendors and business partners also could be adversely affected by these risks as described above, which in turn could result in their committing a breach or default under their contractual agreements with us, their insolvency or bankruptcy, or other adverse effects. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources, or non-compliance of banking and financial services counterparties with their contractual commitments to us could, among other risks, have material adverse impacts on our ability to meet our operating expenses and other financial needs, could result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations and could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nForce majeure events, such as natural disasters, pandemics and terrorist attacks, and unexpected equipment failures could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, pandemics or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which we operate. As an example, from time to time, we face unexpected severe weather conditions, evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, increased labor and material costs or shortages, inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. We seek to include language in our contracts with private customers that grants us certain relief in connection with force majeure events, and we attempt to mitigate the potential impact arising from force majeure events in both public and private customer contracts. However, the extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our customers, and we remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events, subject to any relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. Additionally, our manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, such as our HMA plants. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage and cause us to lose revenues due to lost production time. These force majeure events and unexpected equipment failures may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues, production capability and ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial condition.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with our financial reporting and corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and rules implemented by the SEC. For example, as a publicly traded company, we are required to adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal control over financial reporting. These rules and regulations have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have designed and implemented a number of internal controls and other remedial measures that we believe will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline and impact our liquidity, perceived creditworthiness and ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs related to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404). If we are unable to timely comply with such requirements, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404, which requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls. The out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of managements attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 have been significant, and we expect to continue to incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance efforts. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our auditors identify and report any material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, which limits the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of November 27, 2023, our outstanding Class B common stock represented approximately 67.3% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. The shares of Class B common stock are beneficially owned primarily by (i) SunTx Capital Partners, a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas (SunTx), and funds that it manages, (ii) SunTx principals and their respective affiliates and family members, and (iii) certain members of management and our board of directors. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or precludes the ability of holders of Class A common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Future transfers of shares of our Class B common stock generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, with limited exceptions. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of each remaining share of Class B common stock.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of Class A common stock by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.\nAs of November 27, 2023, we had outstanding a total of 43,711,058 shares of our Class A common stock and 8,998,511 shares of our Class B common stock that are convertible at any time into an equal number of shares of our Class A common stock. The sale of shares of our Class A common stock, or the perception of future sales by us or our existing stockholders, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with offerings or acquisitions, and the number of shares issued or issuable thereafter could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Any such issuance would result in dilution to holders of our Class A common stock.\nSunTx, together with its principals and their respective affiliates and family members (collectively, the SunTx Group), controls us, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAs of November 27, 2023, the SunTx Group beneficially owned approximately 2.0% of our outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 76.3% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 52.0% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, the SunTx Group has the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our Class A common stock, our ability to incur or issue debt, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and our entry into extraordinary transactions. This concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in related party transactions involving the SunTx Group and certain companies controlled by its members. As a result, the interests of the SunTx Group may not in all cases be aligned with your interests.\nIn addition, the SunTx Group may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, the SunTx Group could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. SunTx is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of SunTx, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The SunTx Group also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nSo long as the SunTx Group continues to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, it will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions, even if the number of shares of outstanding Class B common stock is limited in proportion to the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Shares of our Class B common stock may be transferred to an unrelated third party if holders of a majority of the shares of our Class B common stock owned by SunTx and its affiliates consent to such transfer in writing in advance.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our governing documents and Delaware corporate law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our Company, which could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our Company difficult, including:\na dual class common stock structure, which currently provides the SunTx Group and the other holders of our Class B common stock with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, so long as they continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, even if they own significantly less than 50% of the total number of shares of our outstanding common stock;\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\nthe ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws;\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors or amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our Class A common stock.\nOur governing documents designate certain courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any: (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and that if any action specified above is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (b) having service of process made upon such claiming party by service upon such claiming partys counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). These provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to\nfind these provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we are a controlled company under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the rules of the SEC, our stockholders do not have, and may never have, certain corporate governance protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nThe SunTx Group controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a controlled company under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and SEC rules. As a controlled company, we are not required to comply with certain provisions requiring that (i) a majority of our directors be independent, (ii) the compensation of our executives be determined by independent directors or (iii) nominees for election to our board of directors be selected by independent directors. Because we intend to continue to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, our stockholders may not have the protections that these rules are intended to provide. Our status as a controlled company could cause our Class A common stock to be less attractive to certain investors or otherwise reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the Credit Agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal executive office is located in Dothan, Alabama, in a building that we own. As of September 30, 2023, we operated (i) 67 HMA plants in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, (ii) 13 aggregates facilities in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, and (iii) two liquid asphalt terminals in Alabama and Florida. Our HMA plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on market conditions. We maintain offices at our HMA plants and aggregates facilities as we determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. We consider our plants and other physical properties, whether owned or leased, to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of our business. However, we routinely evaluate the purchase or lease of additional properties or the consolidation of our properties as our business needs change.\nThe table below summarizes the locations and the nature of our ownership or leasehold interest in each of our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and liquid asphalt terminals as of September 30, 2023.\nHMA Plants Aggregates Facilities Liquid Asphalt Terminals\nLocation Owned Leased Owned Leased Owned Leased\nAlabama 10 7 6 3 1 -\nFlorida 10 1 1 - 1 -\nGeorgia 6 1 1 2 - -\nNorth Carolina 12 10 - - - -\nSouth Carolina 4 3 - - - -\nTennessee - 3 - - - - Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things, (i) workers compensation claims, (ii) employment-related disputes and (iii) liability issues or breach of contract or tortious conduct claims in connection with the performance of services and provision of materials. We and our affiliates are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. In the opinion of our management, after consultation with legal counsel, none of the pending inquiries, litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nThe information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 C.F.R. Part 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this report.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nFrom our inception until April 2018, we maintained a single class of common stock. On April 23, 2018, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to effectuate a dual-class equity structure, which resulted in the conversion of each share of our then-outstanding common stock into 25.2 shares of Class B common stock and the initial authorization of Class A common stock for issuance.\nMarket for Our Common Stock\nOur Class A common stock is listed and trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ROAD. Prior to its listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 4, 2018, there was no established public trading market for our Class A common stock. There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.\nHolders\nAs of November 27, 2023, there were 43,711,058 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, held by 99 stockholders of record. The actual number of beneficial holders of our Class A common stock is significantly greater than the number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held by banks, brokers and other nominees. The last sale price for a share of our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 27, 2023 was $43.30.\nAs of November 27, 2023, there were 8,998,511 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, held by 36 stockholders of record.\nDividends\nHolders of our Class A and Class B common stock receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. We do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the terms of the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock unless, after giving effect to such dividend, we would remain in compliance with the financial covenants and, at the time any such dividend is made, no default or event of default exists or would result from the payment of such dividend.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not sell any of our equity securities during the period covered by this report that were not registered under the Securities Act.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we did not purchase any of our equity securities that are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative five-year total return provided to the Companys Class A common stock holders relative to the cumulative total returns of the NASDAQ Composite index and the Dow Jones U.S. Heavy Construction index. The graph tracks the performance of a $100 investment in our Class A common stock and in each index (with the reinvestment of all dividends) from September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2023.\nValue as of September 30,\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nConstruction Partners, Inc. $100.00 $128.76 $150.41 $275.79 $216.78 $302.15\nNASDAQ Composite Index $100.00 $99.42 $138.79 $179.57 $131.43 $164.29\nDow Jones US Heavy Construction Index $100.00 $97.52 $94.70 $162.83 $175.64 $226.32\nThe information under the heading Stock Performance Graph shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into such filing. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the headings Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In this discussion, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the building and maintenance of transportation networks. Our operations leverage a highly-skilled workforce, strategically located HMA plants, substantial construction assets and select material deposits. We provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States.\nOur public projects are funded by federal, state and local governments and include roads, highways, bridges, airports and other forms of infrastructure. Public transportation infrastructure projects historically have been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets and represent a significant share of the United States construction market. Federal funds are allocated on a state-by-state basis, and each state is required to match a portion of the federal funds that it receives. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenues from fuel taxes and other user fees.\nIn addition to public infrastructure projects, we provide a wide range of large site work construction and HMA paving services to private construction customers, including commercial and residential developers and local businesses.\nFiscal 2023 Developments\nContract Backlog\nAt September 30, 2023, our contract backlog was $1.6 billion. Contract backlog is a financial measure that reflects the dollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in the future. We include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Our backlog consists of uncompleted work on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not commenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include (i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of uncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet begun was $1.3 billion at September 30, 2023. Our contract backlog also includes low bid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private work projects for which we have been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog was $0.3 billion at September 30, 2023.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, we completed five acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. As a result of these acquisitions, we added eight asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction professionals. For further discussion regarding these transactions, see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInflationary and Supply Chain Trends\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we continued to experience an upward trend in certain inflation-sensitive inputs for our products and services, including upward pressure on wages and increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce HMA, such as liquid asphalt and aggregate materials. We also experienced some disruptions from subcontractors, materials suppliers, equipment manufacturers and others in our supply chain, although to a lesser extent than in recent years. We have been able to mitigate some of the effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor constraints on our business by increasing prices for our products and including the anticipated cost increases in the construction projects we bid. However, we are limited in our ability to pass through increased costs for projects already in our backlog and, under those circumstances, may be unable to recoup losses or diminished profit margins by passing these costs through to our customers.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher activity and revenues during the second half of our fiscal year. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our third fiscal quarter varies greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenues in the third fiscal quarter, while a warm, dry spring may facilitate earlier project commencement dates.\nHow We Assess Performance of Our Business\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues predominantly by providing construction products and services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States. Our projects represent a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. We also derive revenues from the sale of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement to customers. We recognize revenues derived from projects as we satisfy our performance obligations over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Revenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement are recognized when the risks associated with ownership have passed to the customer.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists of all direct and indirect costs associated with construction contracts, including raw materials, labor, equipment costs, depreciation, lease expenses, subcontract costs and other expenses at our HMA plants, aggregates mining facilities and liquid asphalt cement terminal. Our cost of revenues is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, primarily liquid asphalt and diesel fuel. From time to time, when appropriate, we limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into forward purchase commitments. In addition, our public infrastructure contracts often provide for price adjustments based on fluctuations in certain commodity-related product costs. These price adjustment provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar provisions in our private contracts.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Accretion and Amortization\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired as a business combination, at fair value. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements, intangible assets and liabilities. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term. Our intangible assets and liabilities were recognized as a result of certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities. Mineral reserves are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate offices. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial employees. General and administrative expenses also include acquisition expenses, audit, consulting and professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, travel, insurance, office space rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nGain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn the normal course of business, we sell construction equipment for various reasons, including when the cost of maintaining the asset exceeds the cost of replacing it. The gain or loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment reflects the difference between the carrying value at the date of disposal and the net consideration received from the sale of equipment during the period.\nGain on Facility Exchange\nAs part of our continued growth strategy, we may exchange or sell facilities in order to generate capital for use in connection with other strategic initiatives. The gain or loss on the exchange or sale of a facility reflects the difference between the net carrying value of the facility at the date of disposal and the consideration received from the exchange or sale during the period.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net primarily represents interest incurred on our long-term debt, such as the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the changes in fair values of interest swap agreements and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. These amounts are partially offset by interest income earned on short-term investments of cash balances in excess of our current operating needs.\nOther Key Performance Indicators - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before, as applicable from time to time, (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, (iv) equity-based compensation expense, (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt, and (vi) certain management fees and expenses. Periods commencing subsequent to September 30, 2023 will not include an adjustment for management fees and expenses, which have historically related to our management services agreement with an affiliate of SunTx. Effective October 1, 2023, the term of the management services agreement was extended to October 1, 2028. As a result of the term extension, we no longer view the management fees and expenses paid under the management services agreement as a non-recurring expense. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate companies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. Potential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nFor the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30,\n2023 2022\nNet income $ 49,001 $ 21,376\nInterest expense, net 17,346 7,701\nProvision for income taxes 16,403 6,915\nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization 79,100 65,730\nEquity-based compensation expense 10,759 8,000\nManagement fees and expenses (1)\n1,486 1,451\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 174,095 $ 111,173\nRevenues $ 1,563,548 $ 1,301,674\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 11.1 % 8.5 %\n(1)Reflects fees and reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses under a management services agreement with SunTx (see Note 17 - Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report).\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023) and September 30, 2022 (fiscal 2022) (in thousands, except percentages). Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on November 22, 2022, for a discussion of results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021) and a comparison of our financial results for fiscal 2022 to those for fiscal 2021.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, Change from Fiscal\n2022 to Fiscal 2023\n2023 2022\nDollars % of\nRevenues Dollars % of\nRevenues $ Change %\nChange\nRevenues $ 1,563,548 100.0 % $ 1,301,674 100.0 % $ 261,874 20.1 %\nCost of revenues 1,367,163 87.4 % 1,162,372 89.3 % 204,791 17.6 %\nGross profit 196,385 12.6 % 139,302 10.7 % 57,083 41.0 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses (126,947) (8.1) % (107,562) (8.3) % (19,385) 18.0 %\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment 7,048 0.5 % 3,673 0.3 % 3,375 91.9 %\nGain on facility exchange 5,389 0.3 % - - % 5,389 - %\nOperating income 81,875 5.3 % 35,413 2.7 % 46,462 131.2 %\nInterest expense, net (17,346) (1.1) % (7,701) (0.6) % (9,645) 125.2 %\nOther income 875 - % 600 0.1 % 275 45.8 %\nIncome before provision for income taxes and earnings from investment in joint venture 65,404 4.2 % 28,312 2.2 % 37,092 131.0 %\nProvision for income taxes 16,403 1.1 % 6,915 0.5 % 9,488 137.2 %\nEarnings (loss) from investment in\njoint venture - - % (21) (0.1) % 21 (100.0) %\nNet income $ 49,001 3.1 % $ 21,376 1.6 % $ 27,625 129.2 %\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 174,095 11.1 % $ 111,173 8.5 % $ 62,922 56.6 %\nRevenues. Revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $261.9 million, or 20.1%, to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion for fiscal 2022. The increase included $148.5 million of revenues attributable to acquisitions completed during or subsequent to fiscal 2022 and an increase of approximately $113.4 million of revenues in our remaining markets from contract work and sales of HMA and aggregates to third parties. The 8.7% increase in revenue in our existing markets was due to strong demand in both public and private work.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2023 increased $57.1 million, or 41.0%, to $196.4 million from $139.3 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the 20.1% increase in revenues for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 and a higher gross profit margin. The higher gross profit margin was due to (i) efficient utilization of our plants and equipment fleet and (ii) completion of new backlog with more favorable margins.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 increased $19.4 million, or 18.0%, to $126.9 million from $107.6 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was the result of (i) a $7.7 million increase attributable to general and administrative expenses associated with the operations of businesses acquired subsequent to September 30, 2022, (ii) a $6.4 million increase in management personnel payroll and benefits, (iii) a $2.8 million increase in equity-based compensation expense, and (iv) a $2.5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.\nGain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment. Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2023 increased $3.4 million, or 91.9%, to $7.0 million from $3.7 million for fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily the result of a $1.3 million gain on the sale of an excess office building and higher disposals of equipment and components during fiscal 2023.\nGain on Facility Exchange. Gain on facility exchange for fiscal 2023 was $5.4 million compared to $0.0 million for fiscal 2022. The gain was the result of the disposition of a quarry in North Carolina. In connection with this transaction, we acquired three HMA manufacturing plants and certain related assets located in the Nashville, Tennessee metro area.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2023 increased $9.6 million, or 125.2%, to $17.3 million compared to $7.7 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to an increase in the average principal debt balance outstanding and higher interest rates during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate increased to 25.1% for fiscal 2023, from 24.4% for fiscal 2022. Our higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was due to differences in state tax rates at our operating subsidiaries.\nNet Income. Net income increased $27.6 million, or 129.2%, to $49.0 million for fiscal 2023 compared to $21.4 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in net income was primarily a result of higher gross profit, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment and gain on facility exchange, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense, net, all as described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were $174.1 million and 11.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2023, compared to $111.2 million and 8.5%, respectively, for fiscal 2022. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin resulted from an increase in gross profit, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment and gain on facility exchange, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses, all as described above. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as well as a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see How We Assess Performance of Our Business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows Analysis\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions $ 157,157 $ 16,498\nNet cash used in investing activities (143,372) (197,326)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (264) 159,136\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 13,521 $ (21,692)\nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $157.2 million, primarily as a result of:\nnet income of $49.0 million, reflecting $79.1 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, deferred income taxes of $11.2 million, equity-based compensation expense of $10.8 million, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment of $7.0 million, gain on facility exchange of $5.4 million;\nan increase in contracts receivable including retainage of $26.0 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;\nan increase in inventories of $7.3 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our inventory cycle;\na decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million, primarily due to the timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;\nan increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $19.6 million due to an increase in construction activity; and\na net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $26.7 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $16.5 million, primarily as a result of:\nnet income of $21.4 million, reflecting $65.7 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, equity-based compensation expense of $8.0 million and unrealized gains on derivative instruments of $0.4 million;\nan increase in contracts receivable including retainage, net of $97.1 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;\nan increase in inventories of $17.5 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our inventory cycle;\nan increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.9 million primarily due to the timing of deposits for federal and state income taxes and timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;\nan increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $29.8 million due to an increase in construction activity; and\na net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of $9.5 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash used in investing activities was $143.4 million, of which $91.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $97.8 million was invested in property, plant and equipment and $11.4 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $17.7 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment, $37.0 million of proceeds from the facility exchange and $2.9 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash used in investing activities was $197.3 million, of which $128.6 million related to acquisitions completed in the period and $68.9 million was invested in property, plant and equipment. These amounts were partially offset by $7.5 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million. We received $103.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, which was offset by $103.1 million of principal payments on long-term debt and purchase of treasury stock of $0.2 million.\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $159.1 million. We received $167.3 million in proceeds on long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, which was partially offset by $8.1 million of principal payments on long-term debt.\nCredit Agreement\nWe and each of our subsidiaries are parties to the Credit Agreement, which provides for the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had $283.8 million and $271.9 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loans, $93.1 million and $105.1 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $221.1 million and $208.6 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility, including reduction for outstanding letters of credit. The obligations of our subsidiaries under the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets.\nThe Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.56-to-1.00 and 2.56-to-1.00, respectively, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.72-to-1.00 and 2.79-to-1.00, respectively.\nFrom time to time, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate notional value of these interest rate swap agreements was $300.0 million, and the fair value was $26.9 million and $24.7 million, respectively, which is included within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor more information about the Credit Agreement, see Note 11 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nDuring fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures were approximately $97.8 million and $68.9 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures are typically made during the same fiscal year in which they are approved. At September 30, 2023, our commitments for capital expenditures were not material to our financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated basis. For fiscal 2024, we expect total capital expenditures to be $90.0 million to $95.0 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is subject to change.\nHistorically, we have required significant amounts of cash in order to make capital expenditures, purchase materials and fund our organic expansion into new markets. Our working capital needs are driven by the seasonality and growth of our business, with our cash requirements increasing in periods of growth. Additional cash requirements resulting from our growth include the costs of additional personnel, production and distribution facilities, enhancements to our information systems, integration costs related to any acquisitions and our compliance with laws and rules applicable to public companies.\nWe have historically relied on cash available through credit facilities, in addition to cash from operations, to finance our working capital requirements and to support our growth. We regularly monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt markets, in an effort to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to access outside sources of capital.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the potential impacts of inflation and supply chain constraints, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to conduct our operations. There can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide sufficient cash to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In the event that we make one or more acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount of cash on hand we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital, we may do so through borrowings under the Credit Agreement, joint ventures, asset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. However, our ability to engage in any such transactions may be constrained by economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain the funds we need, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $9.8 million, future purchase commitments for diesel fuel and natural gas of $3.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and $2.5 million of minimum royalty payments related to mineral leases at aggregates facilities. Other than the letters of credit, future purchase commitments and minimum royalty payments, we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2023 (in thousands).\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\nTotal 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 and Thereafter\nDebt obligations $ 376,850 $ 15,000 $ 18,750 $ 22,500 $ 320,600 $ - $ -\nOperating leases 17,269 2,793 2,389 2,240 2,018 1,712 6,117\nPurchase commitments 3,675 3,139 536 - - - -\nRoyalty payments 2,538 295 256 192 180 145 1,470\nAsset retirement obligations 2,417 - - - - - 2,417\nTotal $ 402,749 $ 21,227 $ 21,931 $ 24,932 $ 322,798 $ 1,857 $ 10,004\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those policies that, in managements view, are the most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. The notes to the consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are discussed further below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). Our private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Revenues from fixed unit price and fixed total price construction contracts are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Under this method, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs. This cost-to-cost method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract without adding new provisions or terms. Change orders may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Either we or our customers may initiate change orders. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have a change of scope for which we believe we are contractually entitled to a higher price, but where a price change associated with the scope change has not yet been agreed upon with the customer. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenues equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers. Change orders that are unapproved as to both price and scope are evaluated as claims. We consider claims to be amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our customers or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Claims are included in the calculation of revenues when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. To support these requirements, the existence of the following items must be satisfied: (i) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim or a legal opinion has been obtained, stating that, under the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis to support the claim; (ii) additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance; (iii) costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed; and (iv) the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable, not based on managements subjective evaluation of the situation or on unsupported representations. Revenues in excess of contract costs incurred on claims are recognized when an agreement is reached with the customer as to the value of the claim, which, in some instances, may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred.\nFor the majority of our contracts, upon completion and final acceptance of the services that we were contracted to perform, we receive our final payment upon completion of the necessary contract closing documents, and our obligations to the owner are complete at that\npoint. The accuracy of our revenues and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts. Our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach. However, our projects can be highly complex and, in almost every case, the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid. Because we have a large number of projects of varying sizes and levels of complexity in process at any given time, these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability. However, large changes in revenues or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability.\nThe accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our projects use a detailed approach, and we believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include:\nthe completeness and accuracy of the original bid;\ncosts associated with scope changes;\nchanges in costs of labor and/or materials;\nextended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays;\nsubcontractor performance issues;\nchanges in productivity expectations;\nsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\nchanges from original design on design-build projects;\nthe availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;\na change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials;\nour ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and\nthe customers ability to properly administer the contract.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins, may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods, and these fluctuations may be significant.\nContracts Receivable, Including Retainage, Net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed to the customer and currently due in accordance with our contracts. Many of the contracts under which we perform work contain retainage provisions. Retainage refers to amounts that we have billed to the customer and the Company has an unconditional right to payment, but are being held for payment by the customer pending satisfactory completion of the project. Retainage on active contracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, contracts receivable included $53.3 million and $44.3 million, respectively, of retainage, which was being contractually withheld by customers until satisfactory completion of the associated contracts.\nBecause the majority of our construction contracts are entered into with federal, state or municipal government customers, credit risk is minimal. We confirm that funds have been appropriated by the government project owner prior to commencing work on such projects. While most of our public contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government entity, in the event of any such termination, we are entitled to receive the contract price for completed work and reimbursement of termination-related costs. Credit risk with private owners is minimized because of statutory mechanics liens, which give us high priority in the event of lien foreclosures following financial difficulties of private owners. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which has historically been sufficient to cover accounts that are not collected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets, such as goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management, and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a material impairment of our long-lived assets.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. We performed our most recent annual impairment test on July 1, 2023. Our test indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. For our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate our market capitalization compared to the net assets of the Company overall. Our final determination of valuation is impacted by a number of factors, but the key factors are the price of our common stock, recently completed transactions from both public companies and private transactions and our estimated forecast of future cash flows.\nThe valuation approaches contain uncertainty regarding the estimates used. Our market capitalization could be impacted because we are a controlled company, which impacts the control premium we apply to the market price of our common stock. One of the largest uncertainties relates to federal, state and local government spending, which management expects to increase in the upcoming years. There are a number of other uncertainties with respect to our future financial performance that could impact estimated future cash flows, including those discussed under the heading Risk Factors elsewhere in this report. Based on our valuation approaches, we determined that our one reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired at July 1, 2023 or 2022. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had goodwill with a carrying amount of $159.3 million and $129.5 million, respectively.\nFor our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was determined that is more likely than not the indefinite-lived name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.\nInventories\nThe Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of inventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to customers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including asphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled $75.5 million and $64.8 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $8.5 million and $9.4 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and, where necessary, establish a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nTo assess this likelihood, we use historical three-year results of operations, estimates and judgments regarding our future taxable income and consider the jurisdiction in which the taxable income is generated to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, results of operations, actual and forecasted results, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Additionally, we record uncertain tax positions at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOn the basis of our evaluations, at September 30, 2023 and 2022, no valuation allowance was recorded on our net deferred tax assets, and we had no material uncertain tax positions. If our estimates or assumptions regarding our current and deferred tax items are inaccurate or are modified, these changes could have potentially material impacts on our earnings.\nAccrued Insurance Cost\nWe carry insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation, under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, the Captive has retained the first $1,000,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. Also effective October 1, 2021, we became a member of a group captive insurance company that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. We utilize various\nprimary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims in excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on our operating results and financial position up to $1,000,000 per occurrence for general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation claims. Prior to October 1, 2021, the amount for which we were liable for general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation claims ranged from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence. Management accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified, if necessary, by recent events.\nWe provide employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company. Under the self-insured policies, we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. We purchase separate stop-loss insurance, which limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $160,000.\nShare-Based Payments and Other Equity Transactions\nOur equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. We account for awards issued under our equity incentive plan using a fair value-based method of accounting, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is typically the vesting period. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy, including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates and asphalt paving mix production, natural gas for HMA production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production-related mobile equipment. In order to manage or reduce commodity price risk, we monitor the costs of these commodities at the time of bid and price them into our contracts accordingly. Furthermore, liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our public contracts, and in some of our private and commercial contracts, limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity. In addition, we enter into various firm purchase commitments, with terms generally less than 18 months, for certain raw materials.\nOur risk management activities also include the use of financial derivative instruments. We have entered into fuel swap and natural gas swap contracts to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not enter into commodity swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. These fuel swap and natural gas swap contracts provide a fixed price for less than 50% of our estimated fuel and natural gas usage for fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\nThe table below provides information about the Companys fuel swap and natural gas swap contracts that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices as of September 30, 2023.\nCarrying Amount Fair Value\nFuel swap contracts (1)\nContract volumes (1,000 gallons) 378\nWeighted average price (per gallon) 2.71\nContract amount (in thousands) $ 204 $ 204\nNatural gas swap contracts (1)\nContract volumes (1,000 MMBTU) 10\nWeighted average price (per MMBTU) 4.74\nContract amount (in thousands) $ (20) $ (20)\n(1)See also Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Investments in Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short- and long-term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions. We have SOFR-based floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments as hedges against the impact\nof interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. We do not enter into such derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had a total of $376.9 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. Holding other factors constant and absent the interest rate swap agreements described above, a hypothetical 1% change in our borrowing rates would result in a $3.8 million change in our annual interest expense based on our variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2023. The notional amount of the Companys outstanding interest rate swap contract at September 30, 2023 was $300.0 million. The maturity date of this swap is June 30, 2027, and the fair value of the outstanding swap contract was $26.9 million as of September 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents the future principal payment obligations, interest payments, and fair values associated with the Companys debt instruments assuming the Companys actual level of variable rate debt as of September 30, 2023 (in thousands).\nFor the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, Fair\n2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Value\nDebt obligations\nTerm loan $ 15,000 $ 18,750 $ 22,500 $ 227,500 $ - $ 283,750 $ 283,750\nRevolving credit facility - - - 93,100 - 93,100 93,100\nInterest payments (1)\n25,726 24,654 23,192 16,371 -\n(1) Represents projected interest payments using the Companys September 2023 SOFR-based floating rate of 6.93%.\nSee also Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Investments in Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nInflation Risk\nWe are subject to the effects of inflation through wage pressures, increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce HMA, and increases in other items, such as fuel, concrete and steel. In recent years, inflation, supply chain and upward wage pressures have had a significant impact on the global economy, including the construction industry in the United States. While it is impossible to fully eliminate the impact of these factors, we seek to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products or by including the anticipated price increases in our bids. Due to the relatively short-term duration of our construction contracts, we are generally able to reduce our exposure to price increases on new contracts, but we are limited in our ability to pass through increased costs for projects already in our backlog. Going forward, continued cost inflation in these areas may require further price adjustments to maintain profit margin, and any price increases may have a negative effect on demand. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 49)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Construction Partners, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee of the board of directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue Recognized Over Time Under Uncompleted Long-Term Construction Contracts\nAs described in Note 6, the Company has recognized $2,025,866,000 of costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2023. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue derived from long-term construction contracts over time as the Company satisfies the single performance obligation for each construction contract. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation in each long-term construction project is estimated using the input method, which is measured by the relationship of total costs incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost input method). Recognition of revenue under uncompleted construction contracts requires significant judgment by management, including measuring progress towards completion of the contract by estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete a contract.\nWe have identified the revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts that were uncompleted at September 30, 2023, as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes in determining the amount of revenue to recognize prior to completion of a contract. Auditing managements judgments related to measuring progress towards completion of the Companys contracts through estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete the contracts involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort.\nOur audit procedures related to revenue recognized under uncompleted long-term construction contracts included the following, among others:\nWe obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including managements controls over the estimation of total contract costs to be incurred in order to complete uncompleted contracts.\nWe selected a sample of long-term construction contracts and we performed the following:\n-Compared the current year costs incurred to prior year estimates of costs to complete, which involved comparing projects completed during the fiscal year with the estimates made as of the previous balance sheet date to evaluate managements ability to accurately estimate costs to complete on its long-term construction contracts.\n-Analyzed the estimated gross margins for uncompleted contracts by comparing the Companys three-year historical average gross margin stratified by customer type to the estimated margin for uncompleted contracts at fiscal year-end.\n-Inquired with individuals outside of the accounting function, including project management teams and individuals responsible for oversight and performance of the contracts, to obtain corroborating evidence regarding estimates of costs to complete and estimated gross margins on uncompleted contracts.\nCompared the costs incurred during the month immediately subsequent to the fiscal year end to costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2023, and on a sample basis, inquired with individuals responsible for oversight and performance of the contracts in order to obtain corroborating evidence regarding estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.\nBirmingham, Alabama\nNovember 29, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Construction Partners, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Construction Partners, Inc., and its subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nAs described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Ferebee Corporation from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company on December 1, 2022. We have also excluded Ferebee Corporation from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Ferebee Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets (excluding goodwill which was included within the scope of managements assessment), revenues and net income represent approximately 5%, 3% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nBirmingham, Alabama\nNovember 29, 2023\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 48,243 $ 35,531\nRestricted cash 837 28\nContracts receivable including retainage, net 303,704 265,207\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 27,296 29,271\nInventories 84,038 74,195\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 9,306 12,957\nTotal current assets 473,424 417,189\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 505,095 481,412\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 14,485 13,985\nGoodwill 159,270 129,465\nIntangible assets, net 19,520 15,976\nInvestment in joint venture 87 87\nRestricted investments 15,079 6,866\nOther assets 32,705 30,541\nTotal assets $ 1,219,665 $ 1,095,521\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 151,406 $ 130,468\nBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 78,905 52,477\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 2,338 2,209\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt 15,000 12,500\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 31,534 28,484\nTotal current liabilities 279,183 226,138\nLong-term liabilities:\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities and deferred debt issuance costs 360,740 363,066\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion 12,649 12,059\nDeferred income taxes, net 37,121 26,713\nOther long-term liabilities 13,398 11,666\nTotal long-term liabilities 423,908 413,504\nTotal liabilities 703,091 639,642\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders Equity:\nPreferred stock, par value $0.001; 10,000,000 shares authorized at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 and no shares issued and outstanding\n- -\nClass A common stock, par value $0.001; 400,000,000 shares authorized, 43,760,546 shares issued and 43,727,680 shares outstanding at September 30, 2023, and 41,195,730 shares issued and 41,193,024 shares outstanding at September 30, 2022\n44 41\nClass B common stock, par value $0.001; 100,000,000 shares authorized, 11,921,463 shares issued and 8,998,511 shares outstanding at September 30, 2023, and 14,275,867 shares issued and 11,352,915 shares outstanding at September 30, 2022\n12 15\nAdditional paid-in capital 267,330 256,571\nTreasury stock, Class A common stock, par value $0.001, at cost, 32,866 shares at September 30, 2023, and 2,706 shares at September 30, 2022\n(178) (39)\nTreasury stock, Class B common stock, par value $0.001, at cost, 2,922,952 shares at September 30, 2023 and 2022\n(15,603) (15,603)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income, net 18,694 17,620\nRetained earnings 246,275 197,274\nTotal stockholders equity 516,574 455,879\nTotal liabilities and stockholders equity $ 1,219,665 $ 1,095,521\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues $ 1,563,548 $ 1,301,674 $ 910,739\nCost of revenues 1,367,163 1,162,372 790,803\nGross profit 196,385 139,302 119,936\nGeneral and administrative expenses (126,947) (107,562) (91,878)\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment 7,048 3,673 2,043\nGain on facility exchange 5,389 -

(the Company) is a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. The Companys primary operations consist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (HMA) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates, such as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nThe Company was formed in 2007 by SunTx Capital Partners (SunTx), a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas, as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction industry.\nManagements Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for items such as recognition of revenues and cost of revenues, investments, mineral reserves, goodwill and other intangible assets, business acquisitions, valuation of operating lease right-of-use assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation allowances related to income taxes, accruals for potential liabilities related to lawsuits or insurance claims, asset retirement obligations, valuation of derivative instruments and valuation of equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are continually evaluated based on historical information and actual experience; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists principally of currency on hand and demand deposits at commercial banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid securities that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Cash equivalents include securities with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains demand accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit at several banks. From time to time, account balances have exceeded the maximum available federal deposit insurance coverage limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and regularly monitors its credit risk.\nRestricted Cash\nConstruction Partners Risk Management, Inc. (the Captive), a captive insurance company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries. Restricted cash represents cash held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the payment of casualty insurance claims. The Company had restricted cash of $0.8 million and $0.0 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRestricted Investments\nThe Companys restricted investments consist of debt securities, which are held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the payment of casualty insurance claims. The Company determines the classification of its securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified securities held by the Captive as available-for-sale. As a result, these securities are carried at their fair value. Purchases and sales of debt securities are recorded on the trade date. Interest income on debt securities is recorded when earned using an effective yield method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net. These securities have been classified as non-current assets based on their respective maturity dates and the Companys intent to reinvest sales proceeds into new restricted investments. The Company had restricted investments of $15.1 million and $6.9 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities quarterly to determine whether there has been a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost due to credit losses or other factors. This evaluation process entails judgement by the Company, and considers factors including the issuers financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic conditions, interest rate changes and changes in the rating of the security. When the Company has determined that it intends to sell, or that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before it recovers its amortized cost basis above fair value, the individual security is written down to fair value, with a corresponding charge to Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the intent impairment criteria but for which the Company has determined that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss allowance is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no intent impairments or credit losses.\nContracts Receivable Including Retainage, Net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled, and amounts retained by customers pending satisfactory completion of a project. It is common in the Companys industry for a small portion of either progress billings or the contract price, typically 10%, to be withheld by the customer until the Company completes a project to the satisfaction of the customer in accordance with the applicable contract terms. Such amounts, defined as retainage, are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Contracts receivable including retainage, net. Based on the Companys experience with similar contracts in recent years, billings for such retainage balances are generally collected within one year of the completion of the project.\nContracts receivable including retainage, net is stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for uncollectible accounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts, type of service performed, current economic conditions, historical losses and other information available to management. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and an adjustment to the contract receivable.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nBilling practices for the Companys contracts are governed by the contract terms of each project based on (i) progress toward completion approved by the owner, (ii) achievement of milestones or (iii) pre-agreed schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost input method. The Company records contract assets and contract liabilities to account for these differences in timing.\nThe contract asset, Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, arises when the Company recognizes revenues for services performed under its construction projects, but the Company is not yet entitled to bill the customer under the terms of the contract. Amounts billed to customers are excluded from this asset and reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Contracts receivable including retainage, net. Included in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are amounts the Company seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for (i) errors, (ii) changes in contract specifications or design, (iii) contract change orders in dispute, unapproved as to scope and price, or (iv) other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (such as claims). Such amounts are recorded to the extent that the amount can be reasonably estimated and recovery is probable. Claims and unapproved change orders made by the Company may involve negotiation and, in rare cases, litigation. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and revenues associated with unapproved change orders and claims are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company did not recognize any material amounts associated with claims and unapproved change orders during the periods presented.\nThe contract liability, Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts, represents the Companys obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has been paid by the customer or for which the Company\nhas billed the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue for future services reflected in this account are recognized, and the liability is reduced, as the Company subsequently satisfies the performance obligation under the contract.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are typically resolved within one year and are not considered significant financing components.\nConcentration of Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contracts receivable including retainage. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its customers and does not generally require collateral. The Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with these receivables on an ongoing basis. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses, due primarily to managements assessment of customers credit ratings. The Company principally deals with recurring customers, state and local governments and well-known local companies whose reputations are known to management. The Company performs credit checks for significant new customers and generally requires progress payments for significant projects. The Company generally has the ability to file liens against the property if payments are not made on a timely basis. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys contracts receivable including retainage, net balance at September 30, 2023 or September 30, 2022.\nProjects performed for various departments of transportation accounted for 36.2%, 36.8% and 33.7% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customers that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues during any of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are presented below:\n% of Consolidated Revenues for the Fiscal\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nAlabama Department of Transportation * 10.0% 10.8%\nFlorida Department of Transportation 10.7% * *\nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation 10.5% 11.2% 10.3%\n* Less than 10%\nInventories\nThe Companys inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of inventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to customers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including asphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled $75.5 million and $64.8 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $8.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company derives a significant portion of revenues from contracts with its customers, predominantly by performing construction services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. These projects are performed for a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. In addition, the Company generates revenues from the sale of construction materials, including HMA, aggregates, liquid asphalt and ready-mix concrete, to third-party public and private customers pursuant to contracts with those customers. The following table reflects, for the periods presented, (i) revenues generated from public infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to public customers and (ii) revenues generated from private infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to private customers.\n% of Consolidated Revenues for the Fiscal\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nPublic 63.0% 60.9% 61.3%\nPrivate 37.0% 39.1% 38.7%\nRevenues derived from construction projects are recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of the asset created or enhanced by the project to the customer. Recognition of revenues and cost of revenues for construction projects requires significant judgment by management, including, among other things, estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete a project and measuring progress toward completion. Management reviews contract estimates regularly to assess revisions of estimated costs to complete a project and for measurement of progress toward completion. No material adjustments to a contract were noted in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nManagement believes the Company maintains reasonable estimates based on prior experience; however, many factors contribute to changes in estimates of contract costs. Accordingly, estimates made with respect to uncompleted projects are subject to change as each project progresses and better estimates of contract costs become available. All contract costs are recorded as incurred, and revisions to estimated total costs are reflected as soon as the obligation to perform is determined. Provisions are recognized for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue, regardless of the stage of completion. When the Company incurs additional costs related to work performed by subcontractors, the Company may be able to utilize contractual provisions to back charge the subcontractors for those costs. A reduction to costs related to back charges is recognized when estimated recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Contract costs consist of (i) direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, and amounts payable to subcontractors and (ii) indirect costs related to contract performance, such as insurance, employee benefits, and equipment (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs).\nProgress toward completion is estimated using the input method, measured by the relationship of total cost incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost method). The Company believes this method best depicts the transfer of goods and services to the customer because it represents satisfaction of the Companys performance obligation under the contract, which occurs as the Company incurs costs. The Company measures percentage of completion based on the performance of a single performance obligation under its construction projects. Each of the Companys construction contracts represents a single performance obligation to complete a defined construction project. This is because goods and services promised for delivery to a customer are not distinct, as the customer cannot benefit from any individual portion of the services on its own. All deliverables under a contract are part of a project defined by a customer and represent a series of integrated goods and services that have the same pattern of delivery to the customer and use the same measure of progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the customers asset is created or enhanced by the Company. The Companys obligation is not satisfied until the entire project is complete.\nRevenue recognized during a reporting period is based on the cost-to-cost input method applied to the total transaction price, including adjustments for variable consideration, such as liquidated damages, penalties or bonuses, related to the timeliness or quality of project performance. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled or the most likely amount the Company expects to incur, in the case of liquidated damages or penalties. Such amounts are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company accounts for changes to the estimated transaction price using a cumulative catch-up adjustment.\nThe majority of the Companys public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, the Company is committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). The Companys private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated revenues and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract and become part of the single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. This is because goods and services promised under change orders are generally not distinct from the remaining goods and services under the existing contract, due to the significant integration of services performed in the context of the contract. Accordingly, change orders are generally accounted for as a modification of the existing contract and single performance obligation. The Company accounts for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Either the Company or its customers may initiate change orders, which may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work.\nRevenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, and liquid asphalt are recognized at a point in time, which is when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Generally, that point in time is when the customer accepts delivery at its facility or receives product in its own transport vehicles from one of the Companys HMA plants or aggregates facilities. Upon purchase, the Company generally provides an invoice or similar document detailing the goods transferred to the customer. The Company generally offers payment terms customary in the industry, which typically require payment ranging from point-of-sale to 30 days following purchase.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs used to measure fair value are classified using the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.\nLevel 3. Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs used in the determination of fair value are based on the best information available under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.\nThe Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, contracts receivable including retainage, accounts payable and accrued expenses reflected as current assets and current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying value to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has debt securities reflected as restricted investments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022. These investments are adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements.\nThe Company also has Term Loans and a Revolving Credit Facility, as defined and described in Note 11 - Debt. The carrying value of amounts outstanding under these credit facilities is reflected as long-term debt, net of current maturities and deferred debt issuance costs and current maturities of long-term debt on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Due to the variable rate or short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying value to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has derivative instruments. The fair value of commodity and interest rate swaps are based on forward and spot prices, as described in Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements.\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital requirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.\nManagement applies fair value measurement guidance to its impairment analysis for tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired in connection with a business combination, at fair value, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements for operating leases are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Mineral reserves and mine development costs, including stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine, are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves. Routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:\nCategory Estimated Useful Life\nLand and improvements Land, unlimited; improvements, 15-25 years\nMineral reserves Based on depletion\nBuildings 5 - 39 years\nPlants 3 - 20 years\nConstruction equipment 3 - 10 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 - 10 years\nLeasehold improvements The shorter of 15 years or the remaining lease term\nManagement periodically assesses the estimated useful life over which assets are depreciated, depleted or amortized. If the analysis warrants a change in the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment, management will reduce the estimated useful life and depreciate, deplete or amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life.\nThe carrying amounts of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated in the period of disposal, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the same period.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might cause management to perform impairment testing include, but are not limited to, (i) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, (iii) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset, (iv) an operating or cash flow performance combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, and (v) an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If indicators of potential impairment are present, management performs a recoverability test and, if necessary, records an impairment loss. If the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset or asset group is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, measured as the amount required to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with the best available information based on the hierarchy described under Fair Value Measurements above. For example, the Company would first seek to identify quoted prices or other observable market data. If observable data is not available, management would apply the best available information under the circumstances to a technique, such as a discounted cash flow model, to estimate fair value. Impairment analysis involves estimates and the use of assumptions in connection with judgments made in forecasting long-term estimated inflows and outflows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset, and determining the ultimate useful lives of assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions, which could materially impact the results of an impairment assessment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Other intangible assets consist of an indefinite-lived trade name license in connection with a business acquired, and finite-lived assets, including a non-compete agreement, customer relationships and construction backlog, each acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, management evaluates whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Judgments regarding indicators of potential impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.\nAnnually, on the first day of the Companys fourth fiscal quarter, management performs an analysis of the carrying value of goodwill at its reporting unit for potential impairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting units carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine whether there is any impairment. The Company may also elect to initially perform a quantitative analysis instead of starting with a qualitative assessment. Because the Company has only one reporting unit, a market capitalization calculation can be performed as the first step of the quantitative assessment by comparing the book value of the Companys stock (determined by reference to the Companys stockholders equity) to the fair value of a share of the Companys stock. If the fair value of the stock is greater than the book value of the stock, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value is less than the book value, then the Company must take a second step to determine the impairment amount, as described below.\nThe second step requires comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value, typically using the multiple period discounting method under the income approach and market approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow model, which involves significant estimates and assumptions, including preparation of revenues and profitability growth forecasts, selection of a discount rate, and selection of a terminal year multiple, to estimate fair value. The market approach could include applying a control premium to the market price of the Companys common stock or utilizing guideline public company multiples. Managements assessment of facts and circumstances at each analysis date could cause these assumptions to change. If the fair value of the respective reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down goodwill in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill using the market capitalization calculation for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and determined that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of each goodwill impairment test date, which is July 1 of the applicable year. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.\nManagement also annually assesses the carrying value of the Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived trade name licenses. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was determined that more likely than not the indefinite-lived trade name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCosts directly associated with obtaining debt financing are capitalized upon the issuance of long-term debt and amortized over the term of the related debt agreement. Unamortized amounts are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt liability. Loan issuance costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility are presented as a component of other assets. Loan issuance costs incurred in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the Credit Agreement.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented on a net basis by taxing authority and classified as non-current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of the Companys tax positions that are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and other expenses, respectively. Refer to Note 15 - Provision for Income Taxes for further information regarding the Companys federal and state income taxes.\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\nCompensation costs related to equity-classified share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on grant date fair value. Compensation cost for graded-vesting awards is recognized ratably over the respective vesting periods.\nAccrued Insurance Costs\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation, under which it is liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, the Captive has retained liability for the first $1,000,000 of each claim paid. Also since October 1, 2021, the Company has been a member of CIRCA, Limited, a group captive insurance company, that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. The Company utilizes various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims in excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on the Companys operating results and financial position.\nPrior to October 1, 2021, the amount for which the Company was liable for general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation claims ranged from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence. Management accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historical trends modified, if necessary, by recent events.\nThe Company provides employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company. Under the self-insured policies, the Company is liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. The Company purchases separate stop-loss insurance that limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $160,000.\nIn addition to the retention items noted above, the Companys insurance provider requires the Company to maintain a standby letter of credit. This letter of credit serves as a guarantee to pay the Companys insurance provider the incurred claim costs attributable to general liability, workers compensation and automobile liability claims, up to the amount stated in the standby letter of credit, in the event that these claims are not paid by the Company (see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies).\nWarranties\nFor some contracts, the Company is required to furnish a warranty that is usually one year in length. Because of the nature of these contracts, including contract owner inspections of the work both during construction and prior to acceptance, the Company has not experienced significant warranty costs for these short-term warranties and, therefore, has not established an accrual of these costs. Certain contracts carry longer warranty periods, for which the Company has accrued an estimate of warranty costs. The warranty liability is estimated based on the Companys experience with the specific type of construction work and was not significant as of September 30, 2023 or 2022.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net income per share attributable to common stockholders, but includes dilutive unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method.\nStripping Costs\nStripping costs are costs incurred for the removal of overburden or waste materials for the purpose of obtaining access to aggregate materials that will be commercially produced.\nStripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are capitalized and reported within property, plant and equipment, net in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, once the mine is no longer in the development stage. Pre-production stripping costs included in property, plant and equipment were $0.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nStripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs and are included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The production phase of a mine is deemed to begin when saleable minerals are extracted, regardless of the level of production. However, the production phase does not commence with the removal of de minimis saleable mineral material that occurs in conjunction with the removal of overburden or waste material for the purpose of obtaining access to aggregate materials. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $3.1 million, $1.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the underlying assets. The ARO is recognized at its estimated fair value in the period in which it is incurred. These obligations generally include the estimated net future costs of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating mines and related mine sites, in accordance with federal, state, local regulatory and land lease agreement requirements. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. The liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. If the ARO is settled for an amount other than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on settlement. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for accounting for reclamation obligations.\nTo determine the fair value of the AROs, the Company estimates the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation activities including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for future estimated inflation based on the estimated years to complete and discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. See Note 23 - Asset Retirement Obligations.\nRight of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nAt the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease by assessing whether the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. Leases are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842).\nThe Company measures and records an operating lease liability equal to the present value of the future lease payments. Because most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Companys incremental borrowing rate is used in determining the present value of lease payments. The amount of the operating lease right-of-use asset consists of: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of the operating lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, and (iii) any initial direct costs incurred. The present value calculation may account for an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are escalations in payments over the base lease term, which have been reflected in lease expense on a straight-line basis for operating leases over the expected lease term.\nThe Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) or leases to explore for or use minerals. Instead, for these types of leases, the Company recognizes lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company reports comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. Comprehensive income consists of two subsets: net income and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes adjustments for changes in fair value of an interest rate swap contract derivative and available-for-sale restricted investments. For additional information about comprehensive income, see Note 22 - Other Comprehensive Income.\nSegment Reporting and Reporting Units\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company operated in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Each of the Companys platform operating companies engages in essentially the same business, which consists primarily of infrastructure and road construction.\nManagement determined that the Company functions as a single operating segment, and thus reports as a single reportable segment. This determination is based on rules prescribed by GAAP applied to the manner in which management operates the Company. In particular, management assessed the discrete financial information routinely reviewed by the Companys chief operating decision maker (CODM), its Chief Executive Officer, to monitor the Companys operating performance and support decisions regarding allocation of resources to its operations. Specifically, performance is continuously monitored at the consolidated level and at the individual contract level to timely identify deviations from expected results. Resource allocations are based on the capacity of the Companys operating facilities to pursue new project opportunities, including reallocation of assets that are underutilized from time to time at a certain operating facility to another operating facility where additional resources might be required to fully meet demand. Other factors further supporting this conclusion include substantial similarities throughout all of the Companys operations with respect to services provided, type of customers, sourcing of materials and manufacturing and delivery methodologies.\nManagement further determined that, based on their economic similarities, the Companys six platform operating companies, representing components, should be aggregated into one reporting unit for purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. These legal entities represent material acquisitions that occurred over time pursuant to the Companys strategic growth strategy. Each platform company is managed by its president, who has primary responsibility for the respective operating company. Collectively, these presidents are directly accountable to, and maintain regular contact with the CODM as a team to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and operating plans for the Companys single operating segment.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (Topic 805), which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nDetermining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company engages third-party appraisal firms when appropriate to assist in the fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.\nNote 3 - Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company monitors all Accounting Standards Update (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other authoritative guidance. There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nNote 4 - Business Acquisitions\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries made the following business acquisitions:\nTennessee Acquisition\nOn November 18, 2022, the Company acquired three HMA manufacturing plants and certain related assets located in the Nashville, Tennessee metro area for $9.5 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company disposed of a quarry in North Carolina, resulting in total cash proceeds of $37.0 million and a gain on the facility exchange of $5.4 million. The transaction established the Companys first operations in Tennessee.\nNorth Carolina Acquisition\nOn December 1, 2022, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of Ferebee Corporation, an HMA production and paving company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, for $67.3 million. The transaction established the Companys second platform company in North Carolina and added three HMA plants in the greater Charlotte/Rock Hill, North Carolina metro area.\nUpstate South Carolina Acquisition (Provisional)\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Pickens Construction, Inc., an asphalt paving company headquartered in Anderson, South Carolina, for $5.0 million. The transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Companys service market in the greater Greenville, South Carolina metro area.\nAlabama Acquisition (Provisional)\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company acquired the Huntsville, Alabama operations of Southern Site Contractors, LLC., an excavation, grading and utility contractor, for $1.1 million. The transaction enhanced the Companys vertical integration of construction services in the Huntsville, Alabama metro area.\nCoastal South Carolina Acquisition\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company acquired an HMA plant, together with the related inventory and certain equipment, of C.R. Jackson, Inc., an asphalt paving company headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, for $9.1 million. The transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Companys service market in the greater Myrtle Beach, South Carolina metro area.\nCombined Acquisitions During the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nThe above-referenced acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations in accordance with Topic 805. The Company consulted with independent third parties to assist in the valuation process. Total consideration transferred for these five acquisitions was $92.0 million as of September 30, 2023.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodologies described under Fair Value Measurements in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the aggregate amount of $29.6 million for these five acquisitions, which is deductible for income tax purposes.

The Credit Agreement has been amended and restated on multiple occasions since its inception in order to provide for changes in the economic terms of the credit facility and developments at the Company. The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Companys assets.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for (i) a term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the Term Loan) the full amount of which was drawn at closing, (ii) a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million, (the Revolving Credit Facility), and (iii) a delayed draw term loan facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Delayed Draw Term Loan and together with the Term Loan, the Term Loans).\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, there was $283.8 million and $271.9 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loans, $93.1 million and $105.1 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $222.1 million and $208.6 million, respectively, under the Revolving Credit Facility, including a reduction for outstanding letters of credit.\nAll outstanding advances under the Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full on June 30, 2027 (the Maturity Date). The Term Loan (commencing on September 30, 2022) and the Delayed Draw Term Loan (commencing on\nSeptember 30, 2023) will amortize in quarterly installments in an amount (subject, in each case, to adjustments for prior mandatory and voluntary prepayments of principal) equal to: (a) 1.25% of the original principal and continuing on each of the following eleven quarter-end payment dates; (b) 1.875% of the original principal on each of the next eight quarter-end payment dates; and (c) all remaining principal of the Term Loans are due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. The annual interest rates applicable to advances will be calculated, at the Companys option, by using either a base rate, Daily Simple SOFR plus 0.10%, or Term SOFR plus 0.10%, and in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage that corresponds to the Companys consolidated net leverage ratio. Subject to various requirements, the Company generally may (and, under certain circumstances, must) prepay all or a portion of the outstanding balance of the advances, together with accrued interest thereon, prior to their contractual maturity.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Companys ability to make acquisitions, make loans or advances, make capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends, create or incur indebtedness, create liens, wind up or dissolve, consolidate, merge or liquidate, or sell, transfer or dispose of assets. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Companys fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.56-to-1.00 and 2.56-to-1.00, respectively, and the Companys consolidated leverage ratio was 1.72-to-1.00 and 2.79-to-1.00, respectively. At both September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nFrom time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate notional value of these interest rate swap agreements was $300.0 million and the fair value was $26.9 million and $24.7 million, respectively, which is included within other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe scheduled contractual repayment terms of long-term debt at September 30, 2023 are as follows:\nFiscal Year Amount\n2024 15,000\n2025 18,750\n2026 22,500\n2027 320,600\nTotal 376,850\nInterest expense was $18.7 million, $7.9 million and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization of deferred debt issuance costs included in interest expense was $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 12 - Equity\nShares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting rights, conversion rights and transfer restrictions applicable to shares of Class B common stock. The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, unless otherwise required by applicable law or the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder or upon any transfer, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be converted into shares of Class A common stock. Once converted into shares of Class A common stock, shares of Class B common stock will not be reissued. Class A common stock is not convertible into any other class of the Companys capital stock.\nConversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, certain stockholders of the Company converted a total of 2,354,404 shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As of September 30, 2023, there were 43,727,680 shares of Class A common stock and 8,998,511 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company awarded a total of 210,412 restricted shares of Class A common stock to certain members of Company management under the Construction Partners, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Incentive Plan).\nAdditional information about these transactions is set forth in Note 14 - Equity-Based Compensation.\nTreasury Stock\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company received a total of 5,267 shares of Class A common stock from employees for reimbursement of income taxes paid by the Company on behalf of these employees related to the vesting of restricted stock awards. The Company received another 24,893 shares of Class A common stock through forfeitures of restricted stock awards by terminated employees.\nNote 13 - Earnings Per Share\nAs discussed in Note 12 - Equity, the Company has Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Because the only differences between the two classes of common stock are related to voting rights, conversion rights and transfer restrictions applicable to shares of Class B common stock, the Company has not presented earnings per share under the two-class method, as the earnings per share are the same for both Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The following table summarizes the weighted-average number of basic common shares outstanding and the calculation of basic earnings per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 49,001 $ 21,376 $ 20,177\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic 51,827,001 51,773,559 51,636,955\nNet income per common share attributable to common stockholders, basic $ 0.95 $ 0.41 $ 0.39\nThe following table summarizes the calculation of the weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding and the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods presented (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 49,001 $ 21,376 $ 20,177\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of basic common\nshares outstanding, basic 51,827,001 51,773,559 51,636,955\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRestricted stock unit grants 433,205 183,861 136,258\nWeighted average number of diluted common\nshares outstanding: 52,260,206 51,957,420 51,773,213\nNet income per diluted common share attributable\nto common stockholders $ 0.94 $ 0.41 $ 0.39\nNote 14 - Equity-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, over the requisite vesting periods for all stock-based payment awards made, and recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

The final number of shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of PSUs can range from 0% to 150% of the number of PSUs initially granted, depending on the level of achievement, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The achievement of performance goals is modified by the total shareholder return ranking of the Company against the Russell 2000 Index over the performance period and can increase or decrease the achieved award by up to 15%. The Company recognizes expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for PSUs based on the forecasted achievement of Company performance metrics, multiplied by the fair value of the total number of shares of common stock that the Company anticipates will be issued based on such achievement.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company awarded PSUs representing a target of 92,423 shares and forecasted vesting of 65,024 shares of Class A common stock to certain members of Company management under the Equity Incentive Plan.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company awarded PSUs representing a target of 131,341 shares and forecasted vesting of 98,505 shares of Class A common stock to certain members of Company management under the Equity Incentive Plan.

At September 30, 2023, the Company forecasted 163,529 restricted shares of Class A common stock as unvested and approximately $2.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards.\nNote 15 - Provision for Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states. Management evaluated the Companys tax positions based on appropriate provisions of applicable enacted tax laws and regulations and believes that they are supportable based on their specific technical merits and the facts and circumstances of the transactions.\nThe provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent\nU.S. Federal $ 3,520 $ - $ 3,609\nState 1,718 949 995\nTotal current 5,238 949 4,604\nDeferred\nU.S. Federal 9,959 5,662 3,029\nState 1,206 304 716\nTotal deferred 11,165 5,966 3,745\nProvision for income taxes $ 16,403 $ 6,915 $ 8,349\nDifferences exist between income and expenses reported on the consolidated financial statements and those deducted for U.S. federal and state income tax reporting. The Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following temporary difference tax effects at September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets\nAllowance for bad debt $ 226 $ 150\nAmortization of finite-lived intangible assets 1,022 943\nFederal net operating loss carryforward - 2,632\nFederal 163J carryforward 1,254 -\nState net operating loss carryforward 1,177 1,205\nEmployee benefits 4,695 1,986\nAcquisition liabilities 796 2,127\nAccrued insurance claims 536 911\nOther 1,151 998\nTotal deferred tax assets 10,857 10,952\nDeferred tax liabilities\nAmortization of goodwill (8,647) (6,582)\nProperty, plant and equipment (32,939) (24,131)\nInterest rate swap contract (6,343) (5,692)\nOther (49) (1,260)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (47,978) (37,665)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (37,121) $ (26,713)\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022 include gross deferred tax assets of $10.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the weight of all evidence known and available as of the balance sheet date, management believes that these tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized in the future. To the extent that management does\nnot consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nIncome taxes payable have been reduced by fuel tax credits of $0.3 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The remaining amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes was $109.5 million and $92.5 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) to amounts reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nAsset: Deferred income taxes, net $ - $ -\nLiability: Deferred income taxes, net (37,121) (26,713)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (37,121) $ (26,713)\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $0.0 million and $10.5 million, respectively, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $27.8 million and $38.0 million, respectively. The state net operating loss credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2032 and 2042 or are indefinite.\nThe U.S. statutory federal income tax rate applicable to the Company was 21% during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The following table reconciles income taxes based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Companys income before provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nProvision for income tax at federal statutory rate $ 13,735 $ 5,941 $ 5,990\nState income taxes 2,222 569 1,351\nPermanent differences 348 353 961\nOther 98 52 47\nProvision for income taxes $ 16,403 $ 6,915 $ 8,349\nUncertain Tax Positions\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (Topic 740), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions in the United States. Tax audits, by their nature, are often complex. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of the calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, management determines whether the benefits of the Companys tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. The Company performed an analysis of its tax positions and determined that no uncertain tax positions existed at September 30, 2023 or 2022. Accordingly, there was no liability for uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2023 or 2022. Based on the provisions of Topic 740, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2023 or 2022. Due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the Companys federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 through 2022 are subject to examination. Various state income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 through 2022 are also subject to examination.\nNote 16 - Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company offers a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who are at least 18 years old and have more than six months of service. The Company makes discretionary employer contributions, subject to IRS safe harbor rules. Employer contributions charged to earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $6.8 million, $5.5 million, and $3.9 million, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), under which the first offering period commenced July 1, 2023. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide the Companys employees with an opportunity to purchase shares on the exercise date at a price equal to 85% of the fair value of the Companys Class A common stock as of either the exercise date, or the first day of the relevant offering period, whichever is less. Employer expense charged to earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $0.1 million, $0.0 million, and $0.0 million, respectively.\nNote 17 - Related Parties\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company sold an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary to an immediate family member of an executive officer of the Company (Purchaser of Subsidiary) in consideration for an interest-bearing note receivable in the amount of $1.0 million, which approximated the net book value of the disposed entity. At September 30, 2023, $0.1 million and $0.2 million was reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable. In connection with this transaction, the Company also received an interest-bearing note receivable from the disposed entity (Disposed Entity) on December 31, 2017 in the amount of $1.0 million representing certain accounts payable of the disposed entity that were paid by the Company. At September 30, 2023, $0.1 million and $0.1 million was reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable. Remaining principal and interest payments are scheduled to be made in periodic installments during fiscal year 2024 through fiscal year 2026.\nPrior to its acquisition by the Company, a current subsidiary of the Company advanced funds to an entity owned by an immediate family member of an officer of the Company in connection with a land development project. The obligations of the borrower entity to repay the advances were guaranteed by a separate entity owned by the same family member of the officer. Amounts outstanding under the advances did not bear interest and matured in full in March 2021. In March 2021, the subsidiary of the Company amended and restated the terms of the repayment obligation, as a result of which the officer personally assumed the remaining balance of the obligation. No new amounts were advanced to the officer by the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof in connection with the transaction. Under the amended and restated terms, the officer executed a promissory note in favor of the Companys subsidiary in the principal amount of $0.8 million. The note bears simple interest at a rate of 4.0% and requires annual minimum payments of $0.1 million inclusive of principal and accrued interest, with any remaining principal and accrued interest due and payable in full on December 31, 2027. Amounts outstanding under the note are reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets (Land Development Project).\nFrom time to time, the Company conducts or has conducted business with the following related parties:\nEntities owned by immediate family members of an executive officer of the Company perform subcontract work for a subsidiary of the Company, including trucking and grading services (Subcontracting Services).\nSince June 1, 2014, the Company has been a party to an access agreement with Island Pond Corporate Services, LLC, which provides a location for the Company to conduct business development activities from time to time on a property owned by the Executive Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors (Island Pond).\nThe Company is party to a management services agreement with SunTx, under which the Company pays SunTx $0.31 million per fiscal quarter and reimburses certain travel and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with services rendered under the management services agreement.\nThe following table presents revenues earned and expenses incurred by the Company during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and receivable and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2023 and 2022, related to transactions with the related parties described above (in thousands):\nRevenue Earned (Expense Incurred) Receivable (Payable)\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022\nPurchaser of subsidiary $ - $ - $ - $ 311 $ 414\nDisposed entity - - - 198 264\nLand Development Project - - - 632 712\nSubcontracting Services (8,627) (1) (8,655) (1) (9,385) (1) (593) (695)\nIsland Pond (340) (2) (320) (2) (320) (2) - -\nSunTx (1,486) (2) (1,451) (2) (1,935) (2) - -\n(1) Cost is reflected as cost of revenues on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n(2) Cost is reflected as general and administrative expenses on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to inquiries or audits by taxing authorities arising from its operations, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as income taxes and other types of taxes. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may not be resolved in the Companys favor. The Company is also involved in other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, and management did not accrue any material loss contingencies for the periods presented. However, adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary course inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nLetters of Credit\nUnder the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a total capacity of $325.0 million that may be used for a combination of cash borrowings and letter of credit issuances. At each of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $9.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively, primarily related to certain insurance policies as described in Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had unconditional purchase commitments for diesel fuel and natural gas in the normal course of business in the aggregate amount of $3.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Management does not expect any significant changes in the market value of these goods during the commitment period that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Companys purchase commitments annually thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Amount\n2024 $ 3,139\n2025 536\nTotal $ 3,675\nMinimum Royalties\nThe Company has lease agreements associated with aggregates facilities under which the Company makes royalty payments. These agreements are outside the scope of Topic 842. The payments are generally based on tons sold in a particular period; however, certain agreements have minimum annual payments. The Company has commitments in the form of minimum royalties as of September 30, 2023 in the amount of $2.5 million, due as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Amount\n2024 $ 295\n2025 256\n2026 192\n2027 180\n2028 145\nThereafter 1,470\nTotal $ 2,538\nRoyalty expense recorded in cost of revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nNote 19 - Leases\nThe Company leases certain facilities, office space, vehicles and equipment. As of September 30, 2023, operating leases under Topic 842 were included in (i) operating lease right-of use assets, (ii) current portion of operating lease liabilities and (iii) operating lease liabilities, net of current portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the amounts of $14.5 million, $2.3 million and $12.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any lease contracts that had not yet commenced but had created significant rights and obligations.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $ 3,150 $ 2,568 $ 2,475\nShort-term lease cost 22,631 21,177 13,346\nTotal lease expense 25,781 23,745 15,821\nShort-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) are not capitalized but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority of the Companys short-term leases relate to equipment used on construction projects. These leases are entered into at periodic rental rates for an unspecified duration and typically have a termination for convenience provision.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the weighted-average remaining term of the Companys operating leases was 8.0 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 3.36%. As of September 30, 2023, the lease liability was equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate on the Companys secured debt using a single maturity discount rate, as such rate is not materially different from the discount rate applied to each of the leases in the portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys undiscounted lease liabilities outstanding as of September 30, 2023 (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Amount\n2024 $ 2,793\n2025 2,389\n2026 2,240\n2027 2,018\n2028 1,712\nThereafter 6,117\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 17,269\nLess: imputed interest 2,282\nTotal $ 14,987\nNote 20 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 under Topic 820 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using\nSeptember 30, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCommodity swap contracts $ - $ 204 $ -\nInterest rate swaps - 26,909 -\nCorporate debt securities - 5,605 -\nU.S. government securities - 6,549 -\nMunicipal government securities - 1,748 -\nOther debt securities - 1,177 -\nTotal Assets $ - $ 42,192 $ -\nLiabilities:\nCommodity swap contracts $ - $ 20 $ -\nTotal Liabilities $ - $ 20 $ -\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using\nSeptember 30, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCommodity swap contracts $ - $ 1,187 $ -\nInterest rate swaps - 24,719 -\nCorporate debt securities - 2,537 -\nU.S. government securities - 2,481 -\nMunicipal government securities - 1,055 -\nOther debt securities - 793 -\nTotal Assets $ - $ 32,772 $ -\nLiabilities:\nCommodity swap contracts $ - $ 661 $ -\nTotal Liabilities $ - $ 661 $ -\nThe fair value of interest rate swap contracts is based on a model-driven valuation using the observable components (e.g., interest rates), which are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the contracts. The fair value of the Companys commodity swap contracts is based on an analysis of the expected cash flow of the contract in combination with observable forward price inputs obtained from a third-party pricing source. The calculations are adjusted for credit risk. Therefore, the Companys derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivative assets are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative liabilities are included within Accrued expense and other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and U.S. Government and agency obligations. The fair value of these investments is determined based on market quotes. These investments are included within Restricted Investments on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 21 - Investment in Derivative Instruments\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts\nThe Company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall strategy to manage its exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company regularly monitors the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to its derivative instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe Company records all derivatives at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as one of the following: (i) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid (cash flow hedge) or (ii) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge).\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until they are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.\nIf the Company does not specifically designate a derivative as one of the above, changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivative instrument are reported in current period earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity.\nIf the Company determines that it qualifies for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging activities, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions and linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company performs an initial prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness on a quantitative basis between the inception date and the earlier of the first quarterly hedge effectiveness date or the issuance of the financial statements that include the hedged transaction. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of designated hedges in offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations using a qualitative assessment. The Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable or the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised.\nCommodity Swap Contracts\nThe Companys operations expose it to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. As part of its risk management process, the Company began entering into commodity swap transactions through regulated commodity exchanges. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Changes in fair value of commodity swaps are recognized in earnings.\nThe following table represents the approximate amount of realized and unrealized gains (losses) and changes in fair value recognized in earnings on commodity derivative contracts for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the fair value of these derivatives as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nChange in Change in Change in\nRealized Gain (Loss) Unrealized Gain (Loss) Total Gain (Loss) Realized Gain (Loss) Unrealized Gain (Loss) Total Gain (Loss) Realized Gain (Loss) Unrealized Gain (Loss) Total Gain (Loss)\nCost of revenues $ (2,255) $ (342) $ (2,597) $ 3,472 $ (1,286) $ 2,186 $ 830 $ 2,315 $ 3,145\nInterest expense, net 8,297 - 8,297 (806) 1,668 862 (890) 894 4\nTotal $ 6,042 $ (342) $ 5,700 $ 2,666 $ 382 $ 3,048 $ (60) $ 3,209 $ 3,149\nSeptember 30,\nBalance Sheet Classification 2023 2022\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets - commodity swaps(2)\n$ 204 $ 1,032\nOther assets - commodity swaps(2)\n- 155\nOther assets - interest rate swap (1)\n26,909 24,719\nAccrued expense and other current liabilities - commodity swaps(2)\n(20) (601)\nOther long-term liabilities - commodity swaps(2)\n- (60)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) position $ 27,093 $ 25,245\n(1) Represents designated cash flow hedge of $26.9 million and $24.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(2) Represents derivatives not designated as hedges.\nNote 22 - Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of two subsets: net income and OCI. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, net of applicable taxes. The Companys interest rate swap contract hedge included in other comprehensive income for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was entered into on July 1, 2022 with an original notional value of $300.0 million. The maturity date of this swap is June 30, 2027.
