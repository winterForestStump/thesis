It has been estimated that gamers spend in excess of 7 hours per week gaming, which continues to grow, with gamers between the ages of 26 and 35 spending 8.2 hours per week gaming and gamers over 60 spending about 5.6 hours per week gaming.\nGenerally, the video game hardware platforms are divided into mobile gaming on smartphones, PC/laptop gaming and consoles. It is estimated that in 2018, mobile gaming generated approximately $63.2 billion in revenues whereas the PC/laptop market generated approximately $33.5 billion in revenues and console gaming generated approximately $38 billion in revenues. Virtual reality games (VR) is still in its relative infancy and mostly in the PC/laptop and console venues but is expected to grow substantially as hardware continues to improve, becomes more affordable and becomes more prolific among mobile gamers. In addition, VR content is still in its relative infancy, which could provide an opportunity for content providers in the coming years.\nMobile gaming has seen the largest growth over the other hardware platforms, largely driven by affordability of the devices and availability of content. The largest growing trend within the mobile gaming market has been the free-to-play model whereby monetization comes from in-game purchases. Mobile gaming has its largest footprint in Southeast Asia where mobile devices have seen substantial proliferation over the last decade, whereas console gaming has its largest footprints in North America and Europe where disposable income is higher than other regions of the world.\nCompetition\nThe video game industry is extremely competitive globally with competitors ranging from small independent developers with limited resources to very large development companies with significant financial, technical and marketing resources, such as Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., Activision Blizzard, Inc., Electronic Arts, Inc. and Ubisoft Entertainment, S.A.\nIn addition, while the industry is experiencing significant growth, it also continues to evolve and create new markets, which could lead to additional competition in the future.\nEmployees\nAt this time, we have no full-time or part time employees.

Revenue was derived from royalty interests in five games, Carmageddon Max Damage, Carmageddon Crashers, Catch & Release, Interplanetary: Enhanced Edition and Worbital. This decrease in revenue is largely due to the fact that these games have been in the marketplace for several years and decreasing revenue over time is part of the natural sales cycle for video games. Over the last year, the Company has entered into several new development agreements, that when completed should substantially increase the Companys revenue.\nOperating expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled $1,265,153 and $265,027, respectively. This represents a 377% increase over the years. Operating expenses were comprised of professional fees of $854,548 and $249,078; marketing and advertising of $335,916 and $4,000; travel, meals, and entertainment of $39,897 and $0; general and administrative of $18,253 and $11,949; and research and development of $16,539 and $0 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The significant increases during the year ended September 30, 2022 over 2021 was due to an overall increase in operations. During fiscal 2022, the Company entered into several marketing and development agreements that are intended to position the Company for a substantial increase in growth going forward.. The Company also incurred $656,093 in stock-based compensation during fiscal 2022 as compared to $0 in fiscal 2021.\nOther income (expense) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled ($535,582) and ($48,344), respectively, resulting in an increase of $487,238. Other income (expense) were comprised of other income of $1,500 and $1,754; bad debt expense of ($7,754) and $0; amortization of debt discount of ($423,061) and $0; interest expense, related party of ($56,343) and ($49,335); interest expense of ($48,928) and ($1,171); and gain (loss) from foreign currency of ($996) and 408 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a loss of $1,670,109 and $119,021, respectively. The increase of $1,551,088 was mainly associated with the decrease in revenue in 2022 offset by increases in operating expenses and amortization of debt discount in fiscal 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash of $36,378, compared to $251,064 at September 30, 2021. Working capital was $809,447 as of September 30, 2022, compared to $293,754 at September 30, 2021. The increase in working capital of $515,693 was due to an increase in prepaid expenses of $1,956,215 at September 30, 2022 and reclass of related party debt of $741,030 principal and accrued interest of $223,940 from long-term liabilities at September 30, 2021 to current liabilities at September 30, 2022.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $464,436. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $4,945. The change over the two years presented was $469,381.\nCash flows used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 included a net loss of $1,670,109, offset by stock-based compensation of $656,093, debt discount amortization of $423,061, and bad debt expense of $7,754, along with net change in operating assets and liabilities of $118,765.\nCash flows from operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 included a net loss of $119,021, offset by net change in operating assets and liabilities of $123,966.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $0 and $7,500, respectively. In 2021 the Company advanced money of $7,500 to an unrelated party.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $249,750 and $217,375, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the Company received proceeds from a note payable of $434,750 and proceeds from the sale of common stock of $50,000. This was offset by payments made to notes payable of $235,000. In fiscal 2021, the Company received proceeds from a note payable of $217,375. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nVIRTUAL INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nINDEX\nPage No.\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 6117)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nVirtual Interactive Technologies Corp.\nDenver, CO\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Virtual Interactive Technologies Corp. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Considerations\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses since inception and has not achieved profitable operations, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoing Concern - Disclosure\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. As noted in Going Concern Considerations above, the Company has a history of recurring net losses and has not achieved profitable operations. The Company has contractual obligations, such as commitments for repayment of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and notes payable (collectively obligations). Currently, managements forecasts and related assumptions illustrate their intent to meet the obligations through reinvesting royalties revenues into the development of additional video games, thereby enhancing its video game portfolio and increasing revenues; managing expenditures; obtaining debt financing from related and unrelated parties; and issuing capital stock for additional funding to meet its operating needs. Should there be constraints on the ability to increase revenues or access financing through stock issuances, the Company will continue to manage cash outflows and meet the obligations through debt financing.\nWe identified managements assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter. Management made judgments regarding its ability and intent to effectively implement its plans and provide the necessary cash flows to fund the Companys obligations as they become due. Specifically, the judgments with the highest degree of impact and subjectivity in determining the Companys ability and intent that its plans will be effectively implemented include its ability to increase revenues, manage expenditures, access funding from the capital market, and obtain debt financing. Auditing the judgments made by management required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included, among others, evaluating the Companys ability to: (i) increase revenues, (ii) access funding from the capital market, (iii) manage expenditures, and (iv) obtain debt financing.\n/s/ Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah, a DBA of Heaton & Co., PLLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nFarmington, UT\nDecember 29, 2022\nVirtual Interactive Technologies Corp.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 36,378 $ 251,064\nRoyalties receivable 83,644 115,830\nInterest receivable 4,586 3,340\nPrepaid expenses 1,956,215 -\nNote receivable 25,000 25,000\nTotal current assets 2,105,823 395,234\nConvertible note receivable -

Nature of Business\nNature of Business\nVirtual Interactive Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK: VRVR) (VIT) or (the Company) is a next generation game and metaverse developer that creates immersion experiences by harnessing the latest technologies, including Blockchain and digital assets. The Companys newly launched brand, Extrosive, is building a metaverse that replaces traditional boring financial experiences with a new paradigm, global Prosperity space (gPs). This new asset class dynamically augments global and local realities and builds communities of aligned financial values, virtuous economies, and a trusted network. The result would be a metaverse game for the glamourous world of Wall Street, High-Speed trading involving community building, quantified self, and NFTs - a pure adrenal rush! In addition, the Company continues to build on its successful catalog that includes Carmageddon Max Damage, Carmageddon Crashers, Interplanetary: Enhanced Edition, Catch & Release, and Worbitol. The Company also entered into a joint development partnership with Duane Lee Dog Chapman, of the Dog The Bounty Hunter fame, to develop and promote multiple games across several platforms. For more information, please visit www.vrvrcorp.com.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP), which contemplates the Companys continuation as a going concern. The Company has not established profitable operations and has incurred significant losses since its inception. The Companys plan is to grow significantly over the next few years through strategic game development partnerships, through internal game development and through the acquisition of independent game development companies globally.\nThe Company has taken much of the cash flow from its first royalty agreement and has invested in royalty agreements for the development of several other video games. By continuing to reinvest these royalties into agreements to develop new games, along with actively managing corporate overhead, managements plan is to substantially increase its video game royalty portfolio and cash flow over the next several years. The Company intends to continue to grow its game portfolio over the next several years, focusing on console games, virtual reality games and mobile games.\nThere are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings and/or debt financing necessary to support its working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or debt financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available to the Company, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations.\nDue to uncertainties related to these matters, there exists a substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact on our ability to obtain financing to fund the operations. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact at this time.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements herein contain the operations of VRVR and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AIG Inc and AIG Ltd (collectively, the Company) as of and for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Companys headquarters are located in Denver, Colorado and substantially all of its customers are outside the United States.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with accounting standard ASC 820-10-50, Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follows:\n- Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n- Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n- Level 3 inputs to valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.\nThe Companys financial instruments consist of cash, royalties receivable, prepaid expenses, note receivable, convertible note receivable, interest receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates fair value due to the stated face values and short-term nature of the instruments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents at September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nRoyalty Contracts and Research and Development Costs\nThe Company enters into agreements with third-party developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services. In exchange for our payments, we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game titles as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. Such agreements typically allow us to fully recover these payments, plus a profit, to the developers at an agreed-upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent sales of such software, net of any agreed-upon costs. Prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product, we record any costs incurred by third-party developers as research and development expenses. Subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product, we capitalize all development and production service payments to third-party developers as royalty contracts. The Company had no capitalizable research and development costs during the year ended September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. The Company compares the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairment loss on long-lived assets for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $0 and $0, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company follows the guidance contained in ASC 606, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 outlines the following five-step revenue recognition model (along with other guidance impacted by this standard): (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; (5) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue - Royalties\nThe Company enters into agreements with third-party developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services. In exchange for our payments, we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game titles as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. The Company has several contracts with video game developers that entitle us to royalty streams as a percentage of revenues generated by the game sales, which vary from contract to contract. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has four royalty contracts with three developers that are generating royalty revenue.\nOnce a game has been developed and has met the terms of the underlying royalty agreement, the game is released for commercial sales. Per each contract, the Company will receive reports on a regular basis from the game developers sales platforms that identify the amount of game sales, from which consideration expected to be collected from the commercial customers is computed based on the applicable royalty percentages. Royalty revenue is based on a percentage of net receipts as defined in each customer agreement and is recognized in accordance with the sale-based royalty provisions of ASC 606, which requires revenue recognition after the subsequent sales occur. The Companys performance obligation under each royalty contract as an investor in the game is complete once funds are advanced to the gaming developer. Subsequent consideration is then received by the Company from the developers in the amount of the Companys percentage fee of royalty income (net receipts) received by the customer. Net receipts include all gross revenues received by the customer as a result of sales of the games or related exploitation less certain taxes, refunds, manufacturing costs, freight, and other items specified in the underlying contract.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized revenue from royalties of $130,626 and $194,350, respectively.\nRoyalties Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible royalties. The Companys estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of royalties receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Companys estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change and that losses ultimately incurred could differ materially from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance. The Company had royalties receivable of $83,644 and $115,830 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and has determined that no allowance is necessary.\nForeign Currency\nThe Companys functional currency is the US dollar. With the exception of stockholders equity (deficit), all transactions that are originally denominated in foreign currency are translated to US dollars by our international customers, on a monthly basis, when recognized by them and prior to paying royalties to the Company. All royalty revenues that are received and recognized by the Company are recorded in US dollars.\nThe Company has a Euro currency bank account located in Bermuda. This account is used for payments to vendors that bill the Company in a currency other than US dollars and for funds received from shareholders located outside the United States. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Euro account had a balance of $0 and $0 Euros, respectively.\nForeign currency translation gains/losses are recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income (AOCI) based on exchange rates prevalent on reporting dates for balance sheet items, and at weighted average exchange rates during the reporting period for the statement of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains/losses are recorded as other income (expense) in the period of settlement. No AOCI items were present during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, as all financial statement items were denominated in the US dollar. Minimal gain (loss) from foreign currency transactions during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled $(996) and $408, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenues and expenses reported for the period presented. The most significant estimates relate to the useful life and impairment of intangible assets and allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company regularly will assess these estimates and, while actual results may differ, management believes that the estimates are reasonable.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nSome of our US dollar balances are held in a Bermuda bank that is not insured. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, uninsured deposits in the Bermuda bank totaled $20,495 and $20,649, respectively. Our management believes that the financial institution is financially sound, and the risk of loss is low. The Company is in the process of migrating its banking to the institutions in the United States, which are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company did not accrue corporate income taxes for AIG Ltd, as it is incorporated in the country of Bermuda where there is no corporate income tax. The Company has been subject to US Federal and state income taxes commencing the year ended September 30, 2020, due to its business combinations with two US companies.\nDeferred taxes for the VRVR (Nevada) and AIG Inc (Colorado) are provided on a liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company evaluates its tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Companys tax returns to determine whether the tax position will more likely than not be sustained by the applicable tax authority and has determined that there are no significant uncertain tax positions.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nIn accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share, the basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted on an if-converted basis (for convertible preferred stock). During the year ended September 30, 2022, 325,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred stock were converted into 325,000 shares of common stock. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 270,612 and 595,612 shares, respectively, of Series B Convertible Preferred stock issued and outstanding that are convertible into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. In addition, during the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued warrants to purchase 900,000 shares of common stock to two groups for contract services. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 900,000 and -0- warrants, respectively, issued and outstanding that are exercisable into shares of common stock. These potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the EPS computation due to their anti-dilutive effect resulting from the Companys net losses during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nSchedule of Anti-dilutive Securities from Computation of Common Shares\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 7,270,761 6,819,518\nIf-converted shares, Warrants 900,000 -\nIf-converted shares, Series B preferred shares 270,612 595,612\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 8,441,373 7,415,130\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for equity awards issued to employees and non-employees for services rendered in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. These transactions are accounted for based on the grant date fair value of the equity award issued. A resulting compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period.\nRecent Account Pronouncements\nThe Company has evaluated all recently issued or enacted accounting pronouncements, and has determined that all such pronouncements either do not apply or their impact is insignificant to the financial statements.\nCOVID-19 Uncertainties\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact on our ability to obtain financing to fund the operations. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact at this time.\nNote 3 - Royalty Contracts\nThe Company has valued their acquired royalty contracts with customers using the lower of cost or net realizable value method. Ultimately the market value of the contracts is equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash flow. Royalty contracts are amortized over the life of the contact (generally three-to-five years). Management assesses the value of each royalty contract asset on an annual basis and should it be apparent that the market value of the royalty contract becomes less than the carrying value, the Company would then recognize an impairment of the asset at that time. The Companys royalty contracts had been fully amortized by September 30, 2019. As such, no amortization or impairment on royalty contracts were recognized during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has three major royalty agreements (Customer A, Customer B and Customer C). Customer A represented approximately 54% and 0% of revenues and royalty receivables, respectively, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022. Customer B represented approximately 25% and 7% of revenues and royalty receivables, respectively, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022. Customer C represented approximately 21% and 93% of revenues and royalty receivables, respectively, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nCustomer A represented approximately 51% and 11% of revenues and royalty receivables, respectively, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021. Customer B represented approximately 31% and 13% of revenues and royalty receivables, respectively, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021. Customer C represented approximately 18% and 76% of revenues and royalty receivables, respectively, as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNote 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our companys reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nBased upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many smaller reporting companies with limited resources to employ a large staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.\nWe plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending for the year ended September 30, 2022: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
