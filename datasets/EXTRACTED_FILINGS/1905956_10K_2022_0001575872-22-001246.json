Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our financial statements and the financial information included in this Report reflect our organizational transactions and have been prepared as if our current corporate structure had been in place throughout the relevant periods.\nOverview\nTreasure Global Inc. (TGI, we, our, or the Company) is a holding company incorporated on March 20, 2020, under the laws of the State of Delaware. TGI has no substantive operations other than holding all of the outstanding shares of Gem Reward Sdn. Bhd. (GEM), which was established under the laws of the Malaysia on June 6, 2017, through a reverse recapitalization.\nPrior to March 11, 2021, TGI and GEM were separate companies under the common control of\nKok Pin Darren Tan, which resulted from Mr. Tans prior 100% ownership of TGI and his prior 100% voting and investment control over GEM pursuant to the Beneficial Shareholding Agreements. For a more detailed description of the Beneficial Shareholding Agreements and Mr. Tans common control over TGI and GEM see Prospectus Summary-Corporate Structure.\nOn March 11, 2021, TGI and GEM were reorganized into a parent subsidiary structure pursuant to the Share Swap Agreement in which TGI exchanged the Swap Shares for all equity of GEM. Pursuant to the Share Swap Agreement, the purchase and sale of the Swap Shares was completed on March 11, 2021, but the issuance of the Swap Shares did not occur until October 27, 2021 when TGI amended its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of its authorized common stock to a number that was sufficient to issue the Swap Shares. As a result of the Share Swap Agreement, (i) GEM became the 100% subsidiary of TGI and Kok Pin Darren Tan no longer had any control over the GEM ordinary shares and (ii) Kok Pin Darren Tan, the Initial GEM Shareholders and Chong Chan Sam Teo owned 100% of the shares of TGI common stock (Kok Pin Darren Tan owning approximately 97%). Subsequent to the date of the Share Swap Agreement, Kok Pin Darren Tan transferred 9,529,002 of his 10,000,000 shares of TGI common stock to 16 individuals and entities and currently owns less than 5% of our common stock.\nOn August 15, 2022, we had closed our initial underwritten public offering of 2,300,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, at $4.00 per share. Meanwhile we received net proceeds of approximately $8.2 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and fees, and other estimated offering expenses amounted to approximately $1.0 million.\nWe have created an innovative O2O e-commerce platform business model offering consumers and merchants instant rebates and affiliate cashback programs, while providing a seamless e-payment solution with rebates in both e-commerce (i.e., online) and physical retailers/merchant (i.e., offline) settings.\nOur proprietary product is an App branded ZCITY App, which was developed through GEM. The ZCITY App was successfully launched in Malaysia June 2020. GEM is equipped with the know-how and expertise to develop additional/add-on technology-based products and services to complement the ZCITY App, thereby growing its reach and user base.\nThrough simplifying a users e-payment gateway experience, as well as by providing great deals, rewards and promotions with every use, we aim to make the ZCITY App Malaysias top reward and loyalty platform. Our longer-term goal is for the ZCITY App and its ever-developing technology to become one of the most well-known commercialized applications more broadly in Southeast Asia and Japan.\nAs of December 5, 2022, we had over 2,312,114registered users and over 1,998 registered merchants.\nSEA consumers have access to a plethora of smart ordering, delivery and loyalty websites and apps, but in our experience, SEA consumers very rarely receive personalized deals based on their purchases and behavior.\nThe ZCITY App targets consumer through the provision of personalized deals based on consumers purchase history, location and preferences. Our technology platform allows us to identify the spending trends of our customers (the when, where, why, and how much). We are able to offer these personalized deals through the application of our proprietary artificial intelligence (or AI) technology that scours the available database to identify and create opportunities to extrapolate the greatest value from the data, analyze consumer behavior and roll out attractive rewards-based campaigns for targeted audiences. We believe this AI technology is currently a unique market differentiator for the ZCITY App.\nWe operate our ZCITY App on the hashtag: #RewardsOnRewards. We believe this branding demonstrates to users the ability to spend ZCITY App-based Reward Points (or RP) and ZCITY Cash Vouchers with discount benefits at checkout. Additionally, users can earn rewards from selected e-Wallet or other payment methods.\nZCITY App users do not require any on-going credit top-up or need to provide bank card number with their binding obligations. We have partnered with Malaysias leading payment gateway, IPAY88, for secure and convenient transactions. Users can use our secure platform and enjoy cashless shopping experiences with rebates when they shop with e-commerce and retail merchants through trusted and leading e-wallet providers such as Touchn Go eWallet, Boost eWallet, GrabPay eWallet and credit card/online banking like the FPX (the Malaysian Financial Process Exchange) as well as more traditional providers such as Visa and Mastercard.\nKey Factors that Affect Operating Results\nWe believe the key factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations include the following:\nOur Ability to Create Value for Our Users and Generate Revenue\nOur ability to create value for our users and generate our revenues from merchants is driven by the factors described below:\n\u00b7\nNumber and volume of transactions completed by our consumers\n. Consumers are attracted to ZCITY by the breadth of personalized deals/rewards and the interactive user experience our platform offers. The number and volume of transaction completed by our member consumers is affected by our ability to continue to enhance and expand our product and service offerings and improve the user experience.\n\u00b7\nEmpowering data and technology.\nOur ability to engage our member consumers and empower our merchants and their brands is affected by the breadth and depth of our data insights, such as the accuracy of our members shopping preferences, and our technology capabilities and infrastructure, and our continued ability to develop scalable services and upgrade our platform user experience to adapt to the quickly evolving industry trends and consumer preferences.\nOur Investment in User Base, Technology, People and Infrastructure\nWe have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platform to attract consumers and merchants, enhance user experience and expand the capabilities and scope of our platform. We expect to continue to invest in our research and development team as well as in our technology capabilities and infrastructure, which will lower our margins but deliver overall long-term growth.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in the loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel, and widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including:\n\u00b7\nnew information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease in Southeast Asia (or SEA);\n\u00b7\nthe duration and spread of the outbreak;\n\u00b7\nthe severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary business closures;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions are taken in response to the pandemic, including MCOs, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant pricing, and our product offerings;\n\u00b7\nother business disruptions that affect our workforce;\n\u00b7\nthe impact on capital and financial markets; and\n\u00b7\naction taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact.\nIn addition, the current outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and similar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and could in the future impact, demand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, all our merchant clients have been affected by COVID-19 measures for Food and Beverage (F&B) as these measures temporarily stopped restaurant dine-ins.\n\u00b7\nSome of our restaurant clients ceased operations permanently and many were closed since June 2020 without any notice of reopening their business to date.\n\u00b7\nWe may face continuing challenges to onboard new merchant clients.\nWith the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we also face challenges in our operation as follows:\n\u00b7\ndisruptions of operations in SEA where staff have had to work from home;\n\u00b7\non ground Marketing Strategic for new users onboard, is even more difficult; and\n\u00b7\nmarketing events being delayed.\nThe pandemic, however, has also created more advantages for us as follows:\n\u00b7\nusage of e-wallet technology has widened and become more common to the general public, people prefer to go cashless and utilize the Scan and Pay features ZCITY offers;\n\u00b7\nour teams have transitioned from on-ground marketing strategies to digital marketing strategies in order to maintain and boost user recruitment;\n\u00b7\nduring the pandemic lockdown phases, our business operations have carried on without significant disruption even as most all of our employees work remotely; and\n\u00b7\nwe have taken advantage of the push to digitalization posture taken by the Malaysian government, by providing a platform and channel to meet users daily essential payment needs such as processing bill payments, online shopping vouchers, gaming pin and e-wallet top-up vouchers.\nIn this regard, ZCITY has acted as an aggregator payment gateway, but not a digital wallet itself. We believe the business model has further enhanced user experience and reliance and developed user loyalty to our platform. We have experienced a slow-down in hiring new personnel. We believe this is due to a downturn in the available human capital in the employment market generally in Malaysia. However, with the existing talents in the organization, everyone is playing their role to fulfil the business needs while waiting for the vacancies to be filled. We have a detailed plan to attract suitable talents to join us.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations in certain cases, and cancellation of physical participation in certain meetings, events and conferences and further actions may be taken as required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and other business partners. The pandemic period is challenging, yet ZCITY is able to generate more sales revenue through virtual meetings and training to our business partners and potential markets. We are monitoring the global outbreak of the pandemic in SEA.\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the COVID-19 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nInflation\nAlthough Malaysia is experiencing a high inflation rate, we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business as of June 30, 2022, but we will continue to monitor the effects of inflation on our business in future periods.\nSupply Chain Disruptions\nAlthough there have been global supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or Russias recent invasion of Ukraine that may have affected the operations of some of our online or offline merchants, these disruptions have not had a material adverse effect on our business as of June 30, 2022, but we will continue to monitor the effects of supply chain disruptions on our business in future periods.,\nKey Operating Metrics\nOur management regularly reviews a number of metrics to evaluate our business, measures our performance, identifies trends, formulates financial projections and makes strategic decisions. The main metrics we consider, and our results for each quarter during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, are set forth in the table below:\nFor the quarters ended\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nJune 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nJune 30,\nNumber of new registered user(1)\n44,532\n281,470\n262,784\n245,582\n288,540\n364,218\n466,534\nNumber of active users(2)\n42,225\n300,270\n347,596\n362,805\n421,287\n448,247\n443,430\nNumber of new participating merchants\n(1) Registered are persons who have registered on the ZCITY App.\n(2) Active users are users who have logged into the ZCITY App at least once.\nAs of\nAs of\nAs of\nAs of\nAs of\nAs of\nAs of\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nJune 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nJune 30,\nAccumulated registered users\n58,868\n340,338\n603,122\n848,704\n1,137,244\n1,501,462\n1,967,996\nAccumulated Participating merchants\n1,635\n1,905\n1,949\n1,964\n1,978\n1,985\nWe have experienced substantial growth in registered users and active users since we launched ZCITY platform in June 2020. As of June 30, 2022, we recorded 1,967,996 registered users and 443,430 active users from ZCITY platform. Our average percentage of growth of register and active users throughout the quarter ended June 30, 2022 since the establishment of the ZCITY platform was approximately 143.4% and 283.8%, respectively. However, the average percentage of growth of registered and active users decreased in the last five quarters from June 30, 2022 which was a result of the resurgence of the COVID-19 outbreak and the imposition by the Malaysian Government of a Movement Control Order (MCO)\nin May and June of 2021 as the majority of our participating merchants are restaurant owners or service providers and required the spending from our participating members to be in person. Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 resurgence, we expect our product and loyalty program revenue to continue to grow in 2022 and beyond as a growing proportion of the Malaysian population have been fully vaccinated\nand we expect to continue to attract more people to engage with our platform.\nWe continuously monitor the development and participation of active users as a proportion of its total registered user base to ensure the effectiveness of our marketing and feature implantation strategies.

The increase was mainly attributable to the exponential growth of the registered user from our O2O e-commerce platform known as ZCITY platforms as we had acquired 1,364,874 new registered users for year ended June 30, 2022 compared to 603,122 new registered users for the same period in 2021. The increase of registered users enhanced the traffic of our platform and allowed us to monetize our revenue streams including product revenue, loyalty program revenue, transaction revenue and member subscription revenue. The change for each revenue stream was as follows:\nProduct and loyalty program revenue\nProduct revenue was generated through sales of our e-voucher, health care products, and other products through our ZCITY platform while loyalty program revenue was recognized when our customers redeem their previously earned reward points from our loyalty program or upon expiration of the reward point. We have experienced significant growth in register users and active users since we launched our ZCITY platform in June 2020. As of June 30, 2022, we recorded 1,967,996 registered users and 443,430 active users from ZCITY platform. Our average percentage of growth of registered and active users throughout the quarter ended June 30, 2022 since the establishment of ZCITY platform was approximately 143.4% and 283.8%, respectively. However, the average percentage of growth of register and active user was decreased in last five quarters as of June 30, 2022 which was resulted from the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreak and MCO\nin May and June of 2021 as majority of our participated merchants are restaurant owners or service providers and required the spending from our participated members to be in person. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19 resurgence, we expect our product and loyalty program revenue continued to grow for 2022 and beyond as more population in the Malaysia have been fully vaccinated\nand we will continue to attract more people to engage with our platform.\nTransaction revenue\nThe transactions revenue primarily consists of fees charged to merchants for participating in our ZCITY platform upon successful sales transaction and payment service taken place between the merchants and their customers online. Our transaction revenue increased by approximately $23,000 or 75.6% to approximately $54,000 for the year ended June 30, 2022 from approximately $31,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was mainly attributable to the fact that we engaged with 1,985 local merchants to connect them with their customers through our ZCITY platform as of June 30, 2022 compared to 1,905 as of June 30, 2021. Our average percentage of growth of new merchants was approximately 36.0% throughout the quarters as of June 30, 2022 since the establishment of ZCITY platform. Even though we experienced slowdown in adding new merchants to our platform during the last five quarters ended June 30, 2022, as a result of resurgence of COVID-19.\nAgent subscription revenue\nAgent subscription revenue primarily consists of fees charged to the agents in exchange for rights by introducing merchants to join our merchant network and to earn a future fixed percentage of commission fees upon completion of each sales transaction between the referred merchants and their customers. Agent subscription revenue decreased by $100,406 or 99.9% to $15 for the year ended June 30, 2022 from $100,421 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to our shift of business strategies to Zmember subscription revenue which is a member oriented program designated to attract more customer to engage with our ZCITY platform.\nMember subscription revenue\nMember subscription revenue primarily consists of fees charged to customers who signed up for Zmember, a membership program that includes exclusive saving, bonus, and referral rewards.\nMember subscription revenue increased by 100.0% to $211,441 for the year ended June 30, 2022 as we launch the Zmember program for the year end June 30, 2022 to enhance our customer engagement with our ZCITY platform. As of June 30, 2022 we had 9,370 customers who subscribed to our Zmember program.\nCost of Revenue\nOur breakdown of cost of revenues by categories for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is summarized below:\nFor the Years Ended\nJune 30,\nChange\n%\nProduct and loyalty program revenue\n$\n79,198,691\n$\n13,880,408\n470.6\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n79,198,691\n$\n13,880,408\n470.6\n%\nCost of revenues mainly consist of the purchases of the gift card or E-voucher pin code, and health care product which is directly attributable to our product revenue. Total cost of revenue increased by approximately $65.3 million or 470.6% for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared with the same period in 2021. The increase was in line with our increase revenue.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit from our major revenue categories is summarized as follows:\nFor the year\nEnded\nJune 30, 2022\nFor the year\nEnded\nJune 30, 2021\nChange\nPercentage\nChange\nProduct and loyalty program revenue\nGross profit\n$\n211,065\n$\n8,962\n$\n202,103\n2,255.1\n%\nGross margin\n0.3\n%\n0.1\n%\n0.2\n%\nTransaction revenue\nGross profit\n$\n53,667\n$\n30,562\n$\n23,105\n75.6\n%\nGross margin\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n-\n%\nAgent subscription revenue\nGross profit\n$\n$\n100,421\n$\n(100,406\n)\n(99.9\n)%\nGross margin\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\n-\n%\nMember subscription revenue\nGross profit\n$\n211,441\n$\n-\n$\n211,441\n100.0\n%\nGross margin\n100.0\n%\n-\n%\n(100.0\n)%\nTotal\nGross profit\n$\n476,188\n$\n139,945\n$\n336,243\n240.3\n%\nGross margin\n0.6\n%\n1.0\n%\n(0.4\n)%\nGross profit for the year ended June 30, 2022 amounted to approximately $0.5 million as compared to approximately $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. Gross margin was approximately 0.6% and 1.0% for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in gross profit was mainly due to increase of revenue in product and loyalty revenue and transaction revenue as result of exponential growth of registered users and active users for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to the increase of product and loyalty program revenue which brought up the denominator of our gross profit and resulted in lower overall gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2022. In the year ended June 30, 2021, our agent subscription revenue had 100% gross margin and with lower denominator of our gross profit and resulted in higher overall gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2021. Our product and loyalty program gross margin increased from 0.1% for the year ended June 30, 2021 to 0.3% for the year ended June 30, 2022. As we had more member signed up our platform, we had slightly reducing our discount to attract users to sign up with our platform and resulted in higher product and loyalty program gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and stock-based compensation.\nSelling expenses\nSelling expenses amounted to approximately $6.3 million and $3.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Representing an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 107.1%. The increase was mainly due to increase in marketing and promotion expense of approximately $3.4 million related to promoting our ZCITY platform and eventually attracting more people to sign up as members. Marketing and promotion expense also consists of redemptions of reward points which is generated from non-spending related activities (registration as a new user, referral of a new user and Spin & Win eligibility to receive reward points) in exchange for discounted credit of purchasing our products upon conversion of using the reward points. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred approximately $2.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in marketing and promotion expense, and recognized the same amount of product revenue at the time of redemption of the non-spending related activities reward points by our customers.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses amounted to approximately $2.8 million and $4.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Representing a decrease of approximately $1.5 million or 34.9%. The decrease was mainly due to decrease of approximately $2.4 million in professional/ consulting fees (including related parties) as we incurred less consulting fees related to early preparation of our initial public offering in the United States for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The decrease was offset by an increase of approximately $0.6 million in salaries expenses as a result of expansion of our business operation after the launch of our ZCITY platform.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expense amounted to approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $0.1 million or 38.8%. The decrease was mainly due to our ZCITY platform becoming more sophisticated as less maintenance was required for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nStock-Based Compensation expenses\nStock-based compensation expenses amounted to approximately $1.3 million and $0 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing increase of approximately $1.3 million. The increase was mainly due to we engaged with Exchange Listing, LLC, to provide advisory service in capital market advisory, corporate governance, and organizational meeting related to our initial public offering in the United States.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net amounted to approximately $1.5 million and $0.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Representing an increase of approximately $1.2 million or 374.3%. The increase was mainly attributable to the interest expense incurred as well as amortization of debt discount from convertible notes. For the year ended June 30, 2022, we incurred interest expense of approximately $0.3 million and amortization of debt discount of approximately $1.3 million. For the year ended June 30, 2021, we incurred interest expense of approximately $0.2 million and amortization of debt discount of approximately $0.2 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income tax were amount to $15,600 and $2,000 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The amount was attributable to tax imposed on Treasure Global Inc from the State of Delaware, as we are required to remit franchise tax to the State of Delaware on an annual basis.\nWe also were subject to controlled foreign corporations Subpart F income (Subpart F) tax, which is a tax primarily on passive income from controlled foreign corporations with a tax rate of 35%. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposed a global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax, which is a tax on certain off-shore earnings at an effective rate of 10.5% for tax years (50% deduction of the current enacted tax rate of 21%) with a partial offset for 80% foreign tax credits. If the foreign tax rate is 13.125% or higher, there will be no U.S. corporate tax after the 80% foreign tax credits are applied.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, our foreign subsidiary did not generate any income that are subject to Subpart F tax and GILTI tax.\nNet Loss\nOur net loss increased by approximately $3.8 million from approximately $8.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 to approximately $11.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, predominately due to reasons as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn assessing liquidity, we monitor and analyze cash on-hand and operating expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet working capital requirements and operating expense obligations. To date, we financed our operations primarily through cash flows from contribution from shareholders, issuance of convertible notes, related party loans, and our completion of initial underwritten public offering.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $1.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalent which primarily consists of bank deposits, which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use. We have a working capital deficit of approximately $15.9 million and $1.6 million at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2022, we have additionally borrowed approximately $2.7 million under Tophill Loan Agreement 2 on terms identical to the Tophill Loan Agreement 1 which all principal and accrued and unpaid interest outstanding will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price that is equal to 80% of the initial public offering price.\nOn August 15, 2022, we had closed our initial underwritten public offering of 2,300,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, at $4.00 per share. We had received aggregate net proceeds from the closing of approximately $8.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and fees, and other estimated offering expenses which amounted to approximately $1.0 million.\nAfter the completion of the underwritten initial public offering, following the conversion of convertible notes payable, net of unamortized discounts to equity, we expect our working capital to change from a deficit of approximately $15.9 million to a positive working capital of approximately $5.6 million.\nDespite of receiving the net proceeds from our initial underwritten public offering,\nthe management is of the opinion that we will not have sufficient funds to meet the working capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due starting from one year from the date of this report due to our recurring loss. Therefore, the\nmanagement has determined there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to generate significant revenue, we may be required to curtail or cease its operations. Management is trying to alleviate the going concern risk through the following sources:\n\u25cf\nEquity financing to support its working capital;\n\u25cf\nOther available sources of financing (including debt) from Malaysian banks and other financial institutions; and\n\u25cf\nFinancial support and credit guarantee commitments from the Companys related parties.\nThe following summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the Years Ended\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(8,663,901\n)\n$\n(6,797,648\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(311,739\n)\n(84,850\n)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n8,163,893\n9,796,905\nEffect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents\n(186,419\n)\n(71,381\n)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(998,166\n)\n$\n2,843,026\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 was approximately $8.7 million and were mainly comprised of the net loss of approximately $11.7 million, decrease of account payable (including related parties) of approximately $0.2 million as we had pay out some of the account payable balance to the third parties or related parties vendors timely, decrease of customer deposits, related parties of approximately $0.2 million as we had returned the deposit related to I.T professional service back to the related parties due to projects abandoned, and decrease of other payables, related parties as we paid out the remaining balance of professional fee incurred from two related parties of approximately $0.1 million. The net cash used in operating activities was mainly offset by amortization of debt discount of approximately $1.3 million, stock-based compensation of approximately $1.3 million, decrease of inventories of approximately $0.2 million as we improved our inventories turnover rate due to demand of our product, and the increase in other payables and accrued liability of approximately $0.7 million mainly related to the accrued professional expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was approximately $6.8 million and were mainly comprised of the net loss of approximately $7.9 million, increase of inventories of approximately $0.4 million as we need to stock up the gift card or E-voucher after the launch of our ZCITY platform for resale and the increase in prepayments of approximately $0.2 million as our vendors required us to make more deposits to secure our E-voucher purchases. The net cash used in operating activities was mainly offset by the amortization of debt discount of approximately $0.2 million, the decrease in other receivable and other current assets of approximately $0.5 million as we collected back our security deposits during the period, the increase in accounts payable (including related parties) of approximately $0.2 million as we make more purchase on account, the increase in customer deposits (including related parties) of approximately $0.3 million as we collected customer deposit from third parties and related parties related to our I.T professional service, and the increase in other payables and accrued liabilities (including related party)\nof approximately $0.5 million mainly related to the accrued professional expenses\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 was approximately $0.3 million, which was in respect of purchase of equipment for our operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was approximately $85,000, which was in respect of purchase of equipment for our operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 was approximately $8.2 million, which were mainly comprised of proceeds received from the issuance of convertible note from third parties and related parties of approximately $8.6 million, and proceeds received from third parties loans of approximately $1.5 million, offset by repayment to related parties loan of approximately $1.8 million, and approximately $0.1 million payment of deferred offering costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021 was approximately $9.8 million, which were mainly comprised of capital contributions received from the shareholders of approximately $0.2 million, proceeds received from the issuance of convertible note from third parties and related parties and senior note of approximately $5.5 million and proceeds borrowed from our related parties of approximately $4.0 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2022, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Estimate\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have identified certain accounting estimates that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from managements current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting estimates involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements include the estimated retail price per point and estimated breakage to calculate the revenue recognized in our loyalty program revenue, the useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, realization of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position, and fair value of our stock price to determine the\nbeneficial conversion feature (\"BCF\") within the convertible note\n. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any uncollectible accounts and do not bear interest, which are due after 30 days. Accounts receivable include money due from agent subscription revenue and sales of health care product on its Z-city platform. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical collection trends and aging of receivables. Management also periodically evaluates individual customers financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions to make adjustments in the allowance when it is considered necessary. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Our management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary.\nOur allowance for accounts receivables were $227 and $25,690, as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include gift card or E-voucher pin code which are purchased from our suppliers as merchandized goods or store credit, and healthcare products. Management compares the cost of inventories with the net realizable value and if applicable, an allowance is made for writing down the inventory to its net realizable value, if lower than cost. On an ongoing basis, inventories are reviewed for potential write-down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories which equals the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions. When inventories are written-down to the lower of cost or net realizable value, it is not marked up subsequently based on changes in underlying facts and circumstances. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, impairments of inventories amounted to $8,805 and $0, respectively, were provided for E-vouchers.\nOther receivables and other current assets, net\nOther receivables and other current assets primarily include refundable advance to third party service provider and other deposits. Management regularly reviews the aging of receivables and changes in payment trends and records allowances when management believes collection of amounts due are at risk. Accounts considered uncollectable are written off against allowances after exhaustive efforts at collection are made. No allowance of other receivable and other current assets were recorded as of June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nPrepayments\nPrepayments and deposits are mainly cash deposited or advanced to suppliers for future inventory purchases. This amount is refundable and bears no interest. For any prepayments determined by management that such advances will not be in receipts of inventories, services, or refundable, we will recognize an allowance account to reserve such balances. Management reviews its prepayments on a regular basis to determine if the allowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off against allowance for doubtful accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. Our management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary. No allowance of prepayments were recorded as of June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nImpairment for long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We assessed the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment is identified, we would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. No impairment for long-lived assets were recorded as of June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nRevenue recognition\nLoyalty program\n- Performance obligations satisfied over time\nOur Z-City reward loyalty program allows members to earn points on purchases that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts on future purchases. When members purchase our product or make purchase with our participated vendor through Z-City, we allocate the transaction price between the product or service, and the reward points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the reward points is initially recorded as contract liability and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration.\nThe two primary estimates utilized to record the contract liability for reward points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated breakage. The estimated retail price per point is based on the actual historical retail prices of product purchased or service obtained through the redemption of reward points. We estimate breakage of reward points based on historical redemption rates. We continually evaluate its methodology and assumptions based on developments in retail price per point redeemed, redemption patterns and other factors. Changes in the retail price per point and redemption rates have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the contract liability through current period revenue by an amount estimated to represent the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.\nConvertible notes\nWe evaluate our convertible notes to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each reporting period and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statements of operations as other income or expense.\nIn circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.\nIf the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provide for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature (BCF). A BCF is recorded by us as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF, and we amortize the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 711)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders (Deficiency) Equity for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n-\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Treasure Global Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Treasure Global Inc.\n(the Company) as of\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stock\nholders\n(deficiency) equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nCorrection of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nAs discussed in note 2, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2021 and for the year ended June 30, 2021\nhave been revised to correct the errors.\nExplanatory Paragraph - Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations, a working capital deficit and accumulated deficit at June 30, 2022\n. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note\n3. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. If the Company is unable to successfully obtain the necessary additional financial support as specified in Note 3, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express\nan\nopinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements\nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly\n, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Friedman LLP\nWe have served as\nthe Companys auditor since 202\nNew York, New York\nDecember 5, 2022\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Nature of business and organization\nTreasure Global Inc. (TGI or the Company) is a holding company incorporated on March 20, 2020, under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has no substantive operations other than holding all of the outstanding shares of Gem Reward Sdn. Bhd. (GEM), which was established under the laws of the Malaysia on June 6, 2017, through a reverse recapitalization.\nOn March 11, 2021, TGI completed a reverse recapitalization (Reorganization) under common control of its then existing shareholders, who collectively owned all of the equity interests of GEM prior to the Reorganization through a Share Swap Agreement. GEM is under common control of the same shareholders of TGI through a beneficial ownership agreement, which results in the consolidation of GEM and has been accounted for as a Reorganization of entities under common control at carrying value. Before and after the Reorganization, the Company, together with its sole subsidiary is effectively controlled by the same shareholders, and therefore the Reorganization is considered as a recapitalization of entities under common control in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805-50-25. The consolidation of the Company and its sole subsidiary have been accounted for at historical cost and prepared on the basis as if the aforementioned transactions had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5.\nThe Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, GEM, engages in the payment processing industry and operate an online-to-offline (O2O) e-commerce platform known as ZCITY. The Company has extensive business interests in creating an innovative O2O e-commerce platform with an instant rebate and affiliate cashback program business model, focusing on providing a seamless payment solution and capitalizing on big data using artificial intelligence technology. The Companys proprietary product is an internet application (or app) called ZCITY App. ZCITY App drives user app download and transactions by providing\ninstant rebate and cashback. The Company aims to transform and simplify a users e-payment gateway experience by providing great deals, rewards and promotions with every use in an effort to make it Malaysias top reward and payment gateway platform.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of TGI and its wholly owned subsidiary, GEM.\nNote 2 - Revision of previously issued financial statements\nMisclassification of convertible notes payable, related parties\nIn May and June 2021, the Company issued\nvarious tranches of convertible notes payable (CNP) to 5 accredited investors which included 4\nthird parties and 1\nrelated parties as of June 30, 2021.\nThe purpose of the CNP offering was to raise funding for the Company to support its working capital and growth requirements prior to receipt of the initial public offering (IPO) proceeds. While the relationship between certain CNP holders and the Company was disclosed within the relevant Form S-1 filings, the Company unintentionally\nmisclassified\nthe related party\nbalances from the balances with third parties and the related\ndisclosure from the consolidated financial statements and associated notes for the year ended June 30, 2021, which also formed an integral part of the Companys Form S-1 filings. As a result, the Company unintentionally misclassified related parties CNPs together with third parties CNPs under non-current liabilities and the related disclosure as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nMisclassification of other payable and accrued liability, related parties\nAs of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, due to the fact that the Company was a private company who did not possess adequate experience or qualification to establish an internal control function\nto properly identify its completed related party list. As a result, the Company unintentionally misclassified other payable and accrued liability, related parties together with third party other payables and accrued liabilities, and third party account payable under current liabilities and the related disclosure as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the balance outstanding from other payable and accrued liability, related parties was\nrelated to the consulting fee incurred from two related parties during the year ended June 30, 2021. Furthermore, the Company also identified additional related parties transactions in regards to consulting fees for the year ended June 30, 2021, and provided proper disclosure on Note 11.\nThe following tables summarize the effect of the revision on each financial statement line item as of the dates, and for the period, indicated:\nAs\nPreviously\nReported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nConsolidate balance sheet as of June 30, 2021\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccount payable\n$\n73,389\n$\n(28,402\n)\n$\n44,987\nOther payables and accrued liabilities\n543,599\n(85,000\n)\n458,599\nOther\npayables, related parties\n-\n113,402\n113,402\n$\n616,988\n$\n-\n$\n616,988\nNon-current liabilities:\nConvertible notes payable, net of unamortized discounts\n$\n4,975,453\n$\n(1,400,000\n)\n$\n3,575,453\nConvertible notes payable, related party\n-\n1,400,000\n1,400,000\n$\n4,975,453\n$\n-\n$\n4,975,453\nAs\nPreviously\nReported\nAdjustments\nAs Revised\nConsolidated statement of cash flow for the year ended June 30, 2021\nCash flows from operating activities:\nAccount payable\n$\n44,411\n$\n(28,289\n)\n$\n16,122\nOther payables and accrued liabilities\n464,076\n(85,000\n)\n379,076\nOther payables, related parties\n-\n113,289\n113,289\n$\n508,487\n$\n-\n$\n508,487\nCash flows from financing activities:\nProceeds from issuance of convertible notes\n$\n5,521,601\n$\n(1,400,000\n)\n$\n4,120,601\nProceeds from issuance of convertible notes, related parties\n-\n1,400,000\n1,400,000\n$\n5,521,601\n$\n-\n$\n5,521,601\nNote 3\n- Summary of significant accounting policies\nGoing concern\nIn assessing the Companys liquidity and substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, the Company monitors and analyzes cash on-hand and operating expenditure commitments. The Companys liquidity needs are to meet working capital requirements and operating expense obligations. To date, the Company financed its operations primarily through cash flows from contribution from shareholders, issuance of convertible note and related parties loans and its initial underwritten public offering.\nThe Companys management has considered whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to (1) loss from operations of approximately $10.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, (2) accumulated deficit of approximately $19.7 million as of June 30, 2022; (3) the working capital deficit of approximately $15.9 million as of June 30, 2022; and (4) net operating cash outflow of approximately $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2022, t\nhe Company has drawn additional approximately $2.7\nmillion from Tophill Loan Agreement 2 (as defined in Note 16\n) on terms identical to the Tophill Loan Agreement 1 (as defined in Note 9\n) which all principal and accrued and unpaid interest outstanding will automatically be converted into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price that is equal to 80% of the initial underwritten public offering price. On August 15, 2022, 2,756,879 shares of the Companys common stock were\nconverted from the principal and the accumulated interest balance of the Tophill Loan Agreement 1 and Agreement 2.\nOn August 15, 2022, the Company closed its initial underwritten public offering of 2,300,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, at $4.00 per share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds from the closing of approximately $8.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and fees, and other estimated offering expenses.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAfter the completion of the initial underwritten public offering, as well as conversion of convertible note payable, net of unamortized discount amounted to approximately $13.4 million as of June 30, 2022, the Company expects its working capital to change from a deficit of approximately $15.9 million to a positive working capital of approximately $5.6 million.\nDespite of receiving the net proceeds from its initial underwritten public offering,\nthe Companys management is of the opinion that it will not have sufficient funds to meet the Companys working capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due starting from one year from the date of this report due to the recurring loss. Therefore, the\nmanagement has determined there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to generate significant revenue, the Company may be required to curtail or cease its operations. Management is trying to alleviate the going concern risk through the following sources:\n\u25cf\nEquity financing to support its working capital;\n\u25cf\nOther available sources of financing (including debt) from Malaysian banks and other financial institutions; and\n\u25cf\nFinancial support and credit guarantee commitments from the Companys related parties.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its sole subsidiary. All transactions and balances among the Company and its subsidiary have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nSubsidiary is entity in which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting power; or has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of directors.\nEnterprise wide disclosure\nThe Companys chief operating decision-makers (i.e., chief executive officer and his direct reports) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by different revenues streams for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Based on qualitative and quantitative criteria established by ASC 280, Segment Reporting, the Company considers itself to be operating within one reportable segment.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventories obsolescence, useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for deferred tax assets, fair value of convertible note, fair value or valuation of warrants and uncertain tax position. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation and transaction\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nThe reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (US$) and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in US$. The Companys subsidiary in Malaysia conducts its businesses and maintains its books and record in the local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (MYR or RM), as its functional currency.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement\n, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss within the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity. Cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for the periods, therefore, amounts reported on the consolidated statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\nTranslation of foreign currencies into US$1 have been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:\nAs of\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nPeriod-end MYR: US$1 exchange rate\n4.41\n4.15\nFor the years ended\nJune 30,\nPeriod-average MYR: US$1 exchange rate\n4.23\n4.13\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash is carried at cost and represent cash on hand, time deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash equivalents consist of funds received from customer, which funds were held at the third party platforms fund account and which are unrestricted and immediately available for withdrawal and use.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any uncollectible accounts and do not bear interest, which are due after 30 days. Accounts receivable include money due from agent subscription and sales of health care product on its Z-city platform. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical collection trends and aging of receivables. Management also periodically evaluates individual customers financial condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions to make adjustments in the allowance when it is considered necessary. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Companys management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $227 and $25,690 of allowance for doubtful account, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recovered doubtful account from account receivable amounted to $24,953 and $0, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include gift card or E-voucher pin code which are purchased from the Companys suppliers as merchandized goods or store credit. Costs also included health care products which are purchased from the Companys suppliers as merchandized goods. Management compares the cost of inventories with the net realizable value and if applicable, an allowance is made for writing down the inventory to its net realizable value, if lower than cost. On an ongoing basis, inventories are reviewed for potential write-down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories which equals the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions. When inventories are written-down to the lower of cost or net realizable value, it is not marked up subsequently based on changes in underlying facts and circumstances.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, impairments of inventories amounted to $8,805 and $0, respectively, were provided for E-vouchers.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther receivables and other current assets, net\nOther receivables and other current assets primarily include refundable advance to third party service provider and other deposits. Management regularly reviews the aging of receivables and changes in payment trends and records allowances when management believes collection of amounts due are at risk. Accounts considered uncollectable are written off against allowances after exhaustive efforts at collection are made. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, no allowance for doubtful account was recorded.\nPrepayments\nPrepayments and deposits are mainly cash deposited or advanced to suppliers for future inventory purchases. This amount is refundable and bears no interest. For any prepayments determined by management that such advances will not be in receipts of inventories, services, or refundable, the Company will recognize an allowance account to reserve such balances. Management reviews its prepayments on a regular basis to determine if the allowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off against allowance for doubtful accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. The Companys management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there was no allowance for the doubtful accounts.\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets with no residual value. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nExpected useful lives\nComputer and office equipment\n5 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n3-5 years\nMotor vehicles\n5 years\nLeasehold improvement\n3 years\nThe cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred, while additions, renewals and betterments, which are expected to extend the useful life of assets, are capitalized. The Company also re-evaluates the periods of depreciation to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.\nImpairment for long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment is identified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, no impairment of long-lived assets was recognized.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDeferred offering costs\nDeferred offering costs represents costs associated with the Companys initial underwritten public offering on August 15, 2022. The Deferred offering costs would be netted against the proceeds received from the initial underwritten public offering.\nCustomer deposits\nCustomer deposits represent amounts advanced by customers on service order. Customer deposits are reduced when the related sale is recognized in accordance with the Companys revenue recognition policy.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) for all periods presented. The core principle underlying the revenue recognition of this ASU allows the Company to recognize - revenue that represents the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer.\nTo achieve that core principle, the Company applies five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of substantially collection.\nRevenue recognition policies for each type of revenue stream are as follows:\nProduct Revenues\n- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time\nThe Company primarily sells discounted gift cards (or E-vouchers) from retailers, health care products and computer products through individual order directly through the Companys online marketplace platform and its mobile application (Z-City). The Company accounts for the revenue generated from its sales of E-vouchers, health care products and computer products on a gross basis as the Company is acting as a principal in these transactions and is responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods, which the Company has control of the goods and has the ability to direct the use of goods to obtain substantially all the benefits. In making this determination, the Company assesses whether it is primarily obligated in these transactions, is subject to inventory risk, has latitude in establishing prices, or has met several but not all of these indicators in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-36 through 40. The Company determined that it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good as the Company directly purchases and pays for in full the applicable E-voucher, health care products and computer products from the vendors prior to posting of such products for sale on its online marketplace platform and prior to taking any orders for sales of such products. Meanwhile, the Company maintained an average daily inventory of approximately $0.5 million to support an average 2.4 days of sales during the year ended June 30, 2022, which demonstrate the Company had control over the products prior to selling it to the customers as the ownership of the products did not transferred momentarily to the customer after the Company purchased the products from vendors. In addition, the Company cannot return the products to the vendors due to lack of sales which demonstrated that the company is subject to inventory risk, and it has discretion in establishing the price of the products which has demonstrated that the Company has the ability to direct the use of that good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits. The Company also recognized a portion of the product revenues from health care products on a net basis as the product was dropped shipped from the vendors to customers directly which demonstrated that the Company did not had control of the products or bear any inventory risks.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company recognizes the sales of E-vouchers, health care products, and computer products revenue when the control of the specified goods is transferred to its customer. No refund or return policy is provided to the customer. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, approximately $2.8 million and $0.4 million of product revenues are related to non-spending related activities with the same amount recorded as selling expenses, respectively.\nLoyalty Program\n- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time\nThe Companys Z-City reward loyalty program allows members to earn points on purchases that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts on future purchases. When members purchase the Companys product or make purchase with the Companys participated vendor through Z-City, the Company allocate the transaction price between the product and service, and the reward points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the reward points is initially recorded as contract liability and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration.\nThe two primary estimates utilized to record the contract liability for reward points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated breakage. The estimated retail price per point is based on the actual historical retail prices of product purchased or service obtained through the redemption of reward points. The Company estimate breakage of reward points based on historical redemption rates. The Company continually evaluates its methodology and assumptions based on developments in retail price per point redeemed, redemption patterns and other factors. Changes in the retail price per point and redemption rates have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the contract liability through current period revenue by an amount estimated to represent the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period.\nTransactions Revenue\n- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time\nThe transactions revenues primarily consist of fees charged to merchants for participating in Z-City upon successful sales transaction and payment service taken place between the merchants and their customers online.\nThe Company earns transaction revenue from merchants when transactions are completed on certain retail marketplaces. Such revenue is generally determined as a percentage based on the value of merchandise or services being sold by the merchants. In connection with the transaction revenue, the Company offers to share the profit of the transaction (agent commission) to the agents who has referred merchants to participating in Companys online marketplace platform and in Z-City. Transaction revenue is recognized, net of agent commission, in the consolidated statements of operations at the time when the underlying transaction is completed.\nAgent Subscription Revenue\n- Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time\nIn order to attract more merchants to join the Companys online marketplace and in Z-City, the Company provides a right to the agent, an individual or a merchant, to join the Zagent program and assist the Company to develop more merchants to join its merchant network. The agent subscription revenues primarily consist of fees charged to the agents in exchange for the right by introducing merchants to join the Companys merchant network and to earn a future fixed percentage of commission fee upon completion of each sales transaction. As the agent subscription fee is non-refundable, agent subscription revenue is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time when an agent completed the Zagent program training and the remittance of payment of the subscription fee.\nMember Subscription Revenue\n- Performance obligations satisfied over time\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn order to attract more customer to engage with the Companys online marketplace and in Z-City, the Company provides membership subscription to the customers to join the Zmember program, a membership program that provides member with benefits which included exclusive saving, bonus, and referral rewards.\nMember subscription revenue primarily consist of fees charge to customers who sign up for Zmember. As the Company provided customers with 6 months member subscription service in general, member subscription revenue is recognized in the consolidated statement of operation over the time across the subscription period.\nDisaggregated information of revenues by products/services are as follows:\nFor the years ended\nJune 30,\nGift card or E-voucher revenue (1)\n$\n78,739,939\n$\n13,448,430\nHealth care products and computer products revenue (1)\n49,524\n350,455\nLoyalty program revenue (1)\n620,293\n90,485\nTransaction revenue (1)\n53,667\n30,562\nAgent subscription revenue (1)\n100,421\nMember subscription revenue (2)\n211,441\n-\nTotal revenues\n$\n79,674,879\n$\n14,020,353\n(1)\nRevenue recognized at a point in time.\n(2)\nRevenue recognized over time.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues sold mainly consists of the purchases of the gift card or E-voucher pin code, and health care products which is directly attributable to the sales of product on the Companys online marketplace platform.\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs amounted to $4,224,710 and $1,855,000 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOperating leases\nA lease for which substantially all the benefits and risks incidental to ownership remain with the lessor is classified by the lessee as an operating lease. All leases of the Company are currently classified as operating leases. The Company records the total expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses include salaries and other compensation-related expenses to the Companys research and product development personnel, and related expenses for the Companys research and product development team. Research and development expenses amounted to $266,716 and $\n435,471 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDefined contribution plan\nThe full-time employees of the Company are entitled to the government mandated defined contribution plan. The Company is required to accrue and pay for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees respective salaries, subject to certain ceilings, in accordance with the relevant government regulations, and make cash contributions to the government mandated defined contribution plan. Total expenses for the plans were $139,595 and $65,025 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe related contribution plans include:\n-\nSocial Security Organization (SOSCO) - 1.75% based on employees monthly salary capped of RM 4,000;\n-\nEmployees Provident Fund (EPF) - 12% based on employees monthly salary;\n-\nEmployment Insurance System (EIS) - 0.2% based on employees monthly salary capped of RM 4,000;\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with U.S. GAAP for income taxes. The charge for taxation is based on the results for the fiscal year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities.\nAn uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. No penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax for years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware and is required to pay franchise taxes to the State of Delaware on an annual basis.\nThe Company conducts much of its business activities in Malaysia and is subject to tax in its jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to non-employee as an expense in the statements of operations over the requisite service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based award. The fair value of each warrants and common stock granted are estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value is amortized as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model includes various assumptions, including the fair market value of the common stock of the Company, expected life of stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk-free interest rate, among others. These assumptions reflect the Companys best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside the control of the Company.\nAs a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense, as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if the Company uses different assumptions on future grants, stock-based compensation expense could be materially affected in future periods.\nComprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of two components, net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders equity but are excluded from net income. Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of a foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the Company not using the U.S. dollar as its functional currencies.\nLoss per share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share (EPS) in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires companies to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income divided by the weighted average ordinary share outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of the potential ordinary shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential ordinary shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 a total of 3,282,887 and 1,063,560 contingent shares to be issued to the convertible note holders are excluded in the diluted EPS calculation due to its anti-diluted effect, respectively.\nConvertible notes\nThe Company evaluates its convertible notes to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each reporting period and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statements of operations as other income or expense.\nIn circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.\nIf the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provide for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance, this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature (\"BCF\"). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20 \"Debt with Conversion and Other Options.\" In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF, and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt.\nFair value measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe fair value for certain assets and liabilities such as cash, accounts receivable, inventories, other receivables and other current assets, prepayments, accounts payable, customers deposits, other payables and accrued liabilities have been determined to approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The Company believes that its bank loans and convertible notes approximates fair value based on current yields for debt instruments with similar terms.\nRelated parties\nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nReclassification\nCertain items of current and non-current liabilities\nin the consolidated balance sheet and certain items of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the consolidated financial statements for the current period. The reclassification has no impact on the Companys total current and non-current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet, and net cash provided by financing activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates (ASUs). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS Act), the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and has elected the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase the transparency and comparability about leases among entities. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. It also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption assuming the Company will remain an emerging growth company at that date. Early adoption is permitted. In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-13, which to clarify effective dates that public business entities and other entities were required to adopt ASC Topic 842 for annual reporting. A public business entity that otherwise would not meet the definition of a public business entity except for a requirement to include or the inclusion of its financial statements or financial information in another entitys filing with the SEC adopting ASC Topic 842 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. ASU No. 2017-13 also amended that all components of a leveraged lease be recalculated from inception of the lease based on the revised after-tax cash flows arising from the change in the tax law, including revised tax rates. The difference between the amounts originally recorded and the recalculated amounts must be included in income of the year in which the tax law is enacted. The Company has not early adopted this update and it became effective on July 1, 2022 after FASB delayed the effective date for emerging growth companies with ASU 2020-05.\nUpon adoption of this new standard on July 1, 2022, it resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $0.1 million.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. Update 2016-13 also modified the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities, which must be individually assessed for credit losses when fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, in accordance with Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses-Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets. Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13 while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which to update the effective date of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit organizations and certain smaller reporting companies applying for credit losses, leases, and hedging standard. The new effective date for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as an emerging growth company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2019-05 may have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this Update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for (1) public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2022 as the Company is qualified as an emerging growth company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The amendment in this Update is to address issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. For convertible instruments, the Board decided to reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company has not early adopted this update and it will become effective on July 1, 2024 as the Company is qualified as an emerging growth company. The Company believes the adoption of this ASU would have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs.

On January 12, 2021, due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the Malaysian government declared a state of emergency nationwide to combat COVID-19. Intermittent lockdowns were imposed in various states and districts in the country. February 2021 marked a significant month for Malaysia as all frontline staff of the country, which comprised those in healthcare, police, the Volunteers Department of Malaysia, the Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia and civil defense sectors were vaccinated. On February 16, 2021, Prime Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced that a National COVID-19 Immunization Plan will be implemented for one year after February 2021, which 80% of the Malaysia population will be vaccinated to achieve herd immunization. On March 5, 2021, lockdowns in most part of the country was eased to a CMCO, nevertheless, COVID-19 cases in the country continue to rise. On May 12, 2021, Malaysia was again put under a full lockdown nationwide, until the earlier of (i) daily COVID-19 cases infection of the country fall below 4,000; (ii) intensive Unit Care, or ICU, wards start operating at a moderate level; or (iii) 10% of the Malaysian population is fully vaccinated. The country was administering over 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines daily. On July 17, 2021, the full lockdown was slightly eased as 13.9% of the Malaysian population was fully vaccinated, with another 30% having received at least one dose of the vaccine. The COVID-19 situation in the country showed no sign of abating. Kuala Lumpur and Selangor remained the epicenter of the latest wave of infections. Total COVID-19 cases in the country surpassed the one million mark on July 25, 2021, and daily cases hit a record high of 24,599 on August 26, 2021. Despite the deteriorating COVID-19 state, the government lifted Kuala Lumpur from Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) ahead of schedule and ended the nationwide state of emergency on August 1, 2021. Parliament met for the first time this year on July 26, 2021. Malaysia pressed on with its National COVID-19 Immunization Plan, fast inoculating its residents. COVID-19 infection started to drop below the 10,000 mark daily, beginning October 3, 2021. Effective October 11, 2021, interstate and international travel restrictions were lifted for residents who had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as the country achieved its target of inoculating 90% of its adult population. The government is preparing to shift into an endemic COVID-19 phase where it will not impose wide lockdowns even if cases rise. As of September 13, 2022, over 85% of the countrys population have been fully vaccinated\n.\nTREASURE GLOBAL INC.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not, in design and operation, effective as of June 30, 2022 at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below:\n\u00b7\nwe did not have sufficient full-time personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to monitor the daily recording of transactions, address complex United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP;\n\u00b7\nwe lack of a functional internal audit department or personnel that monitors the consistencies of the preventive internal control procedures and lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that our policies and procedures have been carried out as planned;\n\u00b7\nwe lack of proper procedures developed and implemented for IT risk assessment\nand vulnerability management\n;\n\u00b7\nwe lack of proper procedures developed and implemented for access to systems and date, which include user account management and password management;\n\u00b7\nwe lack of proper procedures developed and implemented for segregation of duties and related monitoring; and\n\u00b7\nwe lack of proper procedures identified related party transaction which lead to revision of previously issued financial statements (See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statement footnotes).\n\u00b7\nwe lack of proper procedures developed and implemented for third party IT service vendor risk assessment and management\n.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard AS 2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nFollowing the identification of the material weaknesses, we plan to take remedial measures including:\n\u00b7\nhiring more qualified accounting personnel with relevant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and qualifications to strengthen the financial reporting function and to set up a financial and system control framework;\n\u00b7\nimplementing regular and continuous U.S. GAAP accounting and financial reporting training programs for our accounting and financial reporting personnel;\n\u00b7\ndevelop policies and procedures for IT risk assessment;\n\u25cf\ndevelop policies and procedures for\nuser account management and password management compliance\n;\n\u25cf\ndevelop policies and procedures for IT risk assessment for segregation of duties and related monitoring;\n\u00b7\nestablishing internal audit function by engaging an external consulting firm to assist us with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance requirements and improvement of overall internal control; and\n\u00b7\nstrengthening corporate governance.\nEvaluation of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThis annual report does not include a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from board committees and members of senior management to enable our Board to understand our risk identification, risk management, and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, cybersecurity, strategic, and reputational risk.\nBoard of Directors\nOur business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board consists of five directors, three of whom qualify as independent under the listing standards of Nasdaq.\nDirectors serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve until their successors have been elected and qualified.\nDirector Independence\nOur board of directors are composed of a majority of independent directors as defined under the rules of Nasdaq. We use the definition of independence applied by Nasdaq to make this determination. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Companys Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Nasdaq listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\u00b7\nthe director is, or at any time during the past three (3) years was, an employee of the company;\n\u00b7\nthe director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months within the three (3) years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exemptions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);\n\u00b7\nthe director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exemptions);\n\u00b7\nthe director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three (3) years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the Remuneration Committee of such other entity; or\n\u00b7\nthe director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the companys outside auditor, or at any time during the past three (3) years was a partner or employee of the companys outside auditor, and who worked on the companys audit.\nUnder such definitions, our Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, our Board has determined that Jeremy Roberts, Marco Baccanello and Joseph Bobby Banks are independent directors of the Company.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur Board has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee.
