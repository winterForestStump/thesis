    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nThe Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to VOIP MDU.com in 2004 and subsequently to VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones.\nIn 2013, Voip-Pal acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited (Digifonica), to fund and co-develop Digifonicas patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications - a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\nThe Digifonica patents formed the basis for Voip-Pals current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of issued and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market.\nThe Issuers primary and secondary SIC Codes are 4813 and 4899.\nThe Issuers fiscal year end date is September 30.\nPrincipal Products or Services\nVoIP-PAL owns a worldwide portfolio of issued patents covering numerous inventions, including, but not limited to the following technology areas:\n1. classification and routing of communications over different networks and over geographically distributed nodes;\n2. lawful intercept of such communications;\n3. enhanced emergency calling support (e.g., E911);\n4. mobile gateways;\n5. uninterrupted transmission during endpoint changes; and\n6. metering and billing, including the reselling of white label telecommunication services.\nVoIP-PAL continues to have some patent applications pending.\nVoIP-PAL is currently pursuing patent infringement lawsuits against several Fortune 500 companies that the Company believes are practicing its patented inventions. The status of the litigation is described elsewhere in this report.\nVoIP-Pals Patent Portfolio\nA brief summary of the Companys patents is provided below, focusing primarily on patents which have been issued in the U.S. (however only limited discussion is provided regarding the Companys related pending U.S. patent applications and foreign patent assets).

Lawful intercept\n\u25cf U.S. Patent Nos. 8,422,507; 9,143,608; 9,549,071; and 10,038,779, Canadian Patent No. 2,670,510 and European Patent No. 2,090,024 generally relate to, for example, lawfully intercepting Voice Over IP (VoIP) and other data communications (e.g., when required by law enforcement agencies).\n\u25cf None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation.\n2.1 U.S. Patent No. 8,422,507, issued April 16, 2013, applies, for example, to lawful intercept scenarios in which communications originating in an Internet Protocol (IP) network system from a subscriber to another party occur through a media relay, where information associated with the subscriber profile meets intercept criteria, such that a routing message is produced to cause the media relay to send a copy of the communications to a mediation device.\n2.2 U.S. Patent No. 9,143,608, issued September 22, 2015, applies, for example, to lawful intercept scenarios in which communications originating in an Internet Protocol (IP) network system from a subscriber to another party occur through a media relay, and where a profile associated with the subscriber includes intercept determination information and destination information indicating where to send monitored communications. For example, when intercept criteria are met, at least some of the intercept determination information and the destination information are included in a routing message.\n2.3 U.S. Patent No. 9,549,071, issued January 17, 2017, generally relates to, among other things, lawfully intercepting Internet Protocol (IP) communications between a first party and a second party, where a profile associated with the first or second party includes intercept determination information and destination information for one of the first or second party that is to be monitored, the destination information indicating where to send the monitored communications. For example, when an intercept criterion is met, at least some of the intercept determination information and the destination information is included in a routing message.\n2.4 U.S. Patent No. 10,038,779, issued July 31, 2018, generally relates to lawfully intercepting VoIP or other data communications between a first party and a second party, based on an intercept request message that contains (a) an identification of at least one party whose communications are to be monitored, (b) intercept determination information, and (c) destination information indicating where copies of intercepted communications are to be sent. For example, when an intercept criterion is met, at least some intercept determination information and destination information is included in a routing message.\n2.5 Canadian Patent No. 2,670,510, granted December 22, 2020, also relates to lawful intercept of communication.\n2.6 European Patent No. 2,090,024, granted March 4, 2020, similarly relates to lawful intercept of communications.\n3. Mobile gateway\n\u25cf U.S. Patent No. 8,630,234, U.S. Patent No. 10,880,721, European Patent 2,311,292, and Canadian Patent No. 2,732,148 generally relate to, among other things, methods for channeling communications into distributed VoIP gateways (e.g., allowing roaming mobile devices to establish communications using optimal infrastructure based on a location associated with the mobile devices).\n\u25cf The litigation status of these patents is described elsewhere in this report.\n3.1 U.S. Patent No. 8,630,234, issued January 14, 2014, generally relates to, among other things, a method of roaming with a mobile phone. For example, the mobile phone could receive an access code reply message from the access server that includes a temporary access code allowing the mobile phone to initiate a call to the callee using the access code, allowing the mobile phone to avoid incurring long-distance roaming charges. The access code may be a phone number or an IP address.\n3.2. U.S. Patent No. 10,880,721, issued December 29, 2020, relates among other things, to apparatuses, servers and methods for providing an access code (e.g., IP address) to roaming mobile communication devices such as smartphones, to enable access to suitable communication routing infrastructure, wherein the selection of the communication channel for a call can be optimized based on the calling devices location.\n3.3 Canadian Patent No. 2,732,148, issued April 25, 2018, is directed to, among other things, subject-matter similar to the counterpart U.S. patents (see description above).\n3.4 European Patent No. 2,311,292, issued December 16, 2020, is directed to subject-matter similar to the counterpart U.S. patents above.\n4. Emergency assistance calling\n\u25cf U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,537,805 and 9,565,307 and Canadian Patent No. 2,681,984 generally relate to emergency assistance calling and are applicable, for example, to certain E911 scenarios.\n\u25cf None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation.\n4.1 U.S. Patent No. 8,537,805, issued September 17, 2013, relates to, among other things, handling emergency calls from a caller in a voice over IP (VoIP) system. The \u2018805 Patent could apply, for example, when a routing request message is received and the contents of an emergency call identifier field of a profile match the callee identifier. In this example, if the caller identifier is not associated with a pre-associated identifier, a temporary identifier is associated with the caller. When the emergency call flag is active, for example, a routing message establishes a route between the caller and an emergency response center, the routing message including an emergency response center identifier from a profile associated with the caller and the DID identifier associated with the caller.\n4.2 U.S. Patent No. 9,565,307, issued February 7, 2017, relates to, among other things, routing emergency communications. The \u2018307 Patent could apply, for example, when a routing request includes the caller identifier and the callee identifier, and where the caller identifier identifies a profile associated with the caller that includes an emergency call identifier (e.g., 911) and an emergency response center identifier. In this example, when the callee identifier matches the emergency call identifier, a routing message establishes the call, the routing message having a first portion including the emergency response center identifier and a second portion, which portion may include either a temporary or pre-assigned identifier associated with the caller, for example.\n4.3 Canadian Patent No. 2,681,984, issued April 2, 2019 also relates to routing emergency communications.\n4.4 U.S. Patent No. 11,172,064 relates to similar subject matter. An Issue Notification has been received from the U.S. Patent Office indicating that U.S. Patent No. 11,172,064 will issue on November 9, 2021.\n5. Allocating charges\n\u25cf U.S. Patent Nos. 8,774,378 and 9,998,363 both generally relate to allocating charges for communication services.\n\u25cf None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation.\n5.1 U.S. Patent No. 8,774,378, issued July 8, 2014, could apply, for example, to scenarios where a communication system operator and a reseller of communication services allocate charges incurred by a user. In this example, the process for attributing charges may involve determining a user cost based on a chargeable time and free time associated with the user, where the chargeable time is based on communication session time and a pre-defined billing pattern-then account balances for the user, reseller and system operator are updated accordingly.\n5.2 U.S. Patent No. 9,998,363, issued June 12, 2018, relates to, among other things, attributing charges for communications services provided in a communications system for a communication session between a users device and a destination device.\n5.3 Canadian Patent No. 2,916,220, granted November 26, 2019, also relates to allocating charges.\n6. Determining a time for permitting a communication session\n\u25cf None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation.\n6.1 U.S. Patent No. 9,137,385, issued September 15, 2015, generally relates to, among other things, determining a time for permitting a communication session to be conducted (e.g., a time-to-live or TTL).\n6.2 Canadian Patent No. 2,916,217, issued April 16, 2019, also relates to determining a time for permitting a communication session to be conducted (e.g., a time-to-live or TTL).\n6.3. U.S. Patent No. 11,171,864 relates to similar subject matter. An Issue Notification has been received from the U.S. Patent Office indicating that U.S. Patent No. 11,171,864 will issue on November 9, 2021.\n7. Uninterrupted transmission during endpoint changes\n\u25cf U.S. Patent Nos. 8,675,566; 9,154,417; 10,021,729; European Patent No. 2478678; and Canadian Patent No. 2,812,174 all generally relate to, among other things, uninterrupted transmission during endpoint changes (e.g., station handoffs).\n\u25cf None of these patents are currently asserted in litigation.\n7.1 U.S. Patent No. 8,675,566, issued March 18, 2014, generally relates to, among other things, uninterrupted transmission of internet protocol (IP) transmissions during endpoint changes.\n7.2 U.S. Patent No. 9,154,417, issued October 6, 2015, generally relates to, among other things, uninterrupted transmission, where in response to an IP transmission at a media relay, a session information record is processed in a certain manner.\n7.3 U.S. Patent No. 10,021,729, issued July 10, 2018, generally relates to, among other things, facilitating an uninterrupted internet protocol (IP) communication session, involving internet protocol transmissions between a first entity and a second entity, during endpoint changes.\n7.4 European Patent No. 2,478,678 and Canadian Patent No. 2,812,174 relate to subject matter similar to the aforesaid U.S. patents (see above descriptions).\nNOTE BENE: While the above generalized descriptions of the Companys patents have been provided for convenience, they are provided merely as a rough guide and are not intended to fully characterize the scope of the Companys legal rights. Reviewers are therefore advised to conduct their own legal analysis of the Companys patents and not merely to rely on the above cursory descriptions.\nAmount Spent on Research and Development\nFor the two years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has incurred no research and development expenses.\nEmployees\nWe have two full time employees. The Company utilizes various consultants and contractors for other services.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) and, as such, have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings.\nIn April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:\n- Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;\n- Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;\n- Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;\n- Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and\n- Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.\nIn general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (IPO) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. We will retain emerging growth company status until the earliest of:\n(i) the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,\n(ii) the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the companys IPO;\n(iii) the companys issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or\n(iv) the company becoming a larger accelerated filer as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nThe JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.\nFinancial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:\n(i) audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that smaller reporting companies such as the Company are only required to provide two years of financial statements);\n(ii) selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that smaller reporting companies such as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and\n(iii) executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies\nHowever, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.\nThe JOBS Act also exempts the Companys independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) after the date of the JOBS Acts enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.\nThe JOBS Act further exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Companys accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.\nInternal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in \u00a714A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.\nOther Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the emerging growth companys IPOs.\nSection 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow emerging growth companies to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.\nElection to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.\nThe JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies as described above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, as is currently our plan, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe company qualifies as a smaller reporting company and is not required to provide the information required by this Item.  Item 2. Properties.\nThe Company does not own any properties or facilities. The Company leases office space for operations and administrative purposes. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nThe Company is party to the following legal proceedings:\nPatent Litigation\nThe Company is party to patent and patent-related litigation cases as follows:\ni) VoIP-Pal.com Inc. v.

(Plaintiff(s)) v VoIP-Pal.com Inc. et al (Defendant(s)) (Case No A-20-807745-C) filed in Clark County District Court.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Plaintiffs filed suit in Nevada District Court claiming that they were owed 95,832,000 Voip-Pal common shares from a previous case involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant that had been through a jury trial in 2019, in which the jury had made an award to the Plaintiff that was monetary only, and did not include said shares - following the jurys decision in the 2019 trial, the Plaintiff accepted the award and waived their right to appeal. Voip-Pal vigorously disputed the Plaintiffs 2020 claims on the basis of claim preclusion (the 2020 claims were addressed in the previous action in 2019 and are now precluded); that Plaintiffs claims are untimely, and that the Plaintiffs no longer have standing to bring their claims.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Court entered a judgment in favor of VoIP-Pal.com Inc and co-defendants, dismissing the 2020 case. The Plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Nevada Supreme Court.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, following a hearing of the appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled to reverse the lower courts judgment and remanded the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. The Defendants (Voip-Pal et al) filed a motion to the Supreme Court for reconsideration, however that motion was denied, and a trial date was set for November 28, 2023.\nSubsequent to the year ended September 30, 2023,on November 30, 2023, after the completion of trial, the Eighth Judicial District Court for the State of Nevada rendered its decision in favor of VoIP-Pal upon all claims in the case, ruling that the Plaintiffs had not met their burden of proof with respect to any of its claims against VoIP-Pal et al, awarding no damages to Locksmith and specifically ruling that Locksmith take nothing as a result of the litigation. The case is now closed. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB with the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol VPLM. The OTCQB is an inter- dealer quotation and trading system where market makers apply to quote securities. Accordingly, the OTCQB is not considered a market, and there is, therefore, no public market for our Common Stock.\nHolders\nWe had approximately 575 holders of record of our common stock as of September 30, 2023 according to the books of our transfer agent. The number of our stockholders of record excludes any estimate by us of the number of beneficial owners of shares held in street name, the accuracy of which cannot be guaranteed.\nDividends\nWe have not declared a dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate the payment of dividends in the near future as we intend to reinvest our profits to grow our business. There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:\n\u25cf we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or\n\u25cf our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities, plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nIn order to provide incentive to its directors, officers, management, employees, consultants and others who provide services to the Company or any subsidiary (the Service Providers) to act in the best interests of the Company, and to retain such Service Providers, the Company has in place an incentive Stock Option Plan (the Plan).

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023 and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022 and notes thereto.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis MD&A for the year ending September 30, 2023 contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amending, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amending.

No assurance can be given that any of the assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements specified in the following information are accurate, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nCORPORATE HISTORY, OVERVIEW AND PRINCIPAL BUSINESS\nVoIP-PAL.com Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to VOIP MDI.com in 2004 and subsequently to Voip-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of becoming a Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. All business activities prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit.\nIn 2013, the Company acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited (Digifonica), to fund and co-develop Digifonicas patent suite. Digifonica had been founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications - a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony developed and wrote a software suite with applications that provided solutions for several core areas of internet connectivity. In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. Upon successfully developing the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\nThe Digifonica patents formed the basis for the Companys current intellectual property, now a worldwide portfolio of twenty-six issued and pending patents primarily designed for the broadband VoIP market.\nThe Companys intellectual property value is derived from its issued and pending patents. The inventions described in these patents, among other things, provide the means to integrate VoIP services with legacy telecommunications systems such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to create a seamless service using either legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value of VoIP implementations worldwide.\nVoIP has been and continues to be a green field for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and small across the globe. VoIP is used in many places and by every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale carrier.\nResults of Operations\nThe Companys operating costs consist of expenses incurred to monetizing, selling and licensing its VoIP patents. Other operating costs include expenses for legal, accounting and other professional fees, financing costs, and other general and administrative expenses.\nComparison of the Years Ending September 30, 2023 and 2022\nYear Ended September 30, Increase\n(Decrease) Percentage\nRevenue $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCost of revenue - - - -\nGross margin - - - -\nGeneral and administrative expenses (3,136,404 ) (1,195,619 ) 1,940,785 162 %\nAmortization & depreciation (140,458 ) (140,458 ) - -\nStock based compensation (20,076,567 ) (2,356,339 ) 17,720,228 752 %\nOther (income) 244,420 - 244,420 100 %\nNet loss $ (23,109,009 ) $ (3,692,416 ) $ 19,416,593 526 %\nREVENUES, COST OF REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN\nThe Company had no revenues, cost of revenues or gross margin for the years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ending September 30, 2023 totaled $3,136,404 compared to $1,195,619 during 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $1,940,785 or 162% more than the previous year, was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees and services.\nSTOCK BASED COMPENSATION\nStock-based compensation expense for the year ending September 30, 2023 totaled $20,076,567 compared to $2,356,339 during 2022. The increase in stock-based compensation expense of $17,720,228, or 752% more than the previous year, was primarily due to repricing of the outstanding options from $0.025 to $0.005, repricing and vesting of 2022 warrants of 410,000,000 and additional options and warrant issued and vested during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nAMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION\nAmortization of the intellectual VoIP communications patent properties and depreciation of fixed assets for the year ending September 30, 2023 totaled $140,458 compared to $140,458 for the year ended September 30, 2022. There was no difference between depreciation and amortization expense for the year ending September 30, 2023 as compared to 2022.\nThe Company follows GAAP (FAS 142) and is amortizing its intangibles over an estimated patent life of twelve (12) years. The Company evaluates its intangible assets annually and determines if the fair market value is less than its historical cost. If the fair market value is less, then impairment expense is recorded on the Companys financial statements. The intangible assets on the financial statements of the Company relate primarily to the Companys acquisition of Digifonica (International) Limited.\nOTHER ITEMS\nOther income for the year ending September 30, 2022 totaled $244,420 compared to $Nil during 2022. The increase in other income of $244,420, or 100% more than the previous year, which $59,420 was primarily due to the Company entering into settlement agreements with vendors pursuant to which they relinquished debt owed by the Company, and $185,000 was due to the Company entering into a settlement and release agreement with a party to resolve all aspects of a litigation regarding certain of VoIP-Pals patents.\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe Company had no financing or interest costs for the years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNET LOSS\nThe Company reported a net loss of $23,109,009 for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a net loss of $3,692,416 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in net loss of $19,416,593 or 526% more than the previous year was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation and legal and professional fees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $93,185,588 as compared to an accumulated deficit of $70,076,579 at September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had working capital of $2,198,010 as compared to working capital of $148,053 at September 30, 2022. The increase in the Companys working capital of $2,049,957 is due to proceeds received from a private placement of the Companys stock.\nNet cash used by operations for the years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $3,006,496 and $1,103,768, respectively. The increase in net cash used for operations for the year ending September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ending September 30, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in legal fees and professional services.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $Nil. Net cash provided from financing activities for the years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $4,918,600 and $1,232,750, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities of $3,685,850 was due to equity raised from private placements during the year ending September 30, 2023.\nLiquidity\nThe Company primarily finances its operations from cash received through the private placement of its common stock, settling outstanding debts, and the exercise of warrants from investors. While there can be no assurance that capital will be available as necessary to meet continued developments and operating costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company believes its resources are adequate to fund its operations for the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPerformance Bonus Payable\nIn 2016, the board of directors authorized the Company to provide a performance bonus (the Performance Bonus) of up to 3% of the capital stock of the Company by way of the issuance of Common shares from its treasury to an as yet undetermined group of related and non-related parties upon the occurrence of a bonusable event, defined as the successful completion of a sale of the Company or substantially all its assets, or a major licensing transaction. In order to provide maximum flexibility to the Company with respect to determining the level of Performance Bonus payable, and who may qualify to receive a pro-rata share of such a Performance Bonus, the Company authorized full discretion to the Board in making such determinations.\nIn 2019, the board of directors authorized the increase of the Performance Bonus to up to 10% of the capital stock of the Company. Concurrently, the directors authorized 66.67% of the Performance Bonus to be issued in an advance payment of an aggregate 127,000,000 Common shares (Bonus Shares) to a group of related and non-related parties, which included members of management, a director and several consultants. 60,000,000 of the Bonus Shares are restricted from trading under Rule 144 and subject to voluntary lock-up agreements under which they cannot be traded, pledged, hypothecated, transferred or sold by the holders until such time as the Company has met the requirements of the bonusable event as described above.\nAs at September 30, 2023, no bonusable event had occurred and there was no Performance Bonus payable.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2023. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Its impact on global economies has been far-reaching and businesses around the world are being forced to cease or limit operations for long or indefinite periods of time. Measures taken to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing, and closures of non-essential services have triggered significant disruptions to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown. Global stock markets have also experienced great volatility and significant declines. Governments and central banks have responded with monetary and fiscal interventions to stabilize economic conditions.\nThe duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of government and central bank responses, remains unclear at this time. It is not possible to reliably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, nor its impact on the financial position and results of the Company in future periods. The Company is proceeding with its business activities as long as the work environment remains safe - at this point there has been minimal disruption to day-to-day operations resulting from health and safety measures. Disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets may increase the Companys cost of capital and adversely impact access to capital. Item 7A.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS\nVOIP-PAL.com, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. The Companys registered office is located at 7215 Bosque Blvd, Suite 102, Waco, Texas in the United States of America.\nSince March 2004, the Company has developed technology and patents related to Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) processes. All business activities prior to March 2004 have been abandoned and written off to deficit. The Company operates in one reportable segment being the acquisition and development of VoIP-related intellectual property including patents and technology. All intangible assets are located in the United States of America.\nIn December 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Digifonica (International) Limited, a private company controlled by the CEO of the Company, whose assets included several patents and technology developed for the VoIP market.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in various stages of product development and continues to incur losses and, as at September 30, 2023, had an accumulated deficit of $93,185,588 (September 30, 2022 - $70,076,579). The ability of the Company to continue operations as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional working capital, settling outstanding debts and the exercise of warrants from investors. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Should the going concern assumption not continue to be appropriate, further adjustments to carrying values of assets and liabilities may be required. There can be no assurance that capital will be available as necessary to meet these continued developments and operating costs or, if the capital is available, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. The issuances of additional stock by the Company may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of its current shareholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase the Companys liabilities and future cash commitments. If the Company is unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable, its business and future success may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, as the Companys stated objective is to monetize its patent suite through the licensing or sale of its intellectual property (IP), the Company being forced to litigate or to defend its IP claims through litigation casts substantial doubt on its future to continue as a going concern. IP litigation is generally a costly process, and in the absence of revenue the Company must raise capital to continue its own defense and to validate its claims - in the event of a failure to defend its patent claims, either because of lack of funding, a court ruling against the Company or because of a protracted litigation process, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital to pay for an appeals process or a lengthy trial. The outcome of any litigation process may have a significant adverse effect on the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nCOVID-19\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 had resulted in worldwide emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. These measures, including significant restrictions on commercial activity, have adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn. However, starting in the second half year of 2022, restrictions have been gradually eased, and while variants of COVID-19 continue to emerge, it appears that much of the impact of the pandemic on business may now be behind us. A new potential challenge is the impact of inflationary economic conditions on business activity but the consequences of this for the Companys business are not yet clear.\nNOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).\nVOIP-PAL.COM INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Expressed in United States Dollars)\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Digifonica. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. As at September 30, 2023, Digifonica had no activities.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Where estimates have been used, financial results as determined by actual events could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant accounting estimates used in the preparation of the companys financial statements include deferred income taxes, the valuation of equity-related instruments issued, and the useful life and impairment of intangible assets.\nCash\nCash consists of cash on hand, cash held in trust, and monies held in checking and savings accounts. The Company had $2,217,589 in cash on September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022 - $305,485).\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives; Furniture and computers - 5 years.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets, consisting of VoIP communication patent intellectual properties (IP) are recorded at cost and amortized over the assets estimated life on a straight-line basis. Management considers factors such as remaining life of the patents, technological usefulness and other factors in estimating the life of the assets.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by management of the Company at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event which may indicate that the carrying amount may be less than its fair value. If impaired, the Company will write- down such impairment. In addition, the useful life of the intangible assets will be evaluated by management at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event which may indicate that the useful life may have changed.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.\nThe Company classifies financial assets and liabilities as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables or other financial liabilities depending on their nature. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized at fair value on their initial recognition, except for those arising from certain related party transactions which are accounted for at the transferors carrying amount or exchange amount.\nFinancial assets and liabilities classified as held-for-trading are measured at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in net income. Financial assets classified as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and financial liabilities other than those classified as held-for-trading are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method of amortization. Financial assets classified as available-for-sale are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being recognized as other comprehensive income until realized, or if an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary, the unrealized loss is recorded in income.\nU.S. GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard describes the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:\nVOIP-PAL.COM INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Expressed in United States Dollars)\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTD)\n- Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n- Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n- Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe fair value of cash is classified as Level 1 at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company classifies its financial instruments as follows: Cash is classified as held for trading and is measured at fair value. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, and have a fair value approximating their carrying value, due to their short-term nature.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting under the asset and liability method, using expected tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when realization is not considered more likely than not.\nThe Companys policy is to classify income tax assessments, if any, for interest expense and for penalties in general and administrative expenses. The Companys income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and corresponding states, generally for three years after they are filed.\nLoss per Common Share\nBasic loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted income per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants outstanding during each period. To calculate diluted loss per share, the Company uses the treasury stock method and the if-converted method.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended September 30, 2023, there were no potentially dilutive securities included in the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding.\nDerivatives\nWe account for derivatives pursuant to ASC 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. All derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. We determine fair value of warrants and other option-type instruments based on option pricing models. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in income or expense.\nPreferred Shares\nThe preferred shares carry super-voting rights with each shared issued having the equivalent of 1,550 votes. Preferred shares issued by the Company are not convertible into or exchangeable for common shares and they are not exchangeable for equity nor redeemable for cash. The preferred shares do not pay dividends. The preferred shares cannot be sold, exchanged or transferred to another party.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees, directors and others based on the estimated fair values of its common stock on the date of issuance.\nThe Company determines the fair value of the stock-based compensation payments granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instrument is reached or the date the performance is complete.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards with service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is included in operations. Stock option expense is recognized over the options vesting period.\nVOIP-PAL.COM INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Expressed in United States Dollars)\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTD)\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Companys policy is to maintain cash with reputable financial institutions or in retainers with trusted vendors. The Company has at times had cash balances at financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Insurance Limit of\n$250,000; however, has not experienced any losses to date as a result. As of September 30, 2023, the Companys bank operating account balances exceeded the FDIC Insurance Limit of $250,000 by $1,967,589.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Adoption\nASU 2020-10 - Codification Improvements. In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements. The guidance contains improvements to the Codification by ensuring that all guidance that requires or provides an option for an entity to provide information in the notes to financial statements is codified in the Disclosure Section of the Codification. The guidance also contains Codifications that are varied in nature and may affect the application of the guidance in cases in which the original guidance may have been unclear. For public business entities, the amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has adopted the updated standard for the year ended September 30, 2023, which did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nThe FASB issues ASUs to amend the authoritative literature in ASC. There have been a number of ASUs to date, including those above, that amend the original text of ASC. Management believes that those issued to date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are not applicable to us or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 4. PURCHASE OF DIGIFONICA\nThe Company acquired Digifonica in December 2013. Pursuant to the terms in the Share Purchase Agreement (the SPA), the Company acquired 100% of Digifonica from the seller, the CEO of the Company (the Seller), for a cash payment of $800,000 and 389,023,561 common shares of the Company. The assets acquired through the acquisition were VoIP-related patented technology, including patents for Lawful Intercept, routing, billing and rating, mobile gateway, advanced interoperability solutions, intercepting voice over IP communications, and uninterrupted transmission of internet protocol transmissions during endpoint changes.\nThe SPA included an anti-dilution clause (the Anti-Dilution Clause) that required the Company to maintain the Sellers percentage ownership of the Company at 40% by issuing the Seller a proportionate number of common shares of any future issuance of the Companys common shares. Shares issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause were recorded as a share issuance cost within the Additional Paid-in Capital account (Notes 8 and 10).\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, on April 12, 2021, the SPA was amended to provide that: a) from its inception until March 31, 2021, the Company would issue warrants to purchase common shares of the Company in an equivalent amount to and instead of the required shares being issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause; and b) the Anti-Dilution Clause would be null and void from April 1, 2021 forward. As a result of this amendment, the Seller returned 513,535,229 common shares to the treasury of the Company and relinquished his right to receive an additional 107,935,333 common shares in exchange for 621,470,562 warrants to purchase common shares at a price of $0.021 for a period of ten years from the date of issue.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, on April 23, 2023, the SPA was further amended to: a) retroactively reinstate the Anti-Dilution Clause that had been nullified by the amendments made to the STA in April 2021 so that the Company is now required to issue warrants to purchase common shares of the Company in an equivalent amount to and instead of the required shares being issued pursuant to the original Anti-Dilution Clause; and b) require the Company to issue preferred shares with super-voting rights in a sufficient amount in order for the Seller to maintain his 40% voting rights in the Company while his warrants issued pursuant to the original and reinstated Anti-Dilution Clause remain unexercised (2023 Amendments). Each of the warrant issuance and the preferred share issuance required under the 2023 Amendments are to occur at the close of each quarterly reporting period. As a result of the 2023 Amendments, the Seller was issued 831,466,899 share purchase warrants and 138,420 series A preferred shares on June 30, 2023. Shares and warrants issued pursuant to the Anti-Dilution Clause are recorded as a share issuance cost within the additional paid-in capital account (Notes 8 and 10).\nVOIP-PAL.COM INC.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Expressed in United States Dollars)\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNOTE 5. RETAINER\nThe Company has retainers with certain of its professional service providers. The balance due on these prepaid retainers was $36,183 as of September 30, 2023, and $1,181 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company recognizes the expense from these retainers as they are invoiced, and the invoiced charges are deducted from the various providers prepaid retainer balances.\nNOTE 6. FIXED ASSETS\nA summary of the Companys fixed assets as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 is as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF FIXED ASSETS\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nOffice furniture & computers $ 11,917 $ 11,917\nAccumulated depreciation (9,785 ) (7,527 )\nNet book value $ 2,132 $ 4,390\nThere were no retirements of any fixed assets in the years presented.\nNOTE 7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe Company acquired certain patents and technology from Digifonica in December 2013 (see Note 4). These assets have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as intangible assets. These assets are being amortized over twelve (12) years on a straight-line basis. A summary of intangible assets as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 is as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nVoIP Intellectual property and patents $ 1,552,416 $ 1,552,416\nAccumulated amortization (1,325,866 ) (1,187,666 )\nNet book value $ 226,550 $ 364,750\nThere were no disposals of any intangible assets in the years presented.\nNOTE 8.

The case is now closed.\nPerformance Bonus Payable\nIn 2016, the board of directors authorized the Company to provide a performance bonus (the Performance Bonus) of up to 3% of the capital stock of the Company by way of the issuance of Common shares from its treasury to an as yet undetermined group of related and non-related parties upon the occurrence of a bonusable event, defined as the successful completion of a sale of the Company or substantially all its assets, or a major licensing transaction. In order to provide maximum flexibility to the Company with respect to determining the level of Performance Bonus payable, and who may qualify to receive a pro-rata share of such a Performance Bonus, the Company authorized full discretion to the Board in making such determinations.\nIn 2019, the board of directors authorized the increase of the Performance Bonus to up to 10% of the capital stock of the Company, and also authorized 66.67% of the Performance Bonus to be issued in an advance payment of an aggregate 127,000,000 Common shares (Bonus Shares) to members of management, a director and several consultants. 30,000,000 of the issued Bonus Shares continue to be restricted from trading under Rule 144 and subject to a voluntary lock-up agreement under which they cannot be traded, transferred, pledged or sold by the holders until such time as the Company has met the requirements of the bonusable event as described above.\nAs at September 30, 2023 and 2022, no bonusable event has occurred and there was no Performance Bonus payable. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting or financial disclosure matters. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a companys internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring. In managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), our management concluded as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting has not been completely efficient. The Company intends to address this deficiency in internal controls as soon as possible.\nAs defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule and Conforming Amendments, established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of September 30, 2023:\n1) Lack of segregation of duties. Now, our resources and size prevent us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have adequate segregation of duties within our internal control system. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.\n2) Lack of an independent audit committee. Although the Board of Directors has an audit committee it is not comprised solely of independent directors. We may establish an audit committee comprised solely of independent directors when we have sufficient capital resources and working capital to attract qualified independent directors and to maintain such a committee.\n3) Insufficient number of independent directors. Now, our Board of Directors does not consist of a majority of independent directors, a factor that is counter to corporate governance practices as set forth by the rules of various stock exchanges.\n4) Insufficient period-end balance sheet reconciliations and review of journal entries. Due to our size, we have insufficient accounting staff resources to review accounting entries on a timely basis. Management will periodically reevaluate this situation.\n5) No formal codes of conduct. Due to our management remote working in different locations, we can not ensure that our management involve in day-to-day operations and regular communications of ethical and appropriate behavior.\nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entitys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nOur management determined that if these deficiencies persist they could constitute material weaknesses. Due to a lack of financial resources, we are not able to immediately take any action to remediate these potential material weaknesses. We will not be able to do so until we acquire sufficient financing to do so. We will implement further controls as circumstances, cash flow, and working capital permit. Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not entirely efficient and that there were potential material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the years covered thereby in all material respects.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such controls.
