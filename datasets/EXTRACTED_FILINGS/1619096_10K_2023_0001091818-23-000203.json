(together with its subsidiary, the \"Company\") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2014. Originally, the Company was formed to engage in the distribution of glass craft products produced in China. On May 8, 2018, we acquired Real Capital Limited, a Hong Kong company (\"Real Capital\"), to seek opportunities in the food and beverage industry. On March 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the \"Real Capital SPA\") pursuant to which it sold its interests in Real Capital. The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred on April 10, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we generated no revenues. We generated $182,140 in passive revenues during the period ending September 30, 2023. Our operating expenses for the same periods were comprised of general and administrative expenses of $165,362 and $108,205, respectively, resulting in net income of $23,778 for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a net loss of $108,205 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Our general and administrative expenses consisted of mainly professional fees for the year ended September 30, 2023, and the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase of general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the increase of salaries and wages, rent, and professional fees.\nOur total assets as of September 30, 2023 were $179,828.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had 67,139,990 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were total debts of $679,000 and $579,000 respectively, due to related parties. These debts are interest free, unsecured and payable on demand.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a negative cash flow of $59,305 and $72,049, respectively. The Company's principal sources and uses of funds were as follows:\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company used $59,305 in cash for operations as compared to $72,049 for the year ended September 30, 2022, respectively. Such decrease was primarily due to lower net loss in year ended September 30, 2023. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $200,090, as compared to zero for the year ended September 30, 2022. Such increase was a result of capital raised from the issuance of common shares.\nThe Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's liquidity and capital needs relate primarily to working capital and other general corporate requirements. As of September 30, 2023, we had $149,614 in cash and the outstanding liabilities were $702,847. As of September 30, 2022 we had cash of $8,829 and there were outstanding liabilities of $771,167. Stockholders deficits were $538,470 and $762,338, for September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These factors raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, as discussed in the footnotes to our financial statements. However, the companys management team has established a new plan for financing the Companys operations in the short run, consisting of financial support by our current shareholders and management. The Company is currently working with other entities to develop a new business plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Summit Networks Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Summit Networks Inc (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the two years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and schedule (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception) to September 30, 2023 resulting in accumulated deficit of $1,194,477 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company will generate revenue and net income in the future. At September 30, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $538,470. The cash used in operating activities were $59,305. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Assentsure PAC\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\nSingapore\nDecember 22, 2023\nPCAOB ID No: 6783\nSUMMIT NETWORKS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Audited)\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS \u3000 \u3000\nCurrent Assets:\nCash & cash equivalents $ 149,614 $ 8,829\nDeposits 12,545 -\nPrepayments 2,218 -\nTotal Current Assets 164,377 8,829\nNon-Current Asset:\nFixed assets, net - -\nTotal Non-Current Asset - -\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 164,377 $ 8,829\n\u3000 \u3000 \u3000\nLIABILITIES & STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nCurrent Liabilities: \u3000 \u3000\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 123,847 $ 176,167\nAccounts payable - related parties\n- 16,000\nDue to related parties 579,000 579,000\nTotal Current Liabilities 702,847 771,167\nCommitments and Contingencies - -\nStockholders Deficit:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized; 0 share issued and outstanding - -\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, 500,000,000 shares authorized; 67,139,990 and 62,049,990 issued and outstanding as of September 30,2023 and 2022, respectively. 67,140 62,050\nAdditional paid-in capital 588,867 393,867\nAccumulated deficit (1,194,477 ) (1,218,255 )\nTotal Stockholders Deficit (538,470 ) (762,338 )\nTOTAL LIABILITIES & STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT $ 164,377 $ 8,829\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSUMMIT NETWORKS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Audited)\nFor years ended,\nSeptember 30,\nRevenue $ - $ -\nOther Income:\nRental income 1,250 -\nInterest income 1,900 -\nMiscellaneous income 3,324 -\nGain on debt forgiveness 182,666 -\nTotal Other income: $ 189,140 -\nOperating Expenses: \u3000 \u3000\nGeneral and administrative expenses 165,362 108,205\nLoss from operations (165,362 ) (108,205 )\nNet Income (Loss) $ 23,778 $ (108,205 )\n\u3000\nBasic Net Income (loss) per share $ 0.00 $ (0.00 )\nDiluted Net Income (loss) per share $ 0.00 $ (0.00 )\n\u3000 \u3000 \u3000\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding 67,139,990 62,049,990\n\u3000 \u3000 \u3000\nDiluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding 67,139,990 62,049,990\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSUMMIT NETWORKS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\n(Audited)\nCommon Stock\nShares Amount Additional\nPaid-in\nCapital\nAccumulated\nDeficit\nTotal\nBalance, September 30, 2021 62,049,990 $ 62,050 393,867 $ (1,110,050 ) $ (654,133 )\nNet loss - - - (108,205 ) (108,205 )\nBalance, September 30, 2022 62,049,990 $ 62,050 393,867 $ (1,218,255 ) $ (762,338 )\nIssuance of new shares 5,090,000 5,090 195,000 - 200,090\nNet income - - - 23,778 23,778\nBalance, September 30, 2023 67,139,990 $ 67,140 588,867 $ (1,194,477 ) $ (538,470 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSUMMIT NETWORKS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Audited)\nFor years ended\nSeptember 30,\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: \u3000 \u3000\nNet income/(loss) $ 23,778 $ (108,205 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation of fixed assets - 3,322\nGain on debt forgiveness (182,666 ) -\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities: \u3000 \u3000\nDeposits (12,545 ) -\nPrepayments (2,218 ) -\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses 114,346 32,834\nNet cash used in operating activities (59,305 ) (72,049 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITY:\nProceed from share issuance $ 200,090 $ -\nNet cash generated from financing activity 200,090 -\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 140,785 (72,049 )\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 8,829 80,878\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 149,614 $ 8,829\n\u3000 \u3000\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid during the period for:\nInterest $ - $ -\nIncome Taxes $ - $ -\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSUMMIT NETWORKS INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNOTE 1.

The closing of the Real Capital SPA occurred on April 10, 2019.\nOn May 8, 2020, Sumnet (Canada) Inc. (\"Sumnet (Canada)\") was incorporated in Canada. Sumnet (Canada) issued all its ordinary shares to the Company on May 8, 2020, so that Sumnet (Canada) became the wholly owned subsidiary of Company.

Green Energy issued all its ordinary shares to Smith Barney on August 28, 2020 so that Green Energy became the wholly owned subsidiary of Smith Barney.

Green Energy subscribed all capital stock of Beijing ALW on September 27, 2020 so that Beijing ALW became the wholly owned subsidiary of Green Energy.\nOn January 20, 2021, Beijing ALW and Green Energy entered into a series of contractual agreements (the \"VIE Agreement\") with Hengshui Jingzhen Environmental Company Limited (\"Hengshui Jingzhen\", or the \"VIE\"), whereby Beijing ALW gained control over Hengshui Jingzhen, a P.R.

On March 29, 2021, the board of directors and a majority shareholder of the Company approved the termination of the VIE Agreements with Hengshui Jingzhen. On the same date, Beijing ALW, Hengshui Jingzhen, and Hengshui Jingzhen's shareholders entered into a Termination Agreement (the \"Termination Agreement\") to terminate all existing VIE Agreements signed on January 20, 2021. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, all of the rights and obligations under the existing VIE Agreements were terminated and the Company no longer had control of Hengshui Jingzhen. See NOTE 4. EXECUTION AND TERMINATION OF VIE AGREEMENTS.\nOn July 17, 2019, the Company received FINRA approval to effect a 10-for-1 stock dividend to holders of its common stock as of June 1, 2019, the record date for the dividend.

GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.\nThe Company had limited operations during the period from July 8, 2014 (date of inception) to September 30, 2023, resulting in accumulated deficit of $1,194,477 and has not generated any revenue. There is no guarantee that Company will generate revenue and net income in the future.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $538,470. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the undertaking of its shareholders to provide continuing financial support to enable the Company to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due.\nThe Company actively looks for new business opportunities, and its operating expenses are solely relied on loans from the shareholders.\nNOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are on deposit with financial institutions without any restrictions. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, cash equivalents amounted to $149,614 and $8,829 respectively.\nFixed Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related capitalized assets.\nRelated parties\nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, \"Accounting for Income Taxes\". The asset and liability method provide that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nNet loss per share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\nFair Value\nASC 740 provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. If the Company determines that an uncertain tax position exists in which the Company could incur income taxes, the Company would evaluate whether there is a probability that the uncertain tax position taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. A liability for uncertain tax positions would then be recorded if the Company determined it is more likely than not that a position would not be sustained upon examination or if a payment would have to be made to a taxing authority and the amount is reasonably estimable. The Company does not believe any uncertain tax positions exist that would result in the Company having a liability to the taxing authorities. The Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of interest expense and other expense in the statements of operations. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\", which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.\nThe estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable\nLevel 3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued, which may be in advance of their effective date. The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.\nNOTE 4.

China company, which provides integrated hazardous waste management services, including collecting, transferring, disposing, and recycling of hazardous waste, primarily in Hebei, China. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in which the Company was the legal acquirer and Hengshui Jingzhen was the accounting acquirer.\nOn March 29, 2021, due to changes of the Company's business plan, the board of directors and a majority shareholder of the Company approved the termination of the VIE Agreements with Hengshui Jingzhen. On the same date, Beijing ALW, Hengshui Jingzhen, and Hengshui Jingzhen's shareholders entered into a Termination Agreement to terminate all existing VIE Agreements signed on January 20, 2021.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAt the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(e) and Rule 15d - 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nDisclosure controls and procedures were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Companys internal control of financial reporting as discussed below.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Companys management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, because management identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below.\nWhile the Company does adhere to internal controls and processes that were designed and implemented based on the COSO report, it is difficult with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements; (ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, we determined that this control deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected.\nManagements Remediation Initiatives.\nManagement has evaluated, and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely mitigate internal control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization at the current time. Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal control processes that have been and continue to be in use at the Company.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Companys most recent financial quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
