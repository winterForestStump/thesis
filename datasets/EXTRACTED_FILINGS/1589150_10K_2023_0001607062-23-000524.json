    "content": "Item 1. Business\nWe were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which we intend to license, develop internally or acquire outright from other entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy seen in Phase I trials.\nAs of September 15, 2023 we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed.\nPatents and Patent Applications:\nThe following is a list of intellectual property (IP) controlled by either Regen Biopharma, Inc.

David Koos serves as sole officer and director of both Regen BioPharma, Inc. and Zander Therapeutics Inc.\nBoth Zander and Oncology Pharma, Inc. will be required to obtain approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to market any Licensed Product which may be developed within the United States and no assurance may be given that such approval would be granted.\nPrincipal Products and Services\nThe Company has begun development of HemaXellerate, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate is a patient-specific composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based in previous animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells and platelets).\nAdipose tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), a mix of various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are connective tissue cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types and endothelial cells are the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels and which play a vital role in angiogenesis (the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels).\nThe isolated SVF is then intravenously administered to the patient. The Company believes that the isolated SVF will generate growth factors with the ability to repair damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are immature cells that can develop into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow.\nOn February 5, 2013 Regen filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous SVF cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a previously unapproved drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The sponsor of the product would also be entitled to a United States federal tax credit equal to 50% of clinical investigation expenses as well as exemptions from certain fees.\nThe Company believes that this application of HemaXellerate qualifies for Orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act due to the fact that aplastic anemia is a rare disease with prevalence in the United States of less than 200,000 and intends to apply to the FDA for Orphan designation for HemaXellerate.\nOn December 10, 2015 Regen was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues related to Regens Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.\ndCellVax is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body, treated with siRNA that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and subsequently reimplanted in the cancer patient.\nThe dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking RNA become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce factors which cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO. Expression of IDO in the dendritic cell halts the dendritic cell from activating T cells and causes the dendritic cell to suppress T cells. T lymphocytes (\u2018T cells) are a lymphocyte that play a central role in the human immune systems attempt to eradicate tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast cancer. The proposed trial will recruit 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months.\nOn May 12, 2021 the Company executed a consulting agreement with Biotech Research Group Corporation, an FDA Specialist Group and Global Regulatory and Scientific Experts, for the purpose of review and guidance with regard to the planned reinstatement of the Companys inactive Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) #15376 (HemaXellerate) and #16200 (dCellVax) filed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The securing of the services to be provided to the Company pursuant to this consulting agreement marks the first step taken by the Company with regard to activating the Companys currently inactive applications to initiate clinical trials.\ntCellVax is intended to be a therapy where immune cells are removed from the cancer patient, treated with siRNA which inhibits NR2F6 and the cells re-infused to the patient. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated. The immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking siRNA become highly activated and can efficiently kill tumors.. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing safety and feasibility of the dCellVax gene-silenced immune cell immunotherapy for treating patients with solid tumors that are metastatic or not able to be removed surgically. The proposed trial will recruit 25 patients with metastatic cancer and will involve 3 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months.\nDiffronC: NR2F6 is a transcription factor that is present in many cells in the body, including immune cells but also highly expressed in certain solid tumors. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells to keep growing. The Company has developed a proprietary drug that is based on shRNA technology, which prevents NR2F6 from being expressed. By inhibiting the expression of NR2F6, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking shRNA become highly activated and can efficiently kill tumors and tumors that have NR2F6 suppressed begin to differentiate.. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug to optimize its delivery in vivo.\nDuraCar: DuraCar is a new cellular therapy being developed by the Company. It is comprised of CAR-T cells which contain an shRNA targeting the gene NR2F6. CAR-T cells are T cells (the lymphoid cells of the body that kill tumors) isolated from a cancer patient that have been modified by expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which is specific for the patients tumor. These CAR-T cells are then re-infused back into the patient. The CAR-T cells then home in directly on the tumor because they have been given the tumor-specific address via the CAR. While CAR-T cells are very effective in treating leukemias, they are not effective at treating most solid tumors. The reason for this is believed to be that the CAR-T cells are turned-off by the physical environment surround solid tumors. By inhibiting NR2F6, we expect our DuraCar cells to have greater efficacy and persistence than conventional CAR-T cells and create a new, optimal way to manufacture CAR-T cells. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug.\nExperiments performed on behalf of the Company by two unrelated contract research organizations (CROs) found that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 had high expression levels of NR2F6 mRNA. NR2F6 is considered an immune checkpoint and thus increasing its activity is likely to lead to immune suppression which may be utilized in the development of therapies for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.\nSmall molecule: We have identified and patented a series of small molecules which can both activate and inhibit NR2F6. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells to keep growing. By inhibiting the function of NR2F6 using small molecules, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking agents, similar to using the shRNA approach, should become highly activated and efficiently kill tumors. In addition, tumors that have NR2F6 blocked by using these small molecules should begin to differentiate. Conversely, activating NR2F6 is expected to suppress the immune system. This ability to suppress the immune system can be very useful for treating autoimmune disorders. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of these drugs.\nNone of the abovementioned statements regarding any of our products in development are intended to be a prediction or conclusion of efficacy. No clinical trials on our product candidates have commenced so no conclusions of efficacy can be made.\nResearch Conducted\nThe Company has begun development of HemaXellerate, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate is a patient-specific composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based in previous animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells and platelets).\nAdipose tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), a mix of various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells.

The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.\nThe costs to perform this Phase I clinical trial is estimated to be approximately $5,000,000 and it is estimated to take 1 year to complete.\nThe company is developing another cell therapy product termed dCellVax. dCellVax is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body, treated with siRNA that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and subsequently reimplanted in the cancer patient.\nThe dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking RNA become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce factors which cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO.

The proposed trial will recruit 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to cost $5,000,000 and last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months.\nOn May 12, 2021 the Company executed a consulting agreement with Biotech Research Group Corporation, an FDA Specialist Group and Global Regulatory and Scientific Experts, for the purpose of review and guidance with regard to the planned reinstatement of the Companys inactive Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) #15376 (HemaXellerate) and #16200 (dCellVax) filed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The securing of the services to be provided to the Company pursuant to this consulting agreement marks the first step taken by the Company with regard to activating the Companys currently inactive applications to initiate clinical trials.\nAnother cell therapy that focuses on a different mechanism of action than dCellVax is tCellVax. tCellVax is intended to be a therapy in which immune cells are removed from the cancer patient, treated with siRNA which inhibits NR2F6 and the cells re-infused to the patient. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated.

We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug to optimize its delivery in vivo. The two main risks associated with this drug development plan is that the NR2F6 siRNA is not effective at inhibiting NR2F6 expression or that this inhibition will not result in immune cells with enhanced tumoricidal activity.\nDuraCar: DuraCar is a new cellular therapy being developed by the Company. It is comprised of CAR-T cells which contain an shRNA targeting the gene NR2F6. CAR-T cells are T cells (the lymphoid cells of the body that kill tumors) isolated from a cancer patient that have been modified by expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which is specific for the patients tumor.

By inhibiting NR2F6, we expect our DuraCar cells to have greater efficacy and persistence than conventional CAR-T cells and create a new, optimal way to manufacture CAR-T cells. We have engaged two contract research organizations to advance our pre-clinical testing of this drug. Pre-clinical testing includes design and construction of the relevant plasmids, efficient transfection of T cells, assessment of the expression levels of the siRNA directed at NR2F6 and measurement of its effectiveness at inhibition of NR2F6 expression. Then, these cells will be analyzed for enhanced tumor-killing activity. The two main risks associated with this drug development plan is that the NR2F6 siRNA is not effective at inhibiting NR2F6 expression or that this inhibition will not result in a T cell with enhanced tumoricidal activity. Successful completion of these pre-clinical experiments will significantly de-risk the project.\nExperiments performed on behalf of the Company by two unrelated contract research organizations (CROs) found that T cells which express the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct targeting CD19 and expressing siRNA for NR2F6 had high expression levels of NR2F6 mRNA. NR2F6 is considered an immune checkpoint and thus increasing its activity is likely to lead to immune suppression which may be utilized in the development of therapies for the treatment of autoimmune disorders\nSmall Molecule Drugs: We have identified and patented a series of small molecules which can both activate and inhibit NR2F6. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells to keep growing. By inhibiting the function of NR2F6 using small molecules, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking agents, similar to using the shRNA approach, should become highly activated and efficiently kill tumors. In addition, tumors that have NR2F6 blocked by using these small molecules should begin to differentiate. Conversely, activating NR2F6 is expected to suppress the immune system. This ability to suppress the immune system can be very useful for treating autoimmune disorders. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of these drugs.\nDistribution methods of the products or services:\nIt is anticipated that Regen and /or KCL will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Regen and/or KCL may obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize.\nCompetitive business conditions and Regens competitive position in the industry and methods of competition\nWe have yet to achieve significant revenues or profits. The pharmaceutical and biologics industries in which we intend to compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advancement. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do.\nWe intend to be competitive by utilizing the services and advice of individuals that we believe have expertise in their field in order that we can concentrate our resources on projects in which products and services in which we have the greatest potential to secure a competitive advantage may be developed and commercialized. The Companys intent is to enter into nonemployee consulting agreements with individuals who we believe have a high level of expertise in their professional fields and who have agreed to provide counsel and assistance to us in (a) determining the viability of proposed projects (b) obtaining financing for projects and (c) obtaining the resources required to initiate and complete a project in the most cost effective and rapid manner.\nSources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers\nThe supplies and materials required to conduct our operations are available through a wide variety of sources and may be obtained through a wide variety of sources.\nNeed for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics.\nOur domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.\nPhase I\nPhase 1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options.\nPhase II\nPhase II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups.\nPhase III\nPhase III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) label expansion (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product.\nOn occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.\nAll phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA) or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval.\nEven after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible.\nThe FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.\nSales of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval\nAmount spent during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 on research and development activities\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 we expended $175,388 on research and development activities.\nCosts and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local)\nRegen has not incurred any unusual or significant costs to remain in compliance with any environmental laws and does not expect to incur any unusual or significant costs to remain in compliance with any environmental laws in the foreseeable future.\nNumber of total employees and number of full-time employees\nAs of November 7, 2023 the Company has 1 full time employee.   Item 2. Properties\nThe Company currently occupies 2,320 square feet of office space at 4700 Spring Street, Suite 304, La Mesa, California 91942. The property is utilized as office space. We believe that the foregoing properties are adequate to meet our current needs for office space.\nOn January 13, 2022 Regen Biopharma, Inc. entered into a sublease agreement with BST Partners (BST) whereby Regen Biopharma, Inc. would sublet the aforementioned office space located at 4700 Spring Street, Suite 304, La Mesa, California 91942 from BST on a month to month basis for $5,000 per month beginning January 14, 2022.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders\nNo matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report to a vote of security holders, through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Companys common stock is a \"penny stock,\" as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell common stock of the Company.\nThe par value of our common stock is $0.0001.

The large disparity in Operating Losses is primarily attributable to $606,237 in Consulting and Professional fees expensed during the period ended 2023 although all operating expenses (with the exception of total Research and Development expenses) were greater during the twelve months ended 2023 as compared to the same period ended 2022. The Company recognized Net Income of $1,156,507 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 as opposed to Net Income of $2,443,531 the difference primarily attributable to the recognition by the Company of Derivative Income of $3,340,683 during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2023 we had $121,307 in cash on hand and current liabilities of $5,308,003 such liabilities materially consisting of Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Convertible Notes Payable, Derivative Liability Recognized, Unearned Income and Accrued Expenses. We feel we will not be able to satisfy our cash requirements over the next twelve months and shall be required to seek additional financing.\nOn September 12, 2023 the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Equity Line Agreement) with Coventry Enterprises LLC ( Coventry) providing for an equity financing facility (the Equity Line). The Equity Line Agreement provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the Equity Line Agreement, Coventry is committed to purchase up to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the Common Stock), over the 36-month term of the Equity Line Agreement (the Total Commitment).\nUnder the terms of the Equity Line Agreement, Coventry will not be obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock unless and until certain conditions are met, including but not limited to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement) becoming effective which registers Coventrys resale of any Common Stock purchased by Coventry under the Equity Line.\nFrom time to time over the 36-month term of the Commitment Period ( as such term is defined in the Equity Line Agreement) the Company, in its sole discretion, may provide Coventry with a draw down notice (each, a Draw Down Notice), to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock (each, a Draw Down Amount Requested), subject to the limitations discussed below. The actual amount of proceeds the Company will receive pursuant to each Draw Down Notice (each, a Draw Down Amount) is to be determined by multiplying the Draw Down Amount Requested by the applicable purchase price. The purchase price of each share of Common Stock equals 80% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock during the ten business days prior to the Draw Down Notice date (the Pricing Period).\nThe maximum number of shares of Common Stock requested to be purchased pursuant to any single Draw Down Notice cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 200% of the Average Daily Traded Value ( as such term is defined in the Equity Line Agreement) during the ten business days immediately preceding the Drawdown Notice Date or (ii) $250,000. The Company is prohibited from delivering a Draw Down Notice if the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Draw Down Notice would cause the Company to issue and sell to Coventry or Coventry to acquire or purchase an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that would result in Coventry beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.\nAs of September 30, 2023 the Company was not party to any binding agreements which would commit Regen to any material capital expenditures. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs we are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1), we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Regen Biopharma, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regen Biopharma, Inc. (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nWe determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/S BF Borgers CPA PC\nBF Borgers CPA PC (PCAOB ID 5041)\nWe have served as the Company's

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company was organized April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada\nThe Company intends to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which we intend to license from other entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials.\nThe Company is currently engaged in actively identifying small molecules that inhibit or express NR2F6 leading to immune cell activation for oncology applications and immune cell suppression for autoimmune disease.\nThe Company is in the early stages of development of its proposed products and therapies. The Company will be required to obtain approval from the FDA in order to market any of The Companys products or therapies. No approval has been granted by the FDA for the marketing and sale of any of the Companys products and therapies and no assurance may be given that any of the Companys products or therapies will be granted such approval. The Companys current plans include the development of regenerative medical applications up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and/ or Phase II clinical trials after which the Company would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The Company can provide no assurance that the Company will be able to sell or license any product or that, if such product is sold or licensed, such sale or license will be on terms favorable to the Company.\nA. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING\nThe financial statements have been prepared using the basis of accounting generally accepted in the United States of America. Under this basis of accounting, revenues are recorded as earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The Company has adopted a September 30 year-end.\nB. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KCL Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Regen. Significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company analyzes the conversion feature of Convertible Notes for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and Hedging. ASC 815-15 requires that the conversion features are bifurcated and separately accounted for as an embedded derivative contained in the Companys convertible debt. The embedded derivative is carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Any unrealized change in fair value, as determined at each measurement period, is recorded as a component of the income statement and the associated carrying amount on the balance sheet is adjusted by the change. The Company values the embedded derivative using the Black-Scholes pricing model.\nThe Black Scholes pricing model used to determine the Derivative Liability on convertible notes issued by the Company in which an embedded derivative is recognized as of September 30, 2023 utilized the following inputs:\nSchedule of Derivative liability\nRisk Free Interest Rate 5.29 %\nExpected Term (2.78) - (3.21) Yrs\nExpected Volatility 920.38 %\nExpected Dividends\nH. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes, which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Companys liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Companys results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. As of June 30, 2023 the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.\nThe Company generated a deferred tax credit through net operating loss carry forward. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established.\nInterest and penalties on tax deficiencies recognized in accordance with ACS accounting standards are classified as income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740-10-50-19.\nI. BASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260, Earnings Per Share, which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. ASC 260 requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 260 effective from inception.\nBasic net loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\nJ. ADVERTISING\nCosts associated with advertising are charged to expense as incurred. Advertising expenses were $0 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2023.\nK. NOTES RECEIVABLE\nNotes receivable are stated at cost, less impairment, if any.\nL. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nSales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. These terms are typically met upon the prepayment or invoicing and shipment of products.\nThe Company determines the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on its contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees. The Company recognizes royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when the Company considers realization of payment to be probable. Where royalties are based on a percentage of licensee sales of royalty-bearing products, the Company recognizes royalty revenue by applying this percentage to the Companys estimate of applicable licensee sales. The Company bases this estimate on an analysis of each licensees sales results. Where warranted, revenue from licensees for contractual obligations such as License Initiation Fees are recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions required to be satisfied in order for that revenue to have been earned by the Company.\nM. INTEREST RECEIVABLE\nInterest receivable is stated at cost, less impairment, if any.\nNOTE 2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, which eliminated certain financial reporting requirements of companies previously identified as Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this ASU simplify accounting guidance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The amendments also reduce data maintenance and, for those entities subject to audit, audit costs by eliminating the requirement for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entitys financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915. The Company has adopted this standard.\nAs of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 the Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The guidance in this Update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.\nThe core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nIn June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. A performance target in a share-based payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be accounted for as a performance condition under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. As a result, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the awards grant date fair value. Compensation cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has reviewed the applicable ASU and has not, at the current time, quantified the effects of this pronouncement, however it believes that there will be no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15 Preparation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entitys liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entitys liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements-Liquidation Basis of Accounting. Even when an entitys liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met the conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure.\nOn January 31, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-01, entitled Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The guidance in ASU 2013-01 amends the requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 210, entitled Balance Sheet. The ASU 2013-01 amendments to FASB ASC 210 clarify that ordinary trade receivables and receivables in general are not within the scope of ASU 2011-11, entitled Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, where that ASU amended the guidance in FASB ASC 210. As those disclosures now are modified with the ASU 2013-01 amendments, the FASB ASC 210 balance sheet offsetting disclosures now clearly are applicable only where reporting entities are involved with bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions that either are offset using the FASB ASC 210 or 815 requirements, or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. ASU 2013-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOn February 28, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-04, entitled Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for Which the Total Amount of the Obligation Is Fixed at the Reporting Date. The ASU 2013-04 amendments add to the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 405, entitled Liabilities and require reporting entities to measure obligations resulting from certain joint and several liability arrangements where the total amount of the obligation is fixed as of the reporting date, as the sum of the following:\nThe amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among co-obligors.\nAny additional amounts the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.\nWhile early adoption of the amended guidance is permitted, for public companies, the guidance is required to be implemented in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments need to be implemented retrospectively to all prior periods presented for obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of the year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2013-04 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys operating results or financial position.\nOn April 22, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update [ASU] 2013-07, entitled Liquidation Basis of Accounting. With ASU 2013-07, the FASB amends the guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification [FASB ASC] Topic 205, entitled Presentation of Financial Statements. The amendments serve to clarify when and how reporting entities should apply the liquidation basis of accounting. The guidance is applicable to all reporting entities, whether they are public or private companies or not-for-profit entities. The guidance also provides principles for the recognition of assets and liabilities and disclosures, as well as related financial statement presentation requirements. The requirements in ASU 2013-07 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods. Reporting entities are required to apply the requirements in ASU 2013-07 prospectively from the day that liquidation becomes imminent. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2013-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys operating results or financial position.\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 as of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity; Own Equity (ASU 2020-06\"), as part of its overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Companys current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company has adopted ASU 2020-06 as of the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 2022.\nA variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, the Companys management has not determined whether implementation of such standards would be material to its financial statements.\nNOTE 3. GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company generated net losses of $19,748,863 during the period from April 24, 2012 (inception) through September 30, 2023. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOn September 12, 2023 the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Equity Line Agreement) with Coventry Enterprises LLC ( Coventry) providing for an equity financing facility (the Equity Line). The Equity Line Agreement provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the Equity Line Agreement, Coventry is committed to purchase up to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the Common Stock), over the 36-month term of the Equity Line Agreement (the Total Commitment).\nUnder the terms of the Equity Line Agreement, Coventry will not be obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock unless and until certain conditions are met, including but not limited to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement) becoming effective which registers Coventrys resale of any Common Stock purchased by Coventry under the Equity Line.\nFrom time to time over the 36-month term of the Commitment Period ( as such term is defined in the Equity Line Agreement) the Company, in its sole discretion, may provide Coventry with a draw down notice (each, a Draw Down Notice), to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock (each, a Draw Down Amount Requested), subject to the limitations discussed below. The actual amount of proceeds the Company will receive pursuant to each Draw Down Notice (each, a Draw Down Amount) is to be determined by multiplying the Draw Down Amount Requested by the applicable purchase price. The purchase price of each share of Common Stock equals 80% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock during the ten business days prior to the Draw Down Notice date (the Pricing Period).\nThe maximum number of shares of Common Stock requested to be purchased pursuant to any single Draw Down Notice cannot exceed the lesser of (i) 200% of the Average Daily Traded Value ( as such term is defined in the Equity Line Agreement) during the ten business days immediately preceding the Drawdown Notice Date or (ii) $250,000. The Company is prohibited from delivering a Draw Down Notice if the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Draw Down Notice would cause the Company to issue and sell to Coventry or Coventry to acquire or purchase an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that would result in Coventry beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.\nThe Company issued Coventry 125,000 shares of its Common Stock in connection with the Equity Line Agreement.\nCoventry has agreed that:\n(a) for so long as the market price of the Companys common stock is above $1.25 per share and\n(b) the Company is in full compliance with all agreements entered into with Coventry and\n(c) and the Company has not issued any common shares at a per share price below $1.50, Coventry will agree to a leak out provision and will not sell more than 10,000 shares of the Commitment shares without permission from the Issuer.\nIn connection with the Equity Line Agreement the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated September 12, 2023 with Coventry (the Registration Rights Agreement), pursuant to which the Company agreed to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 shares issuable in accordance with the Equity Line Agreement as well as the aforementioned 125,000 common shares issued in connection with the Equity Line Agreement in a Registration Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Up to 1,126,954 Shares of Common Stock were registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.\nNOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE\n(a) RELATED PARTY\nSchedule of notes payable related party\nAs of September 30, 2023\nDavid Koos $ 710\nTotal: $ 710\n$710 lent to the Company by David Koos is due and payable at the demand of the holder and bears simple interest at a rate of 15% per annum.\n(b) NON RELATED PARTY As of September 30, 2023\nSchedule of notes payable non related party\nBostonia Partners, Inc. $ 95,000\nCoventry Enterprises LLC $ 175,000\nTotal: $ 270,000\n$45,000 lent to the Company by Bostonia Partners, Inc is due and payable on March 7, 2024 and bears simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\n$50,000 lent to the Company by Bostonia Partners, Inc is due and payable on March 10, 2024 and bears simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum.\nEffective September 12, 2023 Coventry Enterprises purchased a 10% unsecured promissory Note (the Note) from the Company in the principal amount of $175,000 of which $26,250 was retained by Coventry through an Original Issue Discount.\nThe Note carries Guaranteed Interest on the principal amount at the rate of 10% per annum for the eighteen-month term of the Note for an aggregate Guaranteed Interest $26,250. The Principal Amount and the Guaranteed Interest shall be due and payable in seven equal monthly payments of $28,750 commencing on August 12, 2024 and continuing on the 12th day of each month thereafter until paid in full not later than March 12, 2025 (the Maturity Date).\nUpon an Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Note) the Note shall become convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder at price per share equivalent to 90% of the lowest per-share trading price for the 20 Trading Days preceding a Conversion Date.\nUpon the event that while this Note has been outstanding for four months, the Company consummates another financing transaction or if the Company has an effective Regulation A Offering Statement then the Investor may choose to convert any amount up to the entire balance of the note including guaranteed interest into shares at the same offering price as the aforementioned financing transaction or the Regulation A Offering..\nNOTE 5.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, RELATED PARTY\nOn June 11, 2018 Regen Biopharma, Inc. was paid a property dividend consisting of 470,588 of the common shares of Zander Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn November 29, 2018 the Company accepted 725,000 shares of the Series M Preferred stock of Zander Therapeutics, Inc. in satisfaction of prepaid rent and accrued interest owed to the Company collectively amounting to $13,124.\nOn June 30, 2023 the Company revalued 470,588 of the common shares of Zander Therapeutics, Inc. and 725,000 shares of the Series M Preferred stock of Zander Therapeutics, Inc. based on the following inputs:\nSchedule of investment securities related party\nFair Value of Intellectual Property $ 1,500\nPrepaid Expenses 65,661\nDue from Employee 1,071\nNote Receivable 64,400\nAccrued Interest Receivable 23,989\nInvestment Securities 8,423,366\nConvertible Note Receivable 10,000\nAccounts Payable 1,269,041\nNotes Payable 400,000\nAccrued Expenses Related Parties 162,011\nNotes Payable Related Party\nAccrued Expenses 203,037\nEnterprise Value 10,563,930\nLess: Total Debt (2,038,343 )\nPortion of Enterprise Value Attributable to Shareholders 8,525,587\nFair Value Per Share $ 0.186168\nThe abovementioned constitute the Companys sole related party investment securities as of September 30, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2023:\nSchedule of comprehensive Income\n470,588 Common Shares of Zander Therapeutics, Inc.\nBasis\nFair Value\nTotal Unrealized\nGains\nNet Unrealized Gain or (Loss) realized during the quarter ended September 30, 2023\n$ 5,741\n$ 87,608\n$ 81,867\n$\n725,000 Series M Preferred of Zander Therapeutics, Inc.\nBasis\nFair Value\nTotal Unrealized Gain\nNet Unrealized Gain or (Loss) realized during the quarter ended September 30, 2023\n$ 13,124\n$ 134,971\n$ 121,847\n$\nNOTE 10. INCOME TAXES\nAs of September 30, 2023\nSchedule of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating tax carry forwards $ 4,147,261\nOther (0 )\nGross deferred tax assets 4,147,261\nValuation allowance (4,147,261 )\nNet deferred tax assets $ (0 )\nAs of September 30 2023 the Company has a Deferred Tax Asset of $4,147,261 completely attributable to net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $19,748,863. The amount and availability of any net operating loss carryforward will be subject to the limitations set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Such factors as the number of shares ultimately issued within a three-year look-back period; whether there is a deemed more than 50% change in control; the applicable long-term tax exempt bond rate; continuity of historical business; and subsequent income of the Company all enter into the annual computation of allowable annual utilization of any net operating loss carryforward.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. The achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain.\nA corporation is considered to undergo an ownership change if, as a result of changes in the stock ownership by 5-percent shareholders or as a result of certain reorganizations, the percentage of the corporations stock owned by those 5-percent shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the prior three-year testing period. Five-percent shareholders are persons who hold 5% or more of the stock of a corporation at any time during the testing period as well as certain groups of shareholders (based typically on whether they acquired their shares in a single offering or exchange transaction) who are not individually 5-percent shareholders.\nAs the Company will require cash infusions in order to implement its business plan, and as it is probable, although not guaranteed, that such funding needs may be met through the sale of equity securities to 5-percent shareholders, the Company recognized a valuation allowance equal to the deferred Tax Asset and the Company recorded a valuation allowance reducing all deferred tax assets to 0.\nNOTE 11.

Controls and Procedures\na) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023.

David Koos is the Companys CEO and functions as the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer respectively.\nb) Managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2023 the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report. This exemption for smaller reporting companies provided under the temporary rules referenced above has been made permanent under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n(c) There have been no changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

The Company is not a \"listed company\" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and is therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised of independent directors. The Company does not currently have an audit committee, however, for certain purposes of the rules and regulations of the SEC and in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Companys Board of Directors is deemed to be its audit committee and as such functions as an audit committee and performs some of the same functions as an audit committee including: (1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors. The Board of Directors has determined that its member is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial business experience that results in that member's financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that its member has the sufficient knowledge and experience necessary to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee would have.\nNominating and Compensation Committees\nThe Company does not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. The board of directors believes that it is not necessary to have a compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee are adequately performed by the board of directors. The board of directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for the Company not to have a standing nominating committee because the board of directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of a nominating committee. The Company is not a \"listed company\" under SEC rules and is therefore not required to have a compensation committee or a nominating committee.\nShareholder Communications\nThere has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. There are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the board of directors. Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board of directors followed by the boards review of the candidates resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, the board of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company does not pay any fee to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee.\nBecause the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors has determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication would be brought to the Board of Directors attention by virtue of the co-extensive capacities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nExecutive Compensation\nName and Principal Position Year Salary\n($) Bonus\n($) Option\nAwards\n($) Non Equity\nIncentive\nPlan\nCompensation\n($) Nonqualified Total\nDeferred\nCompensation\nEarnings\n($)\nDavid Koos\nChairman, and CEO From October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 $ 10,050 * 0\nName and Principal Position Year Salary\n($) Bonus\n($) Option\nAwards\n($) Non Equity\nIncentive\nPlan\nCompensation\n($) Nonqualified Total\nDeferred\nCompensation\nEarnings\n($)\nDavid Koos\nChairman, and CEO From October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022 $ 0 0\nThere is a balance of $457,111 of salary accrued but unpaid due to David Koos.\n*On March 17, 2023 David Koos was issued 15,000 Series NC Preferred shares in satisfaction of $10,050 of salaries accrued yet unpaid.\nEmployment Agreements\nCurrently neither the Company nor the Companys wholly owned subsidiary is party to any employment agreement.

The Company is not a \"listed company\" under SEC rules and is therefore not required to have a compensation committee or a nominating committee.\nShareholder Communications\nThere has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. There are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the board of directors. Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board of directors followed by the boards review of the candidates resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, the board of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company does not pay any fee to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee.\nThe Board of Directors has determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication would be brought to the board of directors attention by virtue of communication with management.\nThe following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to us by BF Borgers CPA PC for the period beginning October 1, 2021 and ending September 30, 2022:\nAudit Fees $ 21,600\nAudit Related Fees 16,300\nTax Fees\nAll Other Fees\n$ 37,900\nAudit Fees: Aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements.\nAudit Related Fees: Aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for assurance and related services that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees above.
