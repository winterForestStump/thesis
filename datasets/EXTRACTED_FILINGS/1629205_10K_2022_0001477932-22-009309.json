    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCorporate Overview\nEstablished in 2014, Innovation1 Biotech Inc. (OTCQB: IVBT) is headquartered in New York, NY. Innovation1 Biotech is a pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and clinical development of novel synthetic analogs of botanical Schedule 1 molecules addressing major unmet medical needs. We take already validated technologies and identify opportunities to refine and reengineer them, eliminating deficiencies and creating products with more desirable performance attributes. The candidate molecules in our portfolio have their genesis in natural product botanical chemistry but have been subsequently modified via synthetic chemistry to endow them with more favorable pharmaceutical characteristics.\nOn November 9, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition (the Acquisition) of all of the assets, including intellectual property assets, relating to Mioxal\u00ae, a nutraceutical complex composed of essential amino acids, natural coenzymes and minerals, held by ST Biosciences, Ltd., a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (STB). The Acquisition was completed pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 5, 2021 (the Asset Purchase Agreement) described in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on November 8, 2021 (the November 8th Current Report). As consideration for the Acquisition, the Company issued 19,831,623 shares of Common Stock to STB, which at the closing of the Acquisition represented approximately 70% of the Companys outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The closing of the Acquisition contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement on November 5, 2021, resulted in a change of control of the Company.\nThe Common Stock issued to STB was valued at approximately $40,495,000 or $2.05 per share.\nOn November 7, 2022, the Company completed the disposition of all of the intellectual property assets and associated liabilities relating to Mioxal\u00ae. See Subsequent Events.\nOur Pipeline\nAt Innovation1 Biotech, we are delivering innovative change in the psychedelic and cannabinoid space through the development of a portfolio that addresses five independent clinical indications with fully synthetic prodrugs, wherein the current therapeutic armamentarium is inadequate or non-existent.\nThe first agent is a novel prodrug of psilocin, a molecule naturally found in certain mushroom species that has been shown to interact with hydroxytryptamine receptors in the limbic system of the central nervous system. Preclinical and human data support its use as a long-effecting agent for reduction of clinical depression. Our prodrug allows for a smooth pharmacokinetic profile, and avoids peak toxicologic side-effects, by blunting the maximal peak concentration.\nThe second agent is a novel prodrug of synthetic tetrahydrocannobivarin, a molecule naturally found in Cannabis that modulates the two principal cannabinoid receptors: CBR1 and CBR2. Preclinical data support its use in the treatment of drug addiction. Our prodrug, which is manufactured chemically without any connection to the Cannabis plant, allows for improved bioavailability and hence more stable and reliable concentrations of the drug in the central nervous system.\nThe third agent is a novel prodrug of synthetic cannabidophorol, a molecule naturally found in Cannabis, closely related to cannabidiol (CBD), that desensitizes several membrane-bound receptors in the brain (TRPV1, TRPA1, GPR55) that impact neuronal excitability and seizures. The FDA has already approved Epidiolex (CBD) for treatment of a childhood seizure disorder (Dravet syndrome). Our prodrug, which is manufactured chemically without any connection to the Cannabis plant, is expected to have improved bioavailability in comparison to CBD and its payload, cannabidophorol, is anticipated to be more potent than CBD in suppressing seizures due to its greater affinity for its biological targets.\nThe fourth agent is a second novel prodrug of a highly selective CB2R agonist payload, synthetic HU-308, which is structurally similar to tetrahydrocannabinol but without its psychotropic properties. HU-308 prodrug is manufactured chemically, without any connection to the Cannabis plant. Preclinical data support the use of this payload in the treatment of wounds, based on its role in blocking inflammatory injury and in triggering stem cell proliferation and angiogenesis required for prompt wound closure. The Company intends to advance its HU-308 for the treatment of burn wound injury.\nThe fifth agent is a second water-soluble prodrug of HU-308, formulated as an eye drop for topical ophthalmic care. Preclinical data support the use of this payload in the treatment of uveal inflammation and corneal injury, based on its role in suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and via stimulation of growth factors necessitated for repair of damaged epithelium. The Companys prodrug allows for improved bioavailability and facile administration as an eye drop.\nResearch and Clinical Development Strategy\nWe are currently in the pre-clinical development stage for our five pharmaceutical candidates. Our goal is to become a leader in the development of modified Schedule 1 molecules of botanical origin where there is the opportunity to effect breakthrough advances in diseases of unmet medical need.\nIn order to achieve our goal, we plan to build an experienced team of senior executives and board members, along with a team of scientists accomplished in all facets of pharmaceutical research and development, drug formulation, clinical trial execution, and regulatory submissions. We intend to leverage the knowledge of our team in order to complete the clinical trials needed to receive approvals of our product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities.\nCapital Considerations\nOur business plan can be adjusted based on the available capital to the business.\n\u00b7\nOn September 7, 2021, the Company consummated the initial tranche of its $2 million financing contemplated by that certain Series B-1 Purchase Agreement between the Company and Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (LPC) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to LPC up to 2,694,514 shares of its newly designated Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B-1 Preferred) at a Stated Value per share price of $0.742245 (or $2,000,000 in the aggregate). At the initial closing, the Company issued 673,628 shares of Series B-1 Preferred to LPC and received $500,000 in gross proceeds. On October 28, 2021, the Company consummated the second tranche of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock investment, issuing an additional 637,628 shares of its Series B-1 Preferred Stock to LPC at a price per share of $0.742245 or $500,000.00 in the aggregate. On November 9, 2021, the Company consummated the third and final tranche of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock investment, issuing an additional 1,347,256 shares of its Series B-1 Preferred Stock to LPC at a price per share of $0.742245 or $1,000,000.00 in the aggregate. The aggregate gross proceeds of $2,000,000 will be used by the Company as working capital\n\u00b7\nOn November 24, 2021, the Company entered into and consummated the financing contemplated by that certain Series B-1 Purchase Agreement between the Company and L1 Capital Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. (L1 Capital), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to L1 Capital 2,694,514 shares of its Series B-1 Preferred at a per share price of $0.742245, or $2,000,000 in the aggregate. Pursuant to the terms of the respective purchase agreements with LPC and L1 Capital, each of LPC and L1 Capital agreed, for a period of 180 days following the final closing of such transaction, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, purchase any option or contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, or otherwise encumber, dispose of or transfer, or grant any rights with respect to, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series B-1 Preferred or any shares of the Companys common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred. In addition, each of LPC and L1 Capital, along with the holders of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock has been granted the right (until the earlier of (i) the sixteen (16) month anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the listing of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange) to participate in up to 10% of the Companys future equity or equity-linked financings. Furthermore, the Company granted these stockholders certain piggyback registration rights with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred and Series B Preferred issued to such stockholder.\n\u00b7\nSubsequent to the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a private placement to receive gross proceeds up to $352,941 original issue discount secured convertible promissory notes with attached $0.08 warrants to purchase up to 4,411,764 shares of common stock. Each note is discounted 15% with a maturity date of 18 months from original issuance. The notes bear interest of 8% per annum to be paid monthly. Each note is convertible into common shares by diving the outstanding principal on the note by the conversion price of $0.08.\n\u00b7\nWe believe cash on hand will not adequately fund our current planned operations and capital needs for the next 12 months. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, including seeking investments from strategic investors. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.\nThe above reflects our current judgment and belief regarding the direction of our business. Actual events, expenditures and results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections or assumptions suggested herein.\nProduct Marketing\nWe currently have no marketing agreement(s) with third party marketing groups.\nProduct Development\nInnovation1 Biotech has engaged with Salzman Group, a US-Israeli pharmaceutical firm that according to Salzman Group has designed and developed of novel small molecules for a number of clinical applications. According to Salzman Group, it has invented novel, proprietary, water-soluble, and fully synthetic prodrugs of the most promising botanical molecules existing today. It is the stated goal of Salzman Group to exploit the vast intrinsic therapeutic power of botanical Schedule 1 molecules. Innovation1 Biotech has acquired five proprietary preclinical prodrugs, all fully synthetic without connection to botanical sourcing: a psychedelic molecule for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, a novel cannabinoid and tree bark derived psychedelic for treatment of addiction, and three additional novel cannabinoid prodrugs addressing clinical indications of refractory pediatric epilepsy, hypertrophic scarring after burn wound injury, and ocular inflammation of the cornea and anterior uvea.\nSee Subsequent Events below concerning the resignation of Dr. Salzman and his related groups, Salzman Group and Herring Creek Pharmaceuticals.\nCompetition\nDirect Competitors:\nThe Company does not currently face direct competition for its portfolio technologies, but has a number of indirect competitors as listed below.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and intense competition. While we believe that our knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates for which we complete clinical development successfully and for which we receive marketing approval may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nMany of our competitors have far greater marketing and research capabilities than us. We also face potential competition from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, among others, which may in the future develop products to treat those diseases that we currently or, in the future, seek to treat. The current market for treatments that assist in novel therapeutics for major unmet medical needs, is highly unknown. Our commercial opportunity would be reduced significantly if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our product candidates.\nIndirect Competitors:\nPosttraumatic stress disorder is treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medications sertraline and paroxetine, both approved by the FDA for PTSD treatment. Antianxiety medications are commonly prescribed to relieve severe anxiety despite their potential for abuse. While several studies indicated that the antihypertensive medication prazosin (Minipress) may reduce or suppress nightmares in some people with PTSD, a more recent study showed no benefit over placebo.\nAddiction symptoms and signs of drug withdrawal and detox are currently managed with (1) anxiolytic agents that reduce anxiety and irritability, such as benzodiazepines, (2) antidepressants such as sertraline and fluoxetine, and (3) clonidine to reduce sweating, cramps, muscle aches, anxiety, tremors, and seizures. Alcohol addiction is treated with (1) naltrexone to block receptors in the brain that produce alcohols pleasurable effects, (2) acamprosate to relieve emotional and physical distress and depression, and (3) disulfiram to induce nausea and vomiting when alcohol is ingested. Heroin and opiate addiction are currently treated with methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.\nChildhood epilepsy, manifesting as partial or tonic-clonic seizures, is currently treated with carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid, as well as ACTH, clobazam, felbamate, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, tiagabine hydrochloride, topiramate, vigabatrin, and zonisamide. The medications Diastat rectal gel, Epidiolex (made from cannabidiol), and fenfluramine have been approved for treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy (Dravets syndrome).\nUveitis is treated with (1) corticosteroids, (2) immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, cyclosporin, methotrexate, and mycophenolate, and (3) targeted immunomodulating biologic agents, including Abatacept, Adalimumab, Daclizumab, Infliximab, and Rituximab.\nWound care is currently treated with topical antibiotics and disinfectants, and supportive surgical debridement and skin grafting.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company filed provisional patent applications protecting composition of matter and method of use of all the technologies described below. All of these applications are assigned to the Company. The Company will have the option to convert its provisional applications to full published patent applications in 2023. Within 30-31 months of the publication of the full patent applications, the Company will have the opportunity to file national phase applications in up to 154 countries.\nTitle *\nStatus\nPriority Date\nExpiry Date\nPsilocin prodrugs and uses thereof\nProvisional Patent Filed\nJanuary 2022\n21 years, plus 3-5-year extension\nTetrahydrocannabivarian (THCV) prodrugs and uses thereof\nProvisional Patent Filed\nAugust 2022\n21 years, plus 3-5-year extension\nCannabidiphoral (CBDP) prodrugs and uses thereof\nProvisional Patent Filed\nJanuary 2022\n21 years, plus 3-5-year extension\nHU-308 prodrugs and uses thereof\nProvisional Patent Filed\nJanuary 2022\n21 years, plus 3-5-year extension\nHU-308 prodrugs and uses thereof\nProvisional Patent Filed\nJanuary 2022\n21 years, plus 3-5-year extension\nCompositions Comprising an Anti-inflammatory Cannabinoid and Uses Thereof\nProvisional Patent Filed\nJune 2022\n21 years, plus 3-5-year extension\n* See the risk factor related to the Inflation Reduction Act in the Risk Factors section\nWe rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks.\nThe Company has the following approved trademark application with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO):\n\u00b7\nINNOVATION1 BIOTECH - U.S. Trademark SN 97195093\nWe are reliant on our domain name, www.innovation1bio.com, to market our products. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain name or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.\nSubsequent to August 31, 2022, we sold the Mioxal product intellectual property and intangible assets as described in Note 12 to the financial statements and in the Subsequent Events disclosed elsewhere in this document.\nGovernment Regulation\nInitially, we intend to obtain approvals for our pharmaceutical candidates from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, and other countries governmental regulatory agencies approvals for our product candidates.\nRegulation of Psilocin and Ibogaine analog\nIn the United States, psychedelics, such as psilocin and ibogaine, are listed by the DEA as a Schedule I substance under the CSA. The Company is developing a prodrug of psilocin and an analog of ibogaine, entitled 18-methylaminocoronaridine, which might be considered as a Schedule I substance under the Federal Analog Act. The DEA regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II substances are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II substances is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription and may have a black box warning. Further, most, if not all, state laws in the United States classify psilocin as a Schedule I controlled substance. For any product containing a prodrug of psilocin or an analog of ibogaine to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, these prodrugs and analogs must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. Commercial marketing in the United States will also require scheduling-related legislative or administrative action.\nHuman Capital\nTimothy S. Orr was the sole officer, director and employee of the Company during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. On November 9, 2021, the Company completed the asset acquisition of ST Biosciences, Ltd., consisting substantially all of intellectual property assets relating to Mioxal. The closing of the acquisition resulted in a change of control of the Company. As part of the acquisition, Mr. Orr stepped down as the Companys Chief Executive Officer and assumed the role of the Companys Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Orr has since resigned from his position and as a director.\nPursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Jeffrey J. Kraws was appointed as the Companys Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 and prior to the filing of this report, Mr. Kraws resigned as CEO, but remains a director of the Company. Also pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to appoint Jason Frankovich as a director of the Company subject to the Companys compliance with Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. Mr. Frankovich has since resigned from his position as a director. On April 1, 2022, the Board appointed Patrick R. Morris, Esq. as a member of the Board to fill that vacancy. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, Andrew L. Salzman M.D. was appointed as the Companys Chief Scientific Officer and a director of the Company. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 and prior to filing this report, Dr. Salzman resigned as a director and as the Companys CSO. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 and prior to the filing of this report, Frederick E. Pierce, II was appointed as Chairman of the Board and Interim Acting Chief Executive Officer. On December 5, 2022, Charles W. Allen and Dr. Shahin Gharakhanian were appointed directors. Provided we have the resources, we intend to expand our current management to attract and retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus.\nAdditional information\nInformation on the history of our company can be found in Note 1 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report. We file annual, quarterly and other reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers such as our company that file electronically with the SEC. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves several significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing our securities. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed because of the occurrence of any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe incurred net operating losses of $40,877,813 and $258,441, respectively, for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021. At August 31, 2022 we had an accumulated deficit of $44,551,043. We do not generate sufficient revenues to provide funds to pay our operating expenses, satisfy our obligations or continue to implement our business model. Unless we are able to raise sufficient working capital to continue to implement our business model, will have no ability to increase our revenues to a level which supports our operations. In that event, we will continue to report net losses in future periods and our ability to continue our operations as they are presently conducted will be in jeopardy.\nOur auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have sustained recurring losses from operations and have a net capital deficiency. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe have experienced recurring operating losses over the last two years and have a significant accumulated deficit. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and consume significant cash resources for the foreseeable future. Without additional financing, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, meaning that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment.\nWe have a working capital deficit at August 31, 2022 and 2021. We need to raise additional capital to continue our business model.\nAt August 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $156,486 and a working capital deficit of $29,525,460 compare to a cash balance of $137,476 and a working capital deficit of $238,249 at August 31, 2021. We used $3,127,852 in net cash in our operations in the year ended August 31, 2022 as compared to $30,405 in net cash used in our operations in the year ended August 31, 2021. The decrease in working capital from August 31, 2021 resulted from our acquisition of the Mioxal asset which is a long-term asset and the associated current Mioxal liability, an increase in our accounts payable, accrued expenses, dividends payable, and the current portion of our lease liability. Our principal sources of liquidity are sales of equity and debt securities. We intend to raise additional capital in the next 12 months in order to continue to implement our business model. We do not have any firm commitments to raise additional working capital. As we are a small company whose stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, we expect to encounter difficulty in raising working capital upon terms and conditions satisfactory to us, if at all. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining funding to continue operations. In that event, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe may have difficulties managing our anticipated growth, or we may not grow at all.\nIf we succeed in growing our business, such growth could strain our management team and capital resources. Our ability to manage operations and control growth will be dependent on our ability to raise and spend capital to successfully attract, train, motivate, retain, and manage new members of senior management and other key personnel and continue to update and improve our management and operational systems, infrastructure and other resources, financial and management controls, and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause us to misallocate management or financial resources, and result in additional expenditures and inefficient use of existing human and capital resources or we otherwise may be forced to grow at a slower pace that could impair or eliminate our ability to achieve and sustain profitability. Such slower than expected growth may require us to restrict or cease our operations and go out of business.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are not effective, which may cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.\nOur management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2022 and concluded that as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. In addition, our management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022 and concluded that that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of that date and that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have not yet remediated these material weaknesses and we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting continue to be ineffective. Until these issues are corrected, our ability to report financial results or other information required to be disclosed on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected and our financial reporting may continue to be unreliable, which could result in additional misinformation being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nOur management has previously determined that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts and plans, see Controls and Procedures. If the result of our remediation of the identified material weaknesses is not successful, or if additional material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nWe may receive, collect, store, process, transfer, and use personal information and other data relating to our customers, website visitors, employees, vendors and contractors employees, and other persons, and we rely in part on third parties that are not directly under our control to manage certain of these operations and to collect, store, process and use payment information. Due to the volume and sensitivity of the personal information and other data that we and these third parties manage and expect to manage in the future, as well as the nature of our customer base, the security features of our information systems are critical. A variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of this information. Laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, data protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Given the uncertainty and complexity of the regulatory framework for data privacy and security, data protection and consumer protection worldwide, there is the potential that these or other actual or alleged obligations may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, or may be interpreted and applied in such a way as to conflict with our other legal obligations or practices. In addition, we are also subject to certain contractual obligations to third parties related to data privacy and security and data protection. As a result, while we strive to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our applicable policies and contractual obligations, and all other applicable legal obligations relating to data privacy and security, data protection and consumer protection to the extent possible, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel.\nOur success depends in a large part on our key executives. The loss or absence of their services could have a material adverse effect on us. We will need to fill positions such as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Science Officer and possibly others. Our ability to execute the Companys strategic goals will depend in large part on the efforts of these individuals. We may face competition for qualified personnel, and we may not be able to attract and retain such personnel.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Business and Products\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical studies and depends upon numerous factors. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidates clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nApplications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nThe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidates safety-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nthe data collected from clinical studies of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates, which are in the pre-clinical stage of development. We cannot give any assurance that any of our product candidates will proceed to clinical development or that they will receive regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized.\nWe as a company have not submitted marketing applications to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical studies or receive regulatory approval or what regulatory pathway the regulatory authorities shall designate for our product candidates. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical studies. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nWe generally plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, the European Union, Japan, Australia and other foreign countries. To obtain regulatory approvals we must comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical studies, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval in one jurisdiction, we cannot ensure that we will obtain approval in any other jurisdictions. If we are unable to obtain approval for our product candidates in multiple jurisdictions, our revenue and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nThe Company previously sold products infused with CBD, and the negative publicity from previously being involved in the hemp and CBD space could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company was previously involved in the sale of a health water infused with CBD. However, the Company has since ceased the sale of this product and has fully transitioned into a pharmaceutical, small molecule, research and development company, involved in the development of fully synthetic prodrugs without connection to botanical sourcing. The Companys use of these synthetic prodrugs, which do not contain any botanical sourcing of cannabis, hemp or CBD, may still result in confusion given the Companys previous business selling health water infused with CBD. Any negative publicity resulting from an incorrect perception that we operate in the cannabis space could result in a loss of current or future business. It could also adversely affect the publics perception of us or our common stock and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with or invest in us. We cannot assure you that additional business partners, including but not limited to financial institutions and customers, will not attempt to end or curtail their relationships with us. Any such negative press or impacts to business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future study results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical study process. The results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical studies, if any are commenced, of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent advanced clinical studies. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed satisfactorily through preclinical studies and initial clinical studies. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. We do not know whether any Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 (if any) or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in our clinical studies, or we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\ninability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of human clinical studies;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical study sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical study site;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, after review of an IND, application, or equivalent application, or an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\n\u00b7\nfailure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical study requirements;\n\u00b7\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDAs Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, requirements, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u00b7\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\nclinical studies of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product candidate development programs; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. We may also be required to conduct additional safety, efficacy and comparability studies before we will be allowed to start clinical studies with our repurposed drugs. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our product candidates have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring product candidates to market before we do, which could impair our ability to obtain orphan exclusivity and successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nAny therapeutic candidates we may develop in the future may be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations in the territories where the product will be marketed, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations and our financial condition.\nIn the United States, psychedelics such as psilocin and ibogaine, are generally listed by the DEA as a Schedule I substance under the CSA. The Company is developing a prodrug of psilocin and an analog of ibogaine, entitled 18-methylaminocoronaridine, which might be considered as a Schedule I substance under the Federal Analog Act. The DEA regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II substances are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II substances is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription and may have a black box warning. Further, most, if not all, state laws in the United States classify psilocin as a Schedule I controlled substance. For any product containing psilocin to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, psilocin must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. Commercial marketing in the United States will also require scheduling-related legislative or administrative action.\nScheduling determinations by the DEA are dependent on FDA approval of a substance or a specific formulation of a substance. Therefore, while psilocin is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved by the FDA for medical use in the United States that contain psilocin should be placed in Schedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the accepted medical use requirement. If one of our product candidates receives FDA approval, we anticipate that the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place it in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. This scheduling determination will be dependent on FDA approval and the FDAs recommendation as to the appropriate schedule. During the review process, and prior to approval, the FDA may determine that it requires additional data, either from non-clinical or clinical studies, including with respect to whether, or to what extent, the substance has abuse potential. This may introduce a delay into the approval and any potential rescheduling process. That delay would be dependent on the quantity of additional data required by the FDA. This scheduling determination will require DEA to conduct notice and comment rule making including issuing an interim final rule. Such action will be subject to public comment and requests for hearing which could affect the scheduling of these substances. There can be no assurance that the DEA will make a favorable scheduling decision. Even assuming categorization as a Schedule II or lower controlled substance (i.e., Schedule III, IV or V), at the federal level, such substances would also require scheduling determinations under state laws and regulations.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation.\nAs our product portfolio evolves, the regulatory environment with regard to our business is also evolving. Government officials often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable laws or regulations. We may in the future receive formal and informal inquiries from various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as self-regulatory organizations or consumer protection watchdog groups, about our business and compliance with local laws, regulations, or standards. Any determination that our products, operations or activities, or the activities of our employees, contractors or agents, are not in compliance with existing laws, regulations or standards, could adversely affect our business in a number of ways. Even if such an inquiry does not result in the imposition of fines, interruptions to our business, loss of suppliers or other third-party relationships, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, or similar direct results, the existence of the inquiry alone could potentially create negative publicity that could harm our business and/or reputation.\nRisks Related to the Inflation Reduction Act\nThe recently-passed Inflation Reduction Act may impact, either positively or negatively, our future strategies and results of operations as it pertains to our planned product offerings.\nPassed by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is landmark legislation which may significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The health care provisions contain significant changes to prescription drug pricing that could have far-reaching, rippling effects on the health care industry and its stakeholders. The Company has not had adequate time to fully evaluate this complex legislation. In recent months, publicly available information published on the internet by many reliable sources can be obtained for credible information, The Company cannot at this time determine the potential effects this legislation may have on its future operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nThere is currently a limited public market for our common stock, a trading market for our common stock may never develop, and our common stock prices may be volatile and could decline substantially.\nOur shares are currently traded on the over-the-counter market, with quotations entered for our common stock on the OTCQB under the symbol IVBT. However, the volume of trading in our common stock is currently limited. In these marketplaces, our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of their shares of our common stock and may find few buyers to purchase their stock and few market makers to support its price. As a result of these and other factors, investors may be unable to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price for which they purchased them, at or near quoted bid prices, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional equity in the future and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using shares of our common stock as consideration. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our common stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing, and remains listed on the OTC Markets or is suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nTherefore, an active, liquid, and orderly trading market for our common stock may not initially develop or be sustained, which could significantly depress the public price of our common stock and/or result in significant volatility, which could affect your ability to sell your common stock. Even if an active trading market develops for our common stock, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Our financial performance, government regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates and market conditions in general could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock.\nBecause our common stock is a penny stock, stockholders may be further limited in their ability to sell their shares.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 3a51-1, which establishes the definition of a penny stock as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our shares constitute a penny stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and are expected to remain classified as a penny stock for the foreseeable future. Classification as a penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares will be subject to Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. Rather than having to comply with these rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell a penny stock.\nWe are not subject to the rules of a national securities exchange requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures and, as a result, our stockholders do not have the same protections.\nWe are quoted on the OTCQB marketplace and are not subject to the rules of a national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. National securities exchanges generally require more rigorous measures relating to corporate governance designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management. The requirements of the OTCQB afford our stockholders fewer corporate governance protections than those of a national securities exchange. Until we comply with such greater corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, our stockholders will have fewer protections such as those related to director independence, stockholder approval rights and governance measures designed to provide board oversight of management.\nBecause we are a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible for exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nReduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements\u037e\n\u00b7\nNot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\u037e and\n\u00b7\nReduced disclosure obligations for our annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and registration statements.\nWe will remain a smaller reporting company until the end of the fiscal year in which (1) we have a public common equity float of more than $250 million, or (2) we have annual revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year of more than $100 million plus we have any public common equity float or public float of more than $700 million. We also would not be eligible for status as smaller reporting company if we become an investment company, an asset-backed issuer or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends to the holders of the common stock in the foreseeable future and the availability and timing of future cash dividends, if any, is uncertain.\nWe expect to use cash flow from future operations to repay debt and support the growth of our business and do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Subject to such restrictions, our board of directors will determine the amount and timing of stockholder dividends, if any, that we may pay in future periods. In making this determination, our directors will consider all relevant factors, including the amount of cash available for dividends, capital expenditures, covenants, prohibitions or limitations with respect to dividends, applicable law, general operational requirements and other variables. We cannot predict the amount or timing of any future dividends you may receive, and if we do commence the payment of dividends, we may be unable to pay, maintain or increase dividends over time. Therefore, you may not be able to realize any return on your investment in our common stock for an extended period of time, if at all.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress our share price, and any additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities. We are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations, preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors. The potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of the holders of our common stock and may create downward pressure on the trading price, if any, of our common stock. The registration rights of certain stockholders and the sales of substantial amounts of our common stock following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part or other effective registration statements of the Company, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital. These shares also may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates.\nWe may grant additional registration rights in connection with any future issuance of our capital stock.\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to issue 2,694,514 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred) in exchange for (i) 8,480,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) outstanding common stock purchase warrants, and (iii) all principal and accrued interest due under outstanding convertible promissory notes.\nOn September 7, 2021, the Company consummated the initial tranche of its $2 million financing contemplated by that certain Series B-1 Purchase Agreement between the Company and Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (LPC) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to LPC up to 2,694,514 shares of its newly designated Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B-1 Preferred) at a Stated Value per share price of $0.742245 (or $2,000,000 in the aggregate). On October 28, 2021, the Company consummated the second tranche of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock investment, issuing an additional 637,628 shares of its Series B-1 Preferred Stock to LPC at a price per share of $0.742245 or $500,000.00 in the aggregate. On November 9, 2021, the Company consummated the third and final tranche of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock investment, issuing an additional 1,347,256 shares of its Series B-1 Preferred Stock to LPC at a price per share of $0.742245 or $1,000,000.00 in the aggregate. On November 24, 2021, the Company entered into, and consummated the financing contemplated by, that certain Series B-1 Purchase Agreement between the Company and L1 Capital Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. (L1 Capital), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to L1 Capital 2,694,514 shares of its Series B-1 Preferred at a per share price of $0.742245, or $2,000,000 in the aggregate.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might grant to holders of preferred stock could affect the value of the common stock.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer a smaller reporting company. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs in staying current with reporting requirements. Our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives. Additionally, the lack of an internal audit group may result in material misstatements to our financial statements and ability to provide accurate financial information to our shareholders.\nOur management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives to maintain reporting status. Moreover, these rules and regulations, which are necessary to remain as a public reporting company, will be costly because external third-party consultant(s), attorneys, or other firms may have to assist us in following the applicable rules and regulations for each filing on behalf of the Company.\nWe currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may eventually need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to have effective internal controls for financial reporting.\nMoreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements or regulations as a public reporting company in any regard, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur current business address is 40 Wall Street Suite 2701, New York, NY 10005. We rent these facilities on a month-to-month basis for a monthly rental of approximately $20,000. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company could become a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcomes to the Company and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, the Companys estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. With the exception of the following, as of the date of this report, there are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of their property is the subject, nor are there any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities.\nOn September 30, 2022, a party identified as New You Inc. filed a complaint with the District Court of Clark County, Nevada against Innovation 1 Biotech, Inc, ST Biosciences LTD, Jeffrey Kraws and Jason Frankovich. The complaint alleges that during Mr. Frankovichs service to New You Inc. as Chairman of the Board of Directors, concurrent with Mr. Frankovichs and Mr. Krawss services as executives of ST Biosciences LTD, Mr. Frankovich converted funds away from New You Inc. to satisfy obligations of ST Biosciences LTD and/or Innovation1 and/or to enrich Frankovich and Kraws. The amount of the claim is a total of $249,020 plus damages in excess of $30,000 and includes a claim for legal fees. The Companys legal firm has evaluated the claims of the complaint and together with Innovation1 management believes the claims to be without merit. The Company intends to defend against the complaint and believes any potential liability to be $0. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNone.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the stock symbol IVBT. On August 31, 2022, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the OTCQB was $0.154 per share. As of August 31, 2022, there were 131 holders of record of our common stock.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn December 22, 2020, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, which were effective on January 8, 2021 (the Effective Date), which effected a three hundred eight for one (308:1) reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock.\nDividends\nThe payment of dividends, if any, in the future, rests within the sole discretion of our board of directors. The payment of dividends will depend upon our earnings, our capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. We have not declared any cash dividends since our inception and have no present intention of paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nTransfer Agent\nOur transfer agent is Empire Stock Transfer, Inc. (Empire Stock Transfer), whose address 1859 Whitney Mesa Dr., Henderson, Nevada 89014. Empire Stock Transfers telephone number is (702) 818-5898.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nNot Applicable ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements because of several factors, including those set forth under the Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Business sections in this Annual Report. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nEffective March 31, 2022, as approved by the shareholders, the name of the Company was changed from Gridiron BioNutrients, Inc. (trading symbol GVMP) to Innovation1 Biotech Inc. (trading symbol IVBT).\nInnovation1 Biotech Inc. (IVBT) believes it will be among the first companies to harness the raw power of botanical therapeutics by transforming them into fully synthetic drugs that are safely, reliably and consistently delivered. There are two fundamental limitations in exploiting botanical Schedule 1 molecules:\n1.\nLarge and unpredictable pharmacokinetic excursions, both high and low, that make the drug potentially dangerous or ineffective\n2.\nInsolubility in water that curtails bioavailability across mucosal membranes\nTo address these limitations, ST Biosciences, Ltd. engaged with Salzman Group, and Innovation1 later assumed the contractual obligations subsequent to the Asset Purchase Agreement completed on November 9, 2021 in order to gain access to a broader portfolio of intellectual property. According to Dr. Andrew Salzman, the Salzman Group, has pioneered the design and development of novel small molecules in the fields of cancer, heart disease, lung injury, intermediary metabolism and ophthalmology. The firm is currently regarded as a world leader in the design and optimization of rare cannabinoids.\nIVBT has acquired five proprietary preclinical prodrugs, all fully synthetic without connection to botanical sourcing: a mushroom-derived psychedelic molecule for treatment post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, a novel cannabinoid and tree bark derived psychedelic for treatment of addiction and three additional novel cannabinoid prodrugs addressing clinical indications of refractory pediatric epilepsy, hypertrophic scarring from burn wound injury and ocular inflammation of the cornea and anterior uvea. IVBTs drug portfolio uniquely positions IVBT to capitalize on the growing global demand for pharmaceutical Schedule 1 drugs.\nGoing Concern and Cash Flows\nOur financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had no revenue and a net operating loss of $40,877,813 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. The Company has working capital deficit of $29,525,460 and an accumulated deficit of $44,551,043 as of August 31, 2022. We do not have sufficient funds to support our daily operations for the next twelve (12) months. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe ability of the Company to fully commence its operations is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations and execution of its business plan. In response to these concerns, management plans to fund operations through additional debt and equity financing. Debt instruments may be convertible or non-convertible and will vary based on the Companys needs and financing options available at such times. There can be no assurance that managements plan will be successful.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business model and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.\nCOVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Subsequently, the COVID-19 spread globally including across North America and the United States. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. While the threat of continued or resurgent lockdowns or containment efforts have abated, we caution that our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to additional outbreaks of COVID-19.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPlease refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nOverview. We had revenues of $0 and $3,080 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We incurred a net income (loss) of ($40,690,155) and $1,039,932 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net income is attributable to the factors discussed below.\nRevenues. We had revenues from operations of $0 and $3,080 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our revenues for the year ended August 31, 2021 consisted primarily of our retail line of health water infused with probiotics and minerals and the sale of one liter of T-free distillate. The extent to which, and the amount of revenues which may be generated from our future business operations and activities is unknown.\nGross Margin. Once cost of revenue and other expenses to generate revenue are considered, we had gross margins of $0 and $1,659 from our operations for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nExpenses. Our operating expenses were $40,877,813 and $260,100 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to increased impairment expense of $35,780,148 of the Mioxal intangible assets, as well as increases of $4,237 in advertising, $324,658 in consulting fees, $125,518 in general and administrative expenses, $359,978 in professional fees, $201,165 in research and development, $1,259,519 in salaries, and $2,546,362 in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nOther (Income) Expense. Our total other (income) expense was ($152,080) and ($1,298,373) for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in other expenses was attributable to a decrease of $99,910 in interest expense, a decrease of $41,929 in interest income, a decrease $1,454,480 in gain on change in fair value of a derivative liability, a decrease of $8,349 in other income, and an increase of $143,956 in gain on extinguishment of debt.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended August 31, 2022, we used net cash of $3,127,852 for operating activities, primarily attributable to our aforementioned operating expenses. We used $853,138 in investing activities primarily attributable to our purchase the Mioxal asset. For the year ended August 31, 2022, we were provided $4,000,000 from financing activities for proceeds from our series B-1 preferred stock purchase agreements. We will require additional working capital to continue.\nAssets\nWe had total assets of $43,963,413 as of August 31, 2022, which consisted of $156,486 cash, other receivable of $56,421, prepaid expenses of $74,049, equipment of $2,615 (net of accumulated depreciation), trademarks of $1,680, intangibles of $42,980,076, ROU asset of $482,086 and security deposits of $210,000 ($150,000 paid to Herring Creek Pharmaceuticals and $60,000 as part of a lease agreement).\nLiabilities\nWe had total liabilities of $41,110,839 as of August 31, 2022 consisting of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $265,415, lease liability of $497,626, note payable of $10,000, dividends payable of $837,798, and the Mioxal liability of $39,500,000.\nCash Requirements\nAt August 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of $156,486. Such cash amount of $156,486 is not sufficient to continue our 12-month plan of operation. We will need to raise capital to realize our 12-month plan of operation and fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or from entering into notes payable. If we are successful in completing equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing.\nSubsequent Events\nDeparture of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors\nOn September 9, 2022, the Board of Directors of Innovation1 Biotech Inc. appointed Frederick E.

Each note is discounted 15% with a maturity date of 18 months from original issuance. The notes bear interest of 8% per annum to be paid monthly. Each note is convertible into common shares by dividing the outstanding principal on the note by the conversion price of $0.08. The warrants are exercisable for a period of seven years at an exercise price of $0.08 per share.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nNot Applicable. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot Applicable ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nINNOVATION1 BIOTECH INC.\nFinancial Statements\nAugust 31, 2022\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 (audited)\nStatements of Operations for the Years Ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 (audited)\nStatements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 (audited)\nStatements of Cash Flows for the Year Ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 (audited)\nNotes to Financial Statements\n30-42\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Innovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Innovation1 Biotech, Inc. (the Company) as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, statements of stockholders equity (deficit), and statements of cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has a net operating loss, working capital deficit, and an accumulated deficit as of yearend. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company acquired and held significant intangible assets for which potential impairment of the assets was required to be considered by the Company. Given the lack of activity surrounding these intangible assets, the material nature of the related accounts, and the degree of judgment and subjectivity in evaluating managements estimates and assumptions included in its impairment analysis, we assessed valuation and allocation of the impairment of intangible assets as a critical audit matter.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to evaluating the Companys impairment of intangible assets included the following, among others:\n\u00b7\nObtaining the Companys impairment analysis and reviewing for any clerical or computational errors.\n\u00b7\nIdentifying the primary inputs and assumptions utilized by the Company in its analysis and comparing to supporting documentation included in third-party specialists report and executed agreements in which the assets were disposed.\n\u00b7\nPerforming inquiries with the preparer of the specialists report and gaining an understanding of the process and considerations underlying their report, as well as the applicability of the report to the intangible assets held by the Company.\nFruci & Associates II, PLLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.\nOur PCAOB ID is #5525.\nSpokane, Washington\nDecember 14, 2022\nInnovation1 Biotech Inc.\nBalance Sheets\nAugust 31, 2022\nAugust 31, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent

Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nInnovation1 Biotech Inc. (the Company) was formed under the laws of the state of Nevada in 2014, under the name of My Cloudz, Inc. Gardiron BioNutriens completed a reverse merger with My Cloudz Inc, in October 2017 and the Company then changed its name to Gridiron BioNutrients, Inc. Effective March 31, 2022, as approved by the shareholders, the name of the Company was changed from Gridiron BioNutrients, Inc. (trading symbol GVMP) to Innovation1 Biotech Inc. (trading symbol IVBT).\nThe Company is currently developing products using five proprietary preclinical prodrugs, all fully synthetic without connection to botanical sourcing: a mushroom-derived psychedelic molecule for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, a novel cannabinoid and tree bark derived psychedelic for treatment of addiction and three additional novel cannabinoid prodrugs addressing clinical indications of refractory pediatric epilepsy, hypertrophic scarring and ocular inflammation.\nThe Company has elected an August 31st year end.\nOn December 22, 2020, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, as amended, which were effective on January 8, 2021 (the Effective Date), which effected a three hundred eight for one (308:1) reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock.\nChange in Control\nOn November 9, 2021, the Company completed the asset acquisition of ST Biosciences, Ltd., consisting substantially of intellectual property assets, relating to Mioxal\u00ae as discussed in Note 3 - Asset Acquisition. The closing of the acquisition resulted in a change of control of the Company. As part of the acquisition, Mr. Orr stepped down as the Companys Chief Executive Officer and assumed the role of the Companys Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Orr has since resigned from his position and as a director. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Jeffrey J. Kraws was appointed as the Companys Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. In addition, the Company agreed to appoint Jason Frankovich as a director of the Company subject to the Companys compliance with Rule 14F-1 of the Exchange Act. See Note 12 Subsequent Events.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had no revenue and a net operating loss of $40,877,813 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. The Company has working capital deficit of $29,525,460 and an accumulated deficit of $44,551,043 as of August 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months after the issuance of this financial statement. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe ability of the Company to fully commence its operations is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations and execution of its business plan. In response to these concerns, management plans to fund operations through additional debt and equity financing. Debt instruments may be convertible or non-convertible and will vary based on the Companys needs and financing options available at such times. There can be no assurance that managements plan will be successful.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThis summary of accounting policies for Innovation1 is presented to assist in understanding the Companys financial statements. The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP accounting) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts may have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current-year financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for fair value calculations, including those related to embedded conversion features of outstanding convertible notes payable.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Companys performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value of certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate cost because of their short maturities. The Company measures and reports fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value investments.\nFair value, as defined in ASC 820, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect its highest and best use by market participants, principal (or most advantageous) markets, and an in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, the Companys credit risk.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nValuation techniques are generally classified into three categories: the market approach; the income approach; and the cost approach. The selection and application of one or more of the techniques may require significant judgment and are primarily dependent upon the characteristics of the asset or liability, and the quality and availability of inputs. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820 also provides fair value hierarchy for inputs and resulting measurement as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant to the fair values.\nFair value measurements are required to be disclosed by the Level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall. Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (in Level 3 measurements) are subject to expanded disclosure requirements including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately presenting changes during the period attributable to the following: (i) total gains or losses for the period (realized and unrealized), segregating those gains or losses included in earnings, and a description of where those gains or losses included in earning are reported in the statement of income.\nThe Company did not have any Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities at August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021.\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements represent the results of Innovation1 Biotech Inc., its prior wholly owned subsidiary, Gridiron Ventures - dissolved in April 2022, and the assets, processes, and results therefrom. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. All financial information has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nInventories\nInventories consist of raw materials and T-free distillate and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of its inventory and reduces the carrying value of the inventory when items are determined to be obsolete, defective or in excess of forecasted sales requirements. Inventory write-downs for excess, defective and obsolete inventory are recorded as impairment expense in the accompanying statement of operations. The Company wrote-off $17,000 and $19,450 of obsolete inventory or inventory below market value for the for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nA summary of the Companys inventory as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nType\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nRaw Materials\n$ -\n$ -\nT-free Distillate\n-\n17,000\nTotal Inventory\n$ -\n$ 17,000\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed in the period incurred. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.\nDepreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets and the modified accelerated cost recovery system for federal income tax purposes. The estimated useful lives of depreciable computers and other equipment are three years.\nWith the asset acquisition as discussed in Note 3 - Asset Acquisition the Company wrote off the remaining property and equipment as impaired in the accompanying statement of operations. Depreciation expense was $523 and $1,414 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company accounts for intangible assets as prescribed in ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, Including its evaluation for impairment on a periodic basis. The acquisition of the Mioxal intangible assets from ST Biosciences as described in Note 3 Acquisition were recorded at the acquisition cost, with the assumed debt recorded at its face value. The Company performed an evaluation of impairment at August 31, 2022, and recorded an impairment expense commensurate with the net present value of expected future cash flows, as informed by the sale of the Mioxal intangible assets and debt at November 7, 2022.\nBasic Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Companys net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.\nThe Series B and Series B1 Convertible Preferred shares would convert to 8,083,542 shares of the Companys common stock in addition to the 20,020,239 outstanding shares at August 31, 2022. The Series B Convertible Preferred shares would convert to 2,694,514 shares of the Companys common stock in addition to the 188,616 outstanding shares at August 31, 2021. The Company calculates diluted earnings per share by dividing the Companys net income available to common shareholders less preferred dividends by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The conversion of the Companys Series B Convertible Preferred shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive due to the Companys operating losses for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow or market risks. However, certain other financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded conversion features on convertible debt, are classified as derivative liabilities due to protection provisions within the agreements. Convertible notes payable are initially recorded at fair value using the Monte Carlo model and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period. The preferred stock warrants are initially recorded at fair value using the Black Scholes model and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period. The Company accounts for derivative instruments and debt instruments in accordance with the interpretive guidance of ASC 815, ASU 2017-11, and associated pronouncements related to the classification and measurement of warrants and instruments with conversion features.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Use of net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes may be limited by Internal Revenue Code section 382 if a change of ownership occurs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 718. The Company issues restricted stock to employees and consultants for their services. Cost for these transactions is measured at the fair value of the equity instruments issued at the date of grant. These shares are considered fully vested and the fair market value is recognized as expense in the period granted. The Company recognized consulting expenses and a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital related to stock issued for services. For agreements requiring future services, the consulting expense is to be recognized ratably over the requisite service period.\nThere was no stock-based compensation during years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include (a) affiliates of the Company; (b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d) principal owners of the Company; (e) management of the Company; (f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b) description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity, and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract in entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year at September 1, 2021. Implementation of this ASU had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nAs of August 31, 2022, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nOther Receivable\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company discovered duplicate withdrawals from its payroll processing company and has recorded a receivable on its condensed consolidated balance sheet at August 31, 2022. There were $56,421 and $0 outstanding other receivable as of August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively.\nTrademark\nTrademark costs are capitalized as incurred to the extent the Company expects the costs incurred to result in a trademark being awarded. The trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite life and are reviewed for impairment loss considerations annually. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had trademarks totaling $1,680.\nLeases\nOperating lease right of use (ROU) assets represent the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nNOTE 3 - ASSET ACQUISITION\nOn October 27, 2021, the Company entered into an asset acquisition agreement with ST Biosciences, Ltd., a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (STB), of certain Transferred Assets, consisting substantially of their intellectual property relating to Mioxal\u00ae, a nutraceutical complex composed of essential amino acids, natural coenzymes and minerals. The Company acquired certain intellectual property and patent rights, and no tangible assets, assumed certain liabilities related to the acquisition of Mioxal by STB, as discussed below, and some outstanding employee payments. The acquisition was completed pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 9, 2021. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid $350,000 in cash to Ingenius, paid cash of $500,000 to STB and issued 19,831,623 shares of Common Stock to STB valued at $40,654,827 or $2.05 per share based on the closing market price on November 5, 2021, which at the closing of the acquisition represented approximately 70% of the Companys outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis, for an aggregate purchase price of $41,504,827, resulting in a change in control of the Company. The shares were issued in December 2021.\nAt acquisition the assets and liabilities assumed were recorded at the fair values as follows:\nMioxal\u00ae\n$ 81,249,827\nOther intangible assets\n178,000\nLess liabilities assumed:\nMioxal\u00ae liability assumed\n(39,500,000 )\nOther liabilities assumed\n(423,000 )\nNet value acquired in asset acquisition\n$ 41,504,827\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, additional intangibles of $28,773 were added related to the asset acquisition for payments made subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe Mioxal\u00ae intellectual property, including the patent rights, was acquired by STB from Ingenius Biotech S.L, a Spanish corporation (Ingenius) on September 10, 2021. The Ingenius milestone and stock payments set forth in the Purchase Agreement between Ingenius and STB, were assumed by the Company in aggregate of $39,500,000 and are recorded in current and long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The first installment of $1,500,000 was due on January 15, 2022, the second installment of $1,500,000 on April 15, 2022 and a $3,500,000 payment was due within thirty business days following the occurrence of the milestone event. The milestone, a signed sales agreement with a third party to distribute Mioxal throughout Europe, was not reached and therefore the requirement for the milestone payment was forfeited and will never be owed. In addition, $15,000,000 will be paid through the issuance of the Companys common stock in three tranches beginning twelve months from execution of agreement with STB on September 10, 2021, as follows:\nOn September 10, 2022 - $4,000,000, not issued as of the date of this filing\nOn September 10, 2023 - $5,000,000\nOn September 10, 2024 - $6,000,000\nTotal stock to be issued - $15,000,000\nThe remaining balance is to be paid on an earn-out basis whereunder Ingenius will earn an 8% royalty on all sales generated by Mioxal\u00ae until the balance is satisfied.\nOn January 13, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to Purchase Agreement with Ingenius Biotech S.L. to modify the terms of the agreement dated September 10, 2021. Under the amended agreement, the first installment of $1,500,000 is now due on June 30, 2022, with an additional extension of the due date to August 30, 2022 (not paid), and the second installment is now due on December 31, 2022.\nThe Mioxal\u00ae asset has a 24-year life and will be tested for impairment on an annual basis. During the three and twelve months ended August 31, 2022, amortization of $846,494 and $2,539,483 was expensed. The other intangible assets for $178,000 have a 21-year life. During the three and twelve months ended August 31, 2022, amortization of $2,119 and $6,357 was expensed. During the twelve months ended August 31, 2022, additional intangibles were added related to the asset acquisition in the amount of $38,638.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nAt August 31, 2022, an asset impairment evaluation resulted in the Company recording $35,762,550 in impairment expense in the fourth quarter ended August 31, 2022, and a carrying value of $42,980,076 for the intangible assets. The company had recorded impairment expenses of $17,598 in previous quarters, to total $35,780,148 for the fiscal year. The calculation of the carrying value of the Mioxal net assets was informed by the terms of the subsequent sale of those assets on November 7, 2022, as calculated below:\nValuation at the sale of Mioxal:\nCash to be received by the Company\n$ 100,000\nFV of 350,000 shares transferred to Buyer ($0.13 per share)\n(45,500 )\nDebt assumed/forgiven by Buyer\n39,500,000\nNPV of estimated future royalty cash stream\n3,425,576\nTotal estimated value of intangible assets at 8-31-2022\n42,980,076\nCarrying value of intangible assets at 8-31-2022\n$ 78,742,626\nImpairment expense at 8-31-2022 on intangible assets\n$ (35,762,550 )\nThe assumptions used for estimated future royalty cash stream included 1) 5% royalty on gross margin for a five-year period of estimated sales in the United States, with a two-year introductory delay in taking the product to market, 2) a similar royalty on international sales, with an additional two-year introductory delay and an increased cost of 15% for additive distribution costs, 3) an estimate of approximately 200,000 units sold in year 1 of the projected royalty stream for a total sales estimate of approximately $7,500,000, and 4) sales growth rates of 100% for each of the years 2 through 4, decreasing to 60% in year 5. Growth rate in any subsequent year would be expected to drop off significantly or to 0%, however, those possible future years are not included in the project revenues, costs or gross merging. The projections of foundational sales volumes, revenues and costs were performed by industry experts in January 2022 as part of an independent product evaluation. As with all projections, Management cannot assure that the estimated amounts will be actualized.\nSubsequent to the end of the period, the Company completed the disposition of all of the Mioxal intellectual property and intangible assets and related debt. See Note 12 Subsequent Events.\nNOTE 4 - EQUITY INVESTMENT\nOn April 27, 2020, under the Libertas Participation Agreement, the Company received 45,053 Warrants of QSI Holding Company, a private company, (QSI and QSI Warrants) to purchase common stock priced at $3.111 per share for common stock par value $0.00001 expiring the 7th anniversary after the issue date. Upon issuance, the Company valued the warrants using the Black Scholes model yielding a total value of $58,443. The Company used the following assumptions upon measurement: QSI Holding Company value per common share of $3.4520, a life of 7 years, an exercise price of $3.111, a risk-free rate of 0.56% and volatility of 32%. In addition, the Company recorded a discount of $58,443 and will record income over the 7-year life of the warrants. On November 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Warrant Assignment Agreement to assign the QSI Warrants to Calvary Fund 1 LP (Calvary). In consideration of the assignment of the Warrant, Calvary forgave the principal and interest owed by the Company under the Calvary $150,000 promissory note dated August 30, 2021. The warrants are recorded as an equity investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for $0 and $11,132 at August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively. The Company recorded other income of $0 and $8,349 for the twelve months ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nNOTE 5 - NOTES PAYABLE\nShort-Term Notes Payable\nOn September 14, 2017, the Company issued a $10,000 promissory note to a limited liability company. The loan bears interest at 5% and has a maturity date of September 15, 2018. The unpaid balance including accrued interest was $12,482 and $11,982 at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company is in default with the repayment terms of the note. Interest of $2,482 and $1,982 was accrued for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nOn August 30, 2021, the Company issued a $150,000 promissory note to Calvary. The loan bears interest at 18% and has a maturity date of August 30, 2022. On November 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Warrant Assignment Agreement to assign the QSI Holding Company, Inc. (QSI) Warrants issued on April 29, 2020 from QSI to the Company, to Calvary. In consideration of the assignment of the Warrant, Calvary forgave the Company from the principal and interest owing under the Calvary $150,000 promissory note dated August 30, 2021 to fully satisfy the principal and interest owed under the promissory note. The unpaid principal and interest on the date of the assignment of the Warrant to Calvary was $155,088. Investments were reduced by $11,132 and the Company recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $143,956 in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nThe unpaid balance including accrued interest was $0 and $150,074 at August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively.\nConvertible Notes Payable\nOn April 27, 2020, the Company signed a convertible promissory note with an investor. The $259,615 note was issued with an original issue discount of $57,115 and bears interest at 0% per year. The Company recorded the self-amortizing convertible promissory note using the effective interest rate method to calculate the loan payable at $202,500 and accrued interest at $57,115. The note requires nine equal payments due starting June 15, 2020 for $28,846. In the event the Company fails to make the $28,846 installment payment by the 15th day of each designated month and/or fails to cure any missed installment payment within five (5) calendars days following the due date, or the Company defaults, the defaulted amount owed shall be 130% of the total outstanding balance owed by the Company. The default interest rate for missing an installment payment shall be 18% and the conversion into common stock shall be at a price of $0.02 per common stock. The note principal and interest are convertible into shares of common stock at the lower of $0.02 per share or a 35% discount to the lowest traded price of the Companys common stock during the 10 prior trading days including the day the notice of conversion is received by the Company. The note matured on February 21, 2021. The Company made the first payment on June 15, 2020 for $28,846 and a partial payment of $10,000 on July 15, 2020. The original issue discount is amortized through the term of the note. The unpaid principal and interest balance was $0 at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe conversion features meet the definition of a derivative liability instrument because the conversion rate is variable and therefore does not meet the fixed-for-fixed criteria outlined in ASC 815-40-15. As a result, the conversion features of the notes are recorded as a derivative liability at fair value and marked-to-market each period with the changes in fair value each period charged or credited to other income (expense).\nAt August 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding principal balances of the convertible notes payable, net of debt discount was $0. The Company recorded interest accretion on the debt discount of $0 and $114,599 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nNOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAs of August 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company owed $0 and $64,600, respectively to its former President and Director. The balance due is recorded as related party payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company has a contract with two consulting and pharmaceutical firms owned by the Chief Science Officer, Salzman Group LLC and Herring Creek Pharmaceuticals, under which research and development activities are performed on behalf of the Company. During the fiscal year 2022, the Company paid $150,000 for a security deposit, $131,500 for research and development fees and assumed $67,000 in a liability from ST Biosciences at the acquisition of the assets described in Note 3 Asset Acquisition. The $67,000 liability was released during the period and was credited to the Mioxal intangible asset. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company owed $2,665 and $0 to these two firms and owed salary of $4,615 and $0 to Dr. Salzman.\nAs of August 31, 2022, the Company owed Jeffrey Kraws, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, $17,308 in unpaid salary and $83,516 in unpaid bonuses.

There was no such obligation at August 31, 2021.\nNOTE 7 - LEASE LIABILITY\nOn January 1, 2022, we adopted ASC Topic 842 - Leases. Under this new guidance, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases. Upon adoption, we recognized operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $619,825.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nLessee accounting\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Our assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for the majority of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset.\nA lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease costs are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease costs are split, where amortization of the ROU asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense.\nUnder the guidance of ASC 842, operating leases are included in right-of-use assets, current lease liabilities, and noncurrent lease liabilities on our balance sheets. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at transition date in determining the present value of future payments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made but excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, if any. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLease extensions\nMany leases have options to either extend or terminate the lease. In determining the lease term, we considered all available contract extensions that are reasonably certain of occurring.\nOperating leases\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company entered into an operating lease for office space. The lease is effective for 3 years from the commencement date with automatic renewal at the expiration date. The lease agreement may be terminated earlier upon ninety days prior written notice by either party. The lease requires adjustment upon renewal with an increase to the monthly rent by 10% of the monthly rent due for the month preceding such renewal date or market rate, whichever is the greater amount.\nThe following table summarizes balance sheet data related to leases at August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021:\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nAssets\nOperating lease right of use assets\n$ 619,825\n$ -\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(137,739 )\n-\nTotal operating lease right of use assets\n$ 482,086\n$ -\nLiabilities\nOperating lease liability, current\n$ 199,203\n$ -\nOperating lease liability, noncurrent\n298,423\n-\nTotal lease liabilities\n$ 497,626\n$ -\nOperating lease liability is presented net of lease payments.

In accordance with the terms of all such instruments, the conversion ratio of the Companys outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and its various convertible promissory notes, together with the exercise price of its outstanding warrants, were proportionally adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split.\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock.\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nAs discussed in Note 3 - Asset Acquisition, on November 9, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the assets, including intellectual property assets, relating to Mioxal\u00ae, a nutraceutical complex composed of essential amino acids, natural coenzymes and minerals, and assumed certain liabilities held by ST Biosciences, Ltd., a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (STB). As part consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 19,831,623 shares of Common Stock valued at $40,654,827 or $2.05 per share.\nThere were 20,020,239 and 188,616 common shares issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nOn September 30, 2022, a party identified as New You Inc. filed a complaint with the District Court of Clark County, Nevada against Innovation 1 Biotech, Inc, ST Biosciences LTD, Jeffrey Kraws and Jason Frankovich. The complaint alleges that during Mr. Frankovichs service to New You Inc. as Chairman of the Board of Directors, concurrent with Mr. Frankovichs and Mr. Krawss services as executives of ST Biosciences LTD, Mr. Frankovich converted funds away from New You Inc. to satisfy obligations of ST Biosciences LTD and/or Innovation1 and/or to enrich Frankovich and Kraws. The amount of the claim is a total of $249,020 plus damages in excess of $30,000 and includes a claim for legal fees. The Companys legal firm has evaluated the claims of the complaint and together with Innovation1 management believes the claims to be without merit. The Company intends to defend against the complaint and believes any potential liability to be $0.\nNOTE 10 - DERIVATIVE LIABILITY\nAs of August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, the Company had no derivative liability in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet, and recorded a gain on change in fair value of the derivative liability of $0 and 1,454,480 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the Company amortized $0 and $114,599 to interest accretion during the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the preferred stock warrants and derivative convertible notes payable.\nNOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Companys policy is to provide for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) legislation reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% and is effective June 22, 2018 for the Company. We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. When it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit.\nWe provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carryforward period.\nThe Company is not aware of any uncertain tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2022 or during the prior three years applicable under FASB ASC 740. We did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet. All tax returns for the Company after its fiscal 2019 year remain open for examination.\nThe differences between the provision (benefit) for federal income taxes and federal income taxes computed using the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and state tax rate of 6.5% were as follows:\nAugust 31, 2022\nAugust 31, 2021\nFederal income tax expense (benefit) based on statutory rate\n$ (8,545,000 )\n21.0 %\n$ (192,000 )\n21.0 %\nState income tax expense (benefit), based on statutory rate\n(2,665,000 )\n6.5 %\n-\n-\n%\nRevision of NOL estimates and state effective tax rates\n(182,000 )\n0.5 %\n-\n-\n%\nIncrease in valuation allowance\n11,392,000\n(28.0 )%\n192,000\n(21.0 )%\nTotal taxes on income (loss)\n$ -\n-\n%\n$ -\n-\n%\nInnovation1 Biotech, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nThe net deferred tax assets consist of the following:\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nDeferred tax assets arising from:\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$ 2,163,000\n$ 616,000\nImpairment expenses\n9,845,000\nLess: valuation allowance\n(12,008,000 )\n(616,000 )\nNet deferred tax asset\n$ -\n$ -\nThe change in the valuation allowance for the year ended August 31, 2022 was an increase of $11,392,000.\nNOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date of August 31, 2022, through the date which the consolidated financial statements were issued.\nDeparture of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors\nOn September 9, 2022, the Board of Directors of Innovation1 Biotech Inc. appointed Frederick E.

As part of the disposition, certain shareholders of the Company transferred an aggregate of 350,000 shares of the Companys currently outstanding common stock, to Ingenius and Ingenius agreed to pay the Company (i) $100,000 upon the first to occur of Ingenius first sale or commercialization of the Mioxal product or Ingenius sale, license, transfer or other disposition of the Mioxal product to a third party, and (ii) a 5% royalty on worldwide net sales of the Mioxal product by Ingenius or a third party commencing on the date of the first sale of Mioxal products and ending on the 18-month anniversary of the last to expire of any patent covering the Mioxal products. Additionally, Ingenius agreed to release the Company from all of its liabilities and obligations relating to the Mioxal products and indemnify the Company from all claims relating to the Mioxal product following the date of the disposition.\nAmendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws\nOn November 18, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company (Board) approved and adopted a second amendment and restatement of the Companys bylaws (the Amended and Restated Bylaws), effective as of such date.

These actions were taken pursuant to NRS 78.120 and in accordance with Article IX of the Companys prior bylaws.\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement\nSubsequent to the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company has entered into a private placement to receive net cash proceeds up to $300,000, net of original issue discount, from secured convertible promissory notes with attached $0.08 warrants to purchase up to 4,411,764 shares of common stock. Each note is discounted 15% with a maturity date of 18 months from original issuance. The notes bear interest of 8% per annum to be paid monthly. Each note is convertible into common shares by dividing the outstanding principal on the note by the conversion price of $0.08. The warrants are exercisable for a period of seven years at an exercise price of $0.08 per share. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer are responsible for conducting an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2022 as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nMANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs of August 31, 2022, management, consisting of our principal executive officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys President, who is our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u00b7\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u00b7\nProvide reasonable assurance our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u00b7\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statement.\nIn evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our management used the criteria set forth by the 2013 version of Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, completed only by Jeffrey J. Kraws, our Chief Executive Officer, and a director, who also serves as our principal financial officer, Mr. Kraws concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below.\nThis was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (i) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, and (ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer, who also serves as our principal financial officer, in connection with the review of our financial statements as of August 31, 2022.\nManagement believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. If we have sufficient funds and are able to hire additional personnel, we plan to implement additional oversight and monitoring procedures to our internal controls next year.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended August 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to our directors that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our directors and us with regard to our directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\nThe Company does not have an audit committee financial expert serving on an audit committee.

Executive officers, directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on our review of filings made on the SEC website, and the fact of us not receiving certain forms or written representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements, we believe that, during the year ended August 31, 2022, our executive officers, directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.\nSTOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nWe have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications, and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year, our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.\nCODE OF ETHICS\nThe Company has not adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officers, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions.
