There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with either listing requirement.\nOur Industry\nWe participate in the large and growing global market for connectivity and essential communications infrastructure. This market is being driven by the growth in demand for data-intensive bandwidth and the necessity for reduced latency (the time it takes to send data from one point to another) associated with the continued demand of smartphones, tablets and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, as well as the proliferation of data centers, big data, cloud-based services, streaming media content and IoT. In addition, video and gaming distribution over the broadband IP network is transforming how content is managed and consumed overall. This increase in data usage and demand is taxing available broadband of many service providers, which requires far more efficient technologies to meet demand. For example, in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, a leading media streaming service reduced the quality of videos from high definition to standard definition in certain regions in order to free up additional bandwidth required by workers performing online functions from their homes.\nTodays cellular networks are predominantly based on 4G technologies. These networks constantly undergo expansion of coverage and densification with additional sites to cater to higher demands for speeds and to make more services available per given area. According to certain publications and as of the fourth quarter 2019, 33 operators across 18 countries, representing 8% of the global mobile connections base (excluding cellular IoT), have launched commercial 5G mobile services, and 77 operators have announced plans to launch 5G services in the coming months. These investments in 5G radio network infrastructure, and consequently, associated wireless data hauling, are expected to gradually increase during the next several years. In order to allocate spectrum resources for 4G and 5G, many network operators are shutting down their 2G and/or 3G network (a network sunset) in order to re-allocate radio access network frequency bands to 4.5 and 5G services. These market dynamics of network expansion and densification have resulted in higher demand for wireless hauling capacity at increased density, requiring more sophisticated services over the network at far higher volumes than were available in recent years. Such services include the many 5G use cases, which among others, include enhanced mobile broadband, mission critical services, IoT and Industrial IoT, gigabit broadband to homes, multi gigabits services to enterprises and more.\nThe term 5G is misunderstood by most consumers who believe it is simply another layer of technology over the top of current 4G LTE infrastructures. However, this is not the case. While 4G LTE Advanced is a part of a large platform upon which 5G rests, according to many industry studies, significantly more 4G LTE/A will be required before 5G becomes a reality. 5G is an entirely new infrastructure that must be standardized for widespread adoption and must be agile enough to accommodate wireless devices of all kinds, not just cellular smartphones. The 5G enhancements specific to IoT will enable the connection of the internet to telemedical devices, gaming, video and television, smart-home devices, such as thermostats, alarms, lighting and garage doors, smartphones, driverless cars and traffic signals, laptops, desktops, Wi-Fi, logistic reporting devices on semi-tractor trucks and trains and a plethora of other use cases. It must do so seamlessly and with a fraction of the current round-trip response time of data. This requires that data centers be closer to the networks edge where the devices connect to the wireless small cells. As a result, data centers and many of the other functions will require virtualization and eventually artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning to route data requests to these virtualized data centers to keep latency to a minimum.\nThere are several major trends that we expect to drive network deployments and investment. The GSM Association (GSMA), a mobile telecom association to which most large infrastructure participants and mobile carriers are members, nearly mirrors our findings and impressions in its report on the state of mobile internet connectivity. Many of these trends and findings follow.\nThe Challenges of Connectedness\nIt is said in business that to remain static is to die. To understand the need for technological advancements and infrastructure growth in the cellular telecommunications industry, one must first understand the market factors driving these changes. In 2018, nearly 300 million people connected to mobile internet data for the first time. This increased the total number of internet connected users to more than 3.5 billion people worldwide. This type of connectivity now drives the global economy as more and more diverse commerce is conducted through wireless data access. However, since lower-income countries and regions have only approximately 40% of their population connected to the internet compared to 75% in high-income regions, these lower income areas are finding it increasingly difficult to raise their social and economic status. Getting these deficient regions (and the approximately 4 billion people inhabiting those regions who are unable to connect to the internet) connected is only one challenge. The other and equally difficult challenge is the density of urban areas in the higher income areas and the sophistication of the electronic communications and computing devices in those areas that require increasingly faster data. We plan to target both challenges by providing economical solutions and infrastructure building blocks to lower-income geographic areas around the world, which we expect we will initially sell through our resellers, distributors and other partners, while leading the world in innovative new technologies to make the realization of 5G and the next generations (nG) a reality.\nEvolving Network Architecture and Technology\nThe pace of change in networking has increased in recent years as consumers and data-driven businesses utilize more bandwidth with increasingly complex mobile and connected devices. Cellular networks are now experiencing exponential growth in network infrastructures, which is revolutionizing how consumers connect to each other and changing the network architecture needed to support consumer demand. This trend requires better network coverage, greater broadband access, increased capacity, and larger data storage capacity.\nOur customers are working to transition their networks to become faster, more responsive, and more efficient. We believe the following findings will continue to impact our company and the industry during 2021 and beyond.\n(1) Coverage Gaps Declining: Less than 10% of people globally (approximately 750 million) now have no access to a mobile broadband network as compared to approximately 24% only five years ago.\n(2) Usage Gaps an Issue: Approximately 3.3 billion people live in areas in which internet coverage exists but do utilize it. In other words, the usage gap is four times greater than the coverage gap.\n(3) Affordability: Mobile broadband usage is becoming more affordable across all regions, but its affordability is still short of the desired 2% or less of monthly per capita income. This cost of usage is keeping some users from participating online. There is also a perception in many low-income regions that internet usage will not contribute enough to their security, safety, and commerce to warrant the expense. In addition, device cost remains high and thus a barrier to entry.\n(4) Prevalence of Use: Social media and instant messaging account for the majority of mobile usage. Online calls, news links, video streaming services such as YouTube and Vimeo, and gaming are the other most prevalent activities.\n(5) Macro Level: The mobile industry contributed $4 trillion dollars to the global gross domestic product (GDP) last year (or almost 5% of the total GDP). A recent study conducted by Dr. Raul Katz and Fernando Collorda for the International Telecommunication Union, a specialized agency of the United Nations for information and communication technologies, concluded that a 10% increase in mobile broadband connectivity would lead to an increase in GDP of roughly 2% in both developed and underdeveloped regions.\n(6) Micro Level: Gallup and GSMA polls both found that mobile ownership and internet connectivity is associated with an improvement in peoples lives, as evidenced by increases in net positive emotions and average life evaluations (not the same as longevity).\nTransition from Traditional to the IoT\nThe IoT is rapidly evolving from an industry trend to a tangible, mature, established technology. Many operators have begun to transition to operable 5G networks and have announced deployments of 5G technology. This technology is primarily operating at higher frequency, such as millimeter wave radios, and using higher order (more efficient) modulation methods to improve network capacity. The number of 5G-enabled devices is expected to continue to increase during 2023 and accelerate beyond that. The primary benefits of 5G are expected to include:\n\u25cf enhanced mobile broadband to support significant improvement in data rates and user experience in both the uplink and downlink;\n\u25cf massive M2M communications capabilities to support the expected billions of connections between machines as well as short bursts of information to other systems; and\n\u25cf low latency, high\u202freliability to support applications that are critical or are needed in real time, like factory machines, virtual reality, and augmentation.\nWireless operators will need to both acquire and launch new spectrum for 5G, as well as continue their strategy of re-allocation of spectrum from one generation to another. Some of this spectrum will be at much higher frequencies and will use new technologies to deliver exceptional amounts of bandwidth to subscribers. 5G also requires significant fiber infrastructure to connect wireless access points to each other to improve the response time of the network. As wireless operators transition toward 5G, they must also manage the fundamental network deployment issues of site acquisition, power, backhaul and in-building wireless proliferation.\nIn addition to investment required by wireless operators, the transition to 5G could also spark an investment cycle by cable operators as they upgrade their networks to compete with fixed wireless broadband, which could become a viable alternative to traditional broadband internet access.\nOur Growth Strategy\nUnder the leadership of our senior management team, we intend to address and exploit the large and growing market for internet connectivity and essential communications infrastructure as we continue to build our sales, marketing, and operations groups to support our planned growth while focusing on increasing operating margins through cost control measures. While organic growth will be our primary focus in driving our business forward, we expect acquisitions and select teaming and partnering arrangements with other companies will play a strategic role in strengthening our existing product and service lines and providing cross-selling opportunities. We are pursuing several growth strategies, including:\n\u25cf Continue to Innovate and Extend our Technology Leadership. Mobile broadband infrastructure innovations are required to dramatically improve the commercial viability of both the 4G LTE and 5G buildouts. It is well documented that substantially more infrastructure is required for 5G to be viable. However, with the huge increase in radio access network components required for an IoT/5G buildout, relative capital costs must come down to allow data to remain affordable. This requires doing more with less through innovation. We expect our continued investments in research and development will enable us to continue to provide innovative products to the marketplace. For example, in 2024 we expect to demonstrate initial products incorporating our patented In-Band Full-Duplex technology, which is expected to greatly improve wireless transmission efficiency, and as a result, the data throughput, of wireless spectrum channels. We also continue to pursue VEOs SiP research, discoveries and developments, which we believe will not only eliminate the current log-jam many internet providers and data centers experience by providing significantly greater data speed and throughput in the switch that converts data bits from voltage modulations in the copper used in radios to light modulations that are used in fiber, and vice versa, but will also form the technological basis for the future of chip-to-chip light computing.\n\u25cf Enhance Sales Growth. We intend to generate additional growth opportunities by:\n\u25cf Growing our customer base and geographic markets. We intend to drive new customer growth by expanding our direct sales force focused on the mobile infrastructure markets. The initial focus of our direct sales program will be North America, with foreign sales coming through licensed channel partners and advisory personnel. In addition, we expect to leverage our existing base of resellers and more than 700 legacy customers to help proliferate the knowledge globally of our technical superiorities and increase our customer base.\n\u25cf Increasing penetration within existing customers. We plan to continue to increase our product penetration within our existing customer base by expanding the breadth of our product and service offerings to provide for continued cross-selling opportunities. For example, while we believe DragonWave is well known for its microwave backhaul radio products, we have additional millimeter wave frequency designs that can be offered to existing customers, as well as new customers. Further, the Fastback IBR radio products have seen a strong increase in customer demand over other lines and we plan to continue to feed that demand over the coming year.\n\u25cf Focus on Innovation to Solve Critical Problems. We plan to build on our legacy of innovation and on our portfolio of patents and patent applications by continuing to invest in research and development. We expect to focus on expanding the functionality of our backhaul and access equipment products, while investing in capabilities that address new market opportunities. We believe this strategy will enable new high-growth opportunities and allow us to continue to deliver differentiated high-value products and services to our customers. We also intend to utilize our deep industry expertise to offer unique perspectives to solve customers challenges. We intend to focus our investment on high-growth markets.\n\u25cf Become a Preferred Partner to our Customers. We plan to expand our position within the telecom industry by developing and enhancing value-creating partner relationships with our customers, suppliers and distributors, as well as our channel and technology partners. We intend to expand these relationships by innovating, collaborating and selling with our customers. We expect to meet our commitments and maintain our product quality while collaborating with our customers to ensure we are providing solutions to their key network challenges.\n\u25cf Pursue Strategic Relationships. We expect to continue to pursue strategic technology and distribution relationships, alliances and acquisitions that will help us align with the strategic priorities of our customers. We intend to continue to invest in technologies to ensure interoperability across the ecosystems that support our customers most critical business processes through our partner programs. We continue to work with current industry partners while exploring a range of new partnerships to expand the products and services we offer.\n\u25cf Grow Revenues and Market Share through Selective Acquisitions. Though not our strategy, we continue to explore the potential acquisition of private companies or technologies that can enhance our earnings and offer complementary products and services or expand our geographic and industry reach. We believe such acquisitions can help us to accelerate our revenue growth, leverage our existing strengths and capture and retain more work in-house as a prime contractor for our customers, thereby contributing to our profitability. We also believe that increased scale will enable us to bid and take on larger contracts.\n\u25cf Increase Operating Margins by Leveraging Operating Efficiencies. We believe that by centralizing administrative functions, consolidating insurance coverage, and eliminating redundancies across our newly acquired businesses, we will be positioned to offer more integrated end-to-end solutions and improve operating margins. We will also seek to reduce our manufacturing costs to increase our margins.\nOur Products\nAll our products enhance or directly contribute to the overall telecommunication infrastructure and fall within the following product groups:\nMicro and Millimeter Microwave Technologies and Products\nWe design, manufacture, and sell best-in-class (as defined by power, signal efficiency and range), microwave packet radio equipment for telecommunications and data. Our Harmony-branded line of backhaul radios are data efficient and offer one of the most powerful, longest-range solutions for backhaul in the industry. The Fastback Intelligent Backhaul Radio (IBR) offers a unique and patented point-to-any-point microwave backhaul solution that solves critical issues across both private and public networks. Our line of radio models have the following characteristics:\n\u25cf Harmony Enhanced MC: Our Harmony Enhanced MC radios are high-capacity packet microwave radios that build upon the Harmony Enhanced family of radios by delivering a multi-carrier channel system and doubling the capacity available in a single microwave outdoor unit. Because the radio and modem are integrated into a single highly\u202fcompact outdoor unit, Harmony Enhanced MC is a zero-footprint solution that eliminates rack congestion and minimizes colocation space. The ultra-high power increases the overall system gain and allows for deployment of smaller dishes, higher order modulations or increased link availability. Our Harmony MC radios also achieve the highest degree of spectral efficiency (with 4096 QAM capability, 112-megahertz (MHz) channel support, and leading system gain) in the marketplace, delivering more capacity per channel with a longer reach than any other all-outdoor microwave system.\n\u25cf Fastback IBR: The Fastback IBR fuses advanced radio frequency and software-defined radio technologies; sophisticated switching and LTE silicon, proprietary architecture, signal processing and antenna array design - all in a single device. The result is an intelligent, versatile, and easily installed radio device that delivers multiple firsts in backhaul operation. The IBR is packed with advances, including highest speed with lowest latency, breakthroughs in transmission to ease set-up and mitigate interference, on-board power to simplify install, and a compact design that guarantees deployment in any location or environment. These innovations address customers real-world challenges of network densification, both technically and economically. From macrocell upgrades in line of site (LOS) and non-line of site (nLOS) conditions, to new connectivity across fully-obstructed NLOS environments, the IBR has proven its ability to delivery carrier grade reliability.\nEngineering efforts are underway now with two additional enhancements - full-duplex and transpositional modulation waveforms that will be programmed to significantly enhance the spectral efficiency of our microwave radios, and, we believe, will far exceed our competitors offerings. These enhancements have the following characteristics:\n\u25cf In-Band Full-Duplex Technology: During 2024, we expect to demonstrate our first microwave products incorporating our proprietary in-band full-duplex technology that was innovated by our Lextrum subsidiary. This technology, which is useful in almost any wireless communication system, functions by essentially doubling the data throughput on existing antennae by sending and receiving simultaneously on the same frequency. This capability is critical in backhaul networks (tower-to-tower applications) and is a fundamental component of 5G wireless technology if it is to operate most efficiently. Following commercial rollout of this technology in our own products, Lextrum expects to begin licensing its technology for use to other radio designers and manufacturers, which we believe will generate license and royalty fee revenues commencing in late 2024.\nSoftware Offerings\nOur Mobile Edge Compute, Edge Cloud, transforms communication networks into powerful cloud-computing infrastructures for applications and services, including augmented and virtual reality, Internet of Things (IoT), edge analytics, high-definition video, connected cars, autonomous drones and more. SAGUNA allows these next-generation applications to run closer to the user in a wireless network, dramatically cutting down on latency, which is a fundamental and critical requirement of 5G networks. SAGUNAs Edge Cloud operates on general purpose computing hardware but can be optimized to support the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning features through dedicated accelerators.\nTethered Drones and Aerostats\nThrough our Drone Aviation and SKS subsidiaries, we design, develop, market, sell and provide logistical services for specialized tethered aerial monitoring and communications platforms serving national defense, security, and commercial customers for use in applications including surveillance and communications. Through Drone Aviation, we focus primarily on the development of a tethered aerostat known as the WASP, which is principally designed for military and security applications where it provides secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether. Through SKS, we offer our HoverMast line of quadrotor-tethered drones that feature uninterruptible ground-based power, fiber optic communications for cyber immunity, and the ability to operate in GPS-denied environments while delivering dramatically improved situational awareness and communications capabilities to users. HoverMast is utilized by the Israeli government for border patrol and coastal applications and is also deployed in several international markets.\nOur core aerostat products are designed to provide real-time, semi-persistent situational awareness to various military and national security customers such as the U.S. Department of Defense and units of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to improve security at the nations ports and borders. The WASP tethered aerostat system provides customers with tactical, highly-mobile and cost-effective aerial monitoring and communications capabilities in remote or austere locations where existing infrastructure is lacking or not accessible. Current WASP products include the WASP tactical aerostat and WASP Lite, a rapidly-deployable, compact aerostat system. WASP aerostats are either self-contained on a trailer that can be towed by a military all-terrain vehicle (MATV) or a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle (MRAP) or other standard vehicle, operated from the bed of a pickup truck or UTV or mounted to a building rooftop. They are designed to provide semi-persistent, mobile, real-time day/night high-definition video for ISR, detection of improvised explosive devices, border security and other governmental and civilian uses. The HoverMast 100 model system sold by SKS has been mounted in permanent locations, as well as on mobile platforms such as certain long-bed pickup trucks and marine vessels. With its imbedded fiber optic tether system, the HoverMast offers a myriad of optical sensors, signal collection devices and communication radios and has had a sophisticated mounted airborne radar. We believe our Drone Aviation and SKS products also can also be utilized for disaster response missions by supporting two-way and cellular communications and acting as a repeater or provider of wireless networking.\nBoth the WASP and WASP Lite aerostat systems employ a tethered envelope filled with helium gas for lift to carry either a stabilized ISR or communications payload, a portable ground control station and a datalink between the ground station and the envelope. Hovering between 500 and 1,500 feet above the ground, the systems provide surveillance and communications capabilities with relatively low acquisition and operating costs. The systems require an operational crew of a minimum of two people, have relatively simple maintenance procedures, and feature quick retrieval and helium top-off for re-inflation. The HoverMast system can deploy and recover the tethered drone unit at heights ranging from 15 feet to 330 feet in minutes. SKS was idled in June 2022 and subsequently sold in March 2023.\nOur Services\nIn addition to our products, we offer maintenance and support services, as well as a selection of other professional services. We utilize a multi-tiered support model to deliver services that leverage the capabilities of our own direct resources, channels partners and other third-party organizations.\nOur professional services are provided primarily by our Silver Bullet subsidiary, which engineers, designs and develops a broad range of next-generation network systems and system components, including:\n\u25cf hardware and software design and development, including ISR, embedded designs, high-speed digital and radio frequency (RF), printed circuit board design, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs;\n\u25cf large-scale network protocol development and software-defined radio systems; and\n\u25cf wireless communications designs in tactical, automotive and cellular communication systems, municipal/public networks, security systems, and consumer electronics.\nWe believe a broad range of services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we employ remote technical support engineers, spare parts planning and logistics staff and professional services consultants with proven network experience to provide our services.\nCustomers\nWe manufacture and sell our portfolio of telecommunications-related products on a global basis to over 700 legacy customers. Our customers include a large percentage of mobile cellular carriers, large international corporations, governments, and private network users. We believe our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills, experience and varied product lines across markets and reduces our exposure to a single end market. Additionally, we believe the diversity of our customer base is an important strength of our company.\nWe believe there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that can meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. We believe we have positioned our offerings and resources to compete effectively in this environment. As an industry participant in the telecommunications microwave backhaul segment, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers on a global basis. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to the needs of these customer when designing new products and technical solutions. By working with customers in developing new products and technologies, we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our portfolio of products. In addition, we have concentrated our efforts on service, procurement and manufacturing improvements designed to increase product quality and performance and lower product lead-time and cost.\nManufacturing, Suppliers and Vendors\nThe manufacturing of our microwave radios and other network communications products is outsourced to principally two third-party contract manufacturers, Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (Benchmark) and SMC, LLC (SMC), which are well-established contract manufacturers with expertise in the telecom equipment industry. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as we reduce our manufacturing overhead and inventory and allows us to adjust quickly to changing customer demand. SMC provides Printed Circuit Board (PCB) component mounting services for our Fastback IBR radio assembly. Benchmark assembles our DragonWave radio products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.\nThe manufacturing agreement we entered with Benchmark does not provide for any minimum purchase commitments and had an initial term of two years, which now automatically renews for one-year terms, unless either party gives written notice to the other party not less than 90 days prior to the last day of the applicable term. Additionally, this agreement may be terminated by either party (i) with advance written notice provided to the other party, subject to certain notice period limitations, or (ii) with written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement. Our SMC agreement provides us with a great deal of flexibility and provisions therein allow us to limit or increase output.\nWe believe that these contract manufacturing relationships allow us to operate our business efficiently by focusing our internal efforts on the development of our technologies and products providing us with substantial scale-up capacity. We regularly test quality on-site at Benchmarks facility and SMCs facility, and we obtain full quality inspection reports. We also maintain non-disclosure agreements with Benchmark and SMC.\nWe and our contract manufacturing partners purchase a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of our network communications products, including (i) precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products and (iii) plastic materials. We also purchase a wide variety of mechanical and electronic components for the manufacturing of such products. Such raw materials and components are generally available throughout the world and are purchased domestically, when possible, from a variety of suppliers. We are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or components. We do not anticipate substantial difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary to produce our network communications products.\nHowever, certain materials and equipment for our Drone Aviation and SKS products are custom made for those products and are available only from a limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier could cause delays in delivery of the products if another supplier cannot promptly be found or if the quality of such replacement suppliers components is inferior or unacceptable. For a discussion of certain risks related to raw materials and components, see Risk Factors in this report.\nCompetition\nThe telecommunications and mobile broadband markets are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with domestic and international companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. We encounter substantial competition in most of our markets, although we believe we have few competitors that compete with us in performance capabilities across all our product lines and markets. Our principal competitors in one or more of our product lines or markets include Ericsson, Nokia, Cambium, Ceragon, Aviat and Huawei. We also compete with internally developed network solutions of certain network equipment manufacturers, including Facebook, Google, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Finally, we face competition from working groups and associations that are the result of joint developments among certain of the competitors listed above. Consolidation in the telecommunications and mobile broadband industry has increased in recent years, and future consolidation could further intensify the competitive pressures that we face.\nThe principal competitive factors upon which we compete include performance, power consumption, rapid innovation, breadth of product line, availability, product reliability, reputation, level of integration and cost, multi-sourcing and selling price. We believe that we compete effectively by offering higher levels of customer value through high speed, high density, low power consumption, broad integration of wireless radio functions, software intelligence for configuration, control and monitoring, cost-efficiency, ease of deployment and collaborative product design. We cannot be certain we will continue to compete effectively.\nWe may also face competition from companies that may expand into our industry and introduce additional competitive products. The same standardization that allows for the integration of our products into wireless infrastructure systems carries the side effect of lowing the competitive threshold for new market entrants. Existing and potential customers and strategic partners are also potential competitors. These customers may internally develop or acquire additional competitive products or technologies, selectively or through consolidation of the companies in our industry, which may cause them to reduce or cease their purchases from us.\nResearch and Development\nWe generally implement our product development strategy through product design teams and collaborative initiatives with customers, which can also result in our company obtaining approved vendor status for our customers new products and programs. We focus our research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that we believe have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one-to-three-year period. We seek to have our products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which we believe will provide additional sources of future revenue. By developing application-specific products, we can decrease our exposure to standard products, which are more likely to experience greater pricing pressure.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property rights. We generally rely on patent, trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of intellectual property developed for us and require that all proprietary information remain confidential.\nWe maintain a program designed to identify technology that is appropriate for patent and trade secret protection, and we file patent applications in the United States and, when appropriate, certain other countries for inventions that we consider significant. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 130 patents granted in the United States and foreign jurisdictions that expire between 2022 and 2040. As of such date, we also had approximately 25 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use third parties patents. Although our business is not materially dependent upon any one patent, our patent rights and the products made and sold under our patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of our business.\nIn addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, design rights and copyrights. We control access to and use of our software, technology, and other proprietary information through internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent, and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology, and other proprietary information. In addition, we have expanded our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.\nRegulation\nAs our customers operate around the world and, to a limited degree, we rely upon non-U.S. manufacturers to make our products, our business and ability to successfully compete for business in our industry may become dependent upon global supply, manufacturing and customer relationships that are affected by the trade and tariff policies of each country in which we operate. Increased tariffs on parts and components imposed by the countries in which our product components may be sourced can increase our production costs, and increased tariffs imposed by the countries in which our products are sold can increase the cost of our products to our customers.\nCertain of our products and services are subject to export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department, and similar laws and regulations that apply in other jurisdictions in which we distribute or sell our products and services. Export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations include restrictions and prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services and on the transfer of parts, components and related technical information and know-how to certain countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities. U.S. regulators may also impose new restrictions on previously non-controlled emerging or foundational items and technologies for which exports to countries such as China are deemed to present undesirable national security risks. Even without such legislative or regulatory action, we would be prohibited from exporting our products to any foreign recipient if we have knowledge that a violation of U.S. export regulations has occurred, is about to occur or is intended to occur in connection with the item. Different countries may implement their own export control regulatory systems, which can affect the flow of parts, components, finished products and related technologies throughout the supply chain to and from suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers.\nIn addition, various countries regulate imports of certain products through permitting, licensing and transaction review procedures, and may enact laws that could limit our ability to produce or distribute our products or the ability of our customers to produce or distribute products into which our products are incorporated. The exportation, re-exportation, transfers within foreign countries and importation of our products and the parts, components, and technologies necessary to manufacture our products, including by our partners, must comply with these laws and regulations. Among these regulations are rules in the United States and other countries that prohibit companies such as Huawei from supplying products and services for national telecommunications networks. The U.S. government is developing regulatory mechanisms through which it may block imports into the United States of certain information and communications products and services designed, developed, manufactured or supplied by entities owned by, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary where the transaction presents an undue risk to U.S. information and communications technology or services, critical infrastructure or the digital economy of the United States, or other unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons. U.S. government procurement supply chain risk management regulations prohibit U.S. government agencies from directly or indirectly contracting to obtain certain telecommunications and video surveillance equipment, systems or services produced or performed by certain designated Chinese companies, and this prohibition is expected to be extended to prohibit U.S. government agencies from contracting with entities that use such equipment, systems or services, and to prohibit the use of U.S. government grant or loan proceeds to acquire such equipment, systems or services.\nWe are also subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations in other places where we do business. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering or making improper payments to governmental, political, and certain international organization officials for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or directing business. Our exposure for violating these laws and regulations increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition, we are subject to, or are expected to facilitate our customers compliance with, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, employee health and safety and the use of hazardous materials in, and the recycling of, our products.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed 25 full-time employees and 6 contractors for a total of 31 full-time equivalents (FTEs), consisting of 3 FTEs in research and development, 17 FTEs in operations, which includes manufacturing, supply chain, quality control and assurance, and 11 FTEs in executive, sales, marketing, general and administrative positions. The 6 contractors are in marketing and general and administrative roles. As a result of the reduction of workforce, the Company may face claims from terminated employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. In general, we consider our employee relations to be good. All employees are subject to contractual agreements that specify requirements on confidentiality and restrictions on working for competitors, as well as other standard matters. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties, described below, and all other information included in this report, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Any of the factors set forth under Risk factors may limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Annual Report, and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific factors set forth under Risk Factors in deciding whether to invest in our securities. Among these important risks are the following:\n\u25cf Since our acquisition of ComSovereign in November 2019 and considering our recent liquidity challenges, we lack an established operating history on which to evaluate our consolidated business and determine if we will be able to execute our business plan, and we can give no assurance that our operations will result in profits.\n\u25cf We incurred net losses in our fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 with negative cash flows, and we cannot assure you as to when, or if, we will become profitable and generate positive cash flows.\n\u25cf We expect to continue to incur losses from operations and negative cash flows, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u25cf We may not generate sufficient cash flows to cover our operating expenses.\n\u25cf We have significant debt and if we are unable to repay our debt when it becomes due, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\n\u25cf We have defaulted on certain debt obligations and lease obligations and if we are unable to meet our obligations when it becomes due, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\n\u25cf If we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed, our business operations will be harmed, and if we do obtain additional financing, our then-existing stockholders may suffer substantial dilution.\n\u25cf Raising capital in the future could cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\n\u25cf Pandemics may negatively affect our operations depending on the severity and longevity of the pandemic.\n\u25cf Rapid technological change in our market and/or changes in customer requirements could cause our products to become obsolete or require us to redesign our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf Product development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and our failure to develop marketable products in our various markets could adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\n\u25cf We compete with companies that have significantly more resources for their research and development efforts than we have or have received government contracts for the development of new products.\n\u25cf Product quality problems, defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\u25cf If we lose our rights to use software we currently license from third parties, we could be forced to seek alternative technology, which could increase our operating expenses and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\n\u25cf If sufficient radio spectrum is not allocated for use by our products or if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted.\n\u25cf If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could damage our business.\n\u25cf Our future profitability may depend on achieving cost reductions from increasing manufacturing quantities of our products. Failing to achieve such reductions in manufacturing costs could materially affect our business.\n\u25cf We rely primarily upon two outsourced manufacturers, one each for manufacturing FastBack radios and DragonWave radios and related components and we are exposed to the risk that these two manufacturers will not be able to satisfy our manufacturing needs on a timely basis.\n\u25cf Our potential customers for our aerostat and drone products are likely to include U.S. Government or Government-related entities that are subject to appropriations by Congress. Reduced funding for defense procurement and research and development programs would likely adversely impact our ability to generate revenues.\n\u25cf Challenging global economic conditions, ongoing geopolitical and trade uncertainty and ongoing local and regional conflicts may adversely impact the demand, cost and pricing for our products and services, as well as limit our ability to grow.\n\u25cf We may be unable to successfully integrate our recent and future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\u25cf There may be health and safety risks relating to wireless products.\n\u25cf If a successful product liability claim were made against us, our business could be seriously harmed.\n\u25cf Our tethered aerostat and drone business and operations are subject to the risks of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other natural disasters.\n\u25cf We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\n\u25cf Our common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation.\n\u25cf We have been delinquent with timely filing of our Annual Report and Quarterly Reports with the SEC and cannot assure that we will be able to timely file our reports in the future.\n\u25cf We are not in compliance with Nasdaqs listing standards and cannot assure that we will be able to comply with Nasdaqs listing standards in the future or that our common stock, warrants, and 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe lack an established operating history on which to evaluate our consolidated business and determine if we will be able to execute our business plan, and we can give no assurance that our operations will result in profits.\nWhile we have conducted our Drone Aviation business operations since 2014, we consummated the acquisition of our ComSovereign subsidiary and its various lines of business, which are diverse and involve a number of different proposed and existing product offerings, in November 2019, and a number of other operating subsidiaries since that time. As a result, we have a limited operating history as a consolidated Company upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects. Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, expenses, and difficulties associated with early-stage enterprises. You should consider an investment in our Company in light of these risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties. Such risks include:\n\u25cf the absence of an operating history in our current business and at our current scale;\n\u25cf our ability to anticipate and adapt to developing markets;\n\u25cf acceptance by customers;\n\u25cf limited marketing experience;\n\u25cf competition from competitors with substantially greater financial resources and assets;\n\u25cf our ability to provide superior customer service; and\n\u25cf reliance on key personnel.\nBecause we are subject to these risks, and the other risks discussed below, you may have a difficult time evaluating our business and your investment in our Company.\nWe incurred net losses in our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years with negative cash flows, and we cannot assure you as to when, or if, we will become profitable and generate positive cash flows.\nWe experienced net losses from operations in our fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and we may continue to incur net losses from operations in the future. Losses have historically required us to seek additional funding through the issuance of debt or equity securities. Our long-term success is dependent upon, among other things, achieving positive cash flows from operations and, if necessary, augmenting such cash flows using external resources to satisfy our cash needs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding, if needed, on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses from operations and negative cash flows, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe anticipate incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, as we can generate significant sales of our microwave radios and related products. We will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations and to develop and commercialize the technologies of our other operating subsidiaries. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of non-core assets, debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing stockholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in our ability to raise capital, we believe that there is substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flows to cover our operating expenses.\nAs noted above, we have incurred recurring losses since inception. Until we can generate significant sales of our product lines, we expect to continue to incur losses primarily as a result of costs and expenses related to research and continued development of the technologies of our operating subsidiaries and our corporate general and administrative expenses. Our operations to date have been funded primarily through sales of our debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had negative working capital of approximately $15.9 million and limited available cash. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities or raise additional funds, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.\nWe have significant debt and if we are unable to repay our debt when it becomes due, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total debt of approximately $13.5 million, excluding accrued interest. Our outstanding indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, such as:\n\u25cf limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy and other purposes;\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on our debt, which would reduce availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our ability to plan for and react to changing conditions; and\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs. If we are not able to pay our debts as they become due, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell additional debt or equity securities or sell our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell our assets, we may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe have defaulted on certain debt obligations and if we are unable to meet our obligations when it becomes due, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nCertain of our debt obligations required us to timely file periodic financial reports with the SEC. On or about April 16, 2022, we became in default of such provisions by failing to file our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021. We also failed to timely file our Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022. Those periodic reports have subsequently been filed with the SEC and the Company regained compliance with Nasdaq effective February 27, 2023.\nOn March 31, 2023, COMSovereign Holding Corp. (the Company) filed a notice of late filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to report that its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Form 10-K) would not be timely filed. We also failed to timely file our Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) stating that because the Company has not yet filed the Form 10-K, the Company is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. On May 17, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed the Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023, the Company remains not in compliance with respect to the delinquent reports. On August 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nOn October 16, 2023, the Company received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff) indicating that the Staff had determined to delist the Companys securities unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel). The Staffs determination was based upon the Companys continued non-compliance with the filing requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company has not filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. On November 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nThe Company requested and obtained a hearing before the Panel, as well as a further stay of any additional action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of a decision by the Panel. There can be no assurance that a stay will be granted or that a favorable decision will be obtained.\nIf the Company fails to timely regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule within any grace period granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, the Companys common stock, warrants and 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will be subject to delisting from Nasdaq. There is no assurance that the Company will regain compliance during any grace periods or be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to regain compliance during a grace period, Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock, warrants, and 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWe have debt obligations that we are in default on and are not timely able to satisfy.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and defaults on debt could have significant effects on our business, such as:\n\u25cf limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy and other purposes;\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt payments, which would reduce availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our ability to plan for and react to changing conditions;\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have not defaulted on lease obligations; and\n\u25cf costs associated with potential lawsuits over defaulted debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to repay our debt obligations when they become due and to meet our other cash needs. If we are not able to pay our debt obligations as they become due, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to sell additional debt or equity securities or sell our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell our assets, we may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe have defaulted on certain lease obligations and if we are unable to meet our obligations when it becomes due, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nOn February 1, 2022, we entered into a 10-year lease for 140,405 square feet of commercial space in Tucson, Arizona, and defaulted on this lease on or about March 1, 2022. In addition, at least three of our subsidiaries are in default of leases.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and default on leases could have significant effects on our business, such as:\n\u25cf limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy and other purposes;\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to make lease payments, which would reduce availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our ability to plan for and react to changing conditions;\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have not defaulted on lease obligations; and\n\u25cf costs associated with potential lawsuits over leases.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to repay our lease obligations when they become due and to meet our other cash needs. If we are not able to pay our lease obligations as they become due, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to sell additional debt or equity securities or sell our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell our assets, we may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funding when needed, our business operations will be harmed, and if we do obtain additional financing, our then-existing stockholders may suffer substantial dilution.\nAs we take steps in the commercialization and marketing of our technologies or respond to potential opportunities and/or adverse events, our working capital needs may change. We anticipate that if our cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we will require additional funding to sustain our ongoing operations and to continue our research and development activities. We do not have any contracts or commitments for additional funding, and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, if needed. The inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing to finance a revised growth plan, we will likely be required to curtail such plans or cease our business operations. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.\nRaising capital in the future could cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nIn the future, we may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration or strategic alliance arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams or product candidates on terms that are not favorable to us.\nThe occurrence of pandemics has and may still negatively affect our operations depending on the severity and longevity of the pandemic.\nA pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our goods and services but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. In addition, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the SEC. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of pandemics on our ability to obtain financing necessary to fund our working capital and other requirements. Depending on the severity and longevity of pandemics, our business, customers and stockholders has and may still experience a significant negative impact.\nRapid technological change in our market and/or changes in customer requirements could cause our products to become obsolete or require us to redesign our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, uncertain product life cycles, changing customer demands and evolving industry standards, any of which can render existing products obsolete. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to develop new and effective products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis. As a result of the complexities inherent in our products, major new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods, which may result in significant delays in the general availability of new releases or significant problems in the implementation of new releases. In addition, if we or our competitors announce or introduce new products our current or future customers may defer or cancel purchases of our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our failure to develop successfully, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products or new product enhancement that respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProduct development is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, and our failure to develop marketable products in our various markets could adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nThe development of our technologies and products, particularly for our proposed full-duplex wireless microwave products and our state-of-the-art in silicon photonic (SiP) technologies product lines, is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and the investment in product development often involves a long wait until a return, if any, is achieved on such investment. We continue to make significant investments in research and development relating to our technologies and products. Investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative. Technical obstacles and challenges we encounter in our research and development process may result in delays in or abandonment of product commercialization, substantially increase the costs of development and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe compete with companies that have significantly more resources for their research and development efforts than we have or have received government contracts for the development of new products.\nA number of our competitors have received considerable funding from government or government-related sources to develop various technologies or products. Most of these organizations and many of our other competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources and capabilities than we do. In addition, with respect to products we are developing for certain markets, we anticipate increasing competition as a result of industry consolidation, which has enabled companies to enhance their competitive position and ability to compete against us. These organizations also compete with us to:\n\u25cf attract parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations;\n\u25cf license proprietary technology that is competitive with the technology we are developing;\n\u25cf attract funding; and\n\u25cf attract and hire talented and other qualified personal.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing and commercializing products earlier than we do. Our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those we are developing and render our technology candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. If we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products and technologies, our marketing and sales will suffer, and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nSuccessful technical development of our products does not guarantee successful commercialization.\nEven if we successfully complete the technical development for one or all of our product development programs, we may still fail to develop a commercially successful product for a number of reasons, including, among others, the following:\n\u25cf lack of working capital for the purchase of parts or the costs of manufacturing;\n\u25cf failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals for their use;\n\u25cf prohibitive production costs;\n\u25cf competing products;\n\u25cf lack of innovation of the product;\n\u25cf continuing technological changes in the market rendering the product obsolete;\n\u25cf failure to scale-up our operations sufficiently to satisfy demand for our products;\n\u25cf ineffective distribution and marketing;\n\u25cf lack of sufficient cooperation from our partners; and\n\u25cf demonstrations of the products not aligning with or meeting customer needs.\nAlthough we have sold our DragonWave and FastBack radios, 5G solution, our WASP aerostat systems and various other aerostat intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and components, our success in the market for the products we develop will depend largely on our ability to prove our products capabilities. Upon demonstration, our products may not have the capabilities they were designed to have or that we believed they would have. Furthermore, even if we do successfully demonstrate our products capabilities, potential customers may be more comfortable doing business with a larger, more established, more proven company than ours. Moreover, competing products may prevent us from gaining wide market acceptance of our products. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product investments for a number of years, if at all.\nProduct quality problems, defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may experience quality control problems in our manufacturing or the manufacturing operations of our contract manufacturers. We produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies and that we believe to be state-of-the-art for our industry. Despite our testing prior to their release, our products may contain undetected defects or errors, including design, contract manufacturing or supplier quality issues, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Product defects or errors in the future could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products. In addition, undetected quality problems may prompt unexpected product returns and adversely affect warranty costs. Allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, damage our reputation in the market and with customers, and increase our warranty costs and related returns, which could negatively impact our gross margins, cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products, cause us to lose significant customers, subject us to liability for damages or divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we lose our rights to use software, we currently license from third parties, we could be forced to seek alternative technology, which could increase our operating expenses and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe license certain software used in our products from third parties, generally on a non-exclusive basis. The termination of any of these licenses, or the failure of the licensors to adequately maintain or update their software, could delay our ability to ship our products while we seek to implement alternative technology offered by other sources and could require significant unplanned investments on our part if we are forced to develop alternative technology internally. In addition, alternative technology may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms from other sources. In the future, it may be necessary or desirable to obtain other third-party licenses relating to one or more of our products or relating to current or future technologies to enhance our product offerings. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain licensing rights to the needed technology on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf sufficient radio spectrum is not allocated for use by our products or if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted.\nRadio communications are subject to significant regulation in North America, Europe, India and other jurisdictions in which we sell our products. Generally, our products must conform to a variety of national and international standards and requirements established to avoid interference among users of radio frequencies and to permit the interconnections of telecommunications equipment. In addition, our products are affected by the allocation and licensing (by auction or other means) of radio spectrum by governmental authorities. Such governmental authorities may not allocate or license sufficient radio spectrum for use by prospective customers of our products. Historically, in many developed countries, the lack of availability of commercial radio spectrum or the failure by governments to license that spectrum has inhibited the growth of wireless telecommunications networks.\nIn certain cases, in order to sell our products in any given jurisdiction, we must obtain regulatory approval for our products. Each jurisdiction in which we market our products has its own rules relating to such approval. Products that support emerging wireless telecommunications services can be marketed in a jurisdiction only if permitted by suitable radio spectrum allocations and regulations, and the process of establishing new regulations is complex and lengthy.\nAny failure by regulatory authorities to allocate suitable and sufficient radio spectrum to potential customers in a timely manner could adversely and materially impact demand for our products and may result in the delay or loss of potential orders for our products. In addition, any failure by us to obtain or maintain the proper regulatory approvals for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our resellers in certain jurisdictions to provide localized support and other local services which assist us in avoiding certain costs and investments.\nBy selling our products in certain markets through resellers, we are able to avoid certain costs relating to operating in those markets, including but not limited to local support costs, costs of maintaining a local legal entity, administration costs and logistics. If we choose or are required to sell direct in these markets (due to customer preference, termination of a reseller relationship or other reasons), the cost advantages described will no longer be available to us, which could result in an increase in our operating costs.\nIf critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could damage our business.\nWe and the contract manufacturers of our products rely on a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials and hardware components necessary to manufacture our products. We do not have any long-term agreements with any of our suppliers that obligate them to continue to sell their materials or products to us. Our reliance on these suppliers involves significant risks and uncertainties as to whether our suppliers will provide an adequate supply of required raw materials, component parts, and products. Lead-times for limited-source materials and components can be as long as twelve months, vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a component at a given time. From time to time, shortages in allocations of components have resulted in delays in filling orders. Shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future could impede our ability to meet customer orders. In addition, as the demand for these components and other products increases, it is likely that the price for these components will increase. If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to obtain the raw materials, including certain electrical components used in our products or the helium gas used in our aerostat products to provide lift, and component parts in the quantities and the quality we require on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, we may not be able to deliver our products on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could cause our customers to terminate their contracts with us, increase our costs and materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, if our suppliers or the suppliers of our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to supply the raw materials or components, we or our contract manufacturers require, we will be forced to locate alternative suppliers and possibly redesign our products to accommodate components from alternative suppliers. This would likely cause significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and could materially harm our business.\nOur dependence and exposure on component suppliers are heightened when we introduce new products. New products frequently include components that we do not use in other product lines. When we introduce new products, we must secure reliable sources of supply for those products at volumes that will be dictated by end-customer demand. Demand is often difficult to predict until the new product is better established. Constraints in our supply chain can slow the progress of new product rollouts, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future profitability may depend on achieving cost reductions from increasing manufacturing quantities of our products. Failing to achieve such reductions in manufacturing costs could materially affect our business.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing certain of our products, particularly our tethered aerostat and drone products and our DragonWave and FastBack microwave radio products, in high volumes and do not know whether or when we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture our products in large quantities while maintaining our quality, speed, price, engineering and design standards. Our inability to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We expect our suppliers to experience an increase in demand for their products, and we may not have reliable access to supplies that we require and may not be able to purchase such materials or components at cost effective prices. There is no assurance that we will obtain any material labor and machinery cost reductions associated with higher production levels, and failure to achieve these cost reductions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe rely primarily upon two outsourced manufacturers, one for manufacturing our FastBack radios and one for manufacturing DragonWave radios and related components and we are exposed to the risk that these two manufacturers will not be able to satisfy our manufacturing needs on a timely basis.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities to mass produce our FastBack and DragonWave radios and related components and we rely upon two outsourced manufacturers, SMC for FastBack and Benchmark for DragonWave, to manufacture such products. See Description of the Business - Manufacturing, Suppliers and Vendors. Our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed or interrupted as a result of a variety of factors relating to our outsourced manufacturer, including:\n\u25cf our outsourced manufacturer not being obligated to manufacture our products on a long-term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price;\n\u25cf early termination of, or failure to renew, contractual arrangements;\n\u25cf our failure to effectively manage our outsourced manufacturer relationship;\n\u25cf our outsourced manufacturer experiencing delays, disruptions, or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations;\n\u25cf lead-times for required materials and components varying significantly and being dependent on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time;\n\u25cf underestimating our requirements, resulting in our outsourced manufacturer having inadequate materials and components required to produce our products, or overestimating our requirements, resulting in charges assessed by the outsourced manufacturers or liabilities for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins;\n\u25cf the possible absence of adequate capacity and reduced control over component availability, quality assurances, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs; and\n\u25cf our outsourced manufacturer experiencing financial instability which could affect its ability to manufacture or deliver our products.\nAlthough we believe that our outsourced manufacturers have sufficient economic incentive to perform our manufacturing, the resources devoted to these activities by it are not within our control, and there can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not occur in the future. Insufficient supply or an interruption or stoppage of supply from our outsourced manufacturer or our inability to obtain additional manufacturers when and if needed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any of our outsourced manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes and quality levels, we will have to identify, qualify, select and implement acceptable alternative manufacturers, which would likely be time consuming and costly. In addition, an alternate source may not be available to us or may not be able to satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices and quality. Therefore, any significant interruption in manufacturing would result in us being unable to deliver the affected products to meet our customer orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur potential customers for our radios and our aerostat and drone products are likely to include U.S. Government or Government-related entities that are subject to appropriations by Congress. Reduced funding for defense procurement and research and development programs would likely adversely impact our ability to generate revenues.\nWe anticipate that the majority of our revenue to be derived from our aerostat product and radio product sales, at least in the foreseeable future, will come from U.S. Government and Government-related entities, including the U.S. Department of Defense and other departments and agencies. Government programs in which we may seek to participate, and contracts for tethered aerostats and drones or microwave radios, must compete with other programs for consideration during Congress budget and appropriations hearings, and may be affected by changes not only in political power and appointments but also general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. A government closure based on a failure of Congress to agree on federal appropriations or the uncertainty surrounding a continuing resolution may result in termination or delay of federal funding opportunities we are pursuing. Reductions, extensions, or terminations in a program in which we are seeking to participate, or overall defense or other spending could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and realize any profits. We cannot predict whether potential changes in security, defense, communications, and intelligence priorities will afford opportunities for our business in terms of research and development or product contracts, but any reduction in government spending on such programs could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues. In addition, our ability to participate in U.S. Government programs may be affected by the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to government contracting or changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in political or public support for security and defense programs, and uncertainties associated with the current global threat environment and other geo-political matters.\nOpportunities for expanded uses of our drone products in the United States are limited by federal laws and rulemaking.\nThe drone products we design and manufacture for use within the United States are limited by federal laws and rulemaking, including the commercial drone regulations (Part 107) adopted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA) at the end of August 2016. Our ability to design, manufacture and release new products for use in the United States will be limited by federal law and regulations, which can be slow and subject to delays based on political turnover and disruptions in federal funding, among other reasons. The Part 107 rules limit the altitude, available airspace and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote pilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. We, or our customers, may seek waivers from the Part 107 rules for expanded operations; however, the processing of waivers is lengthy and uncertain. Political limits on the ability to issue new regulations could slow the growth of the aerostat and tethered drone market.\nSome of our products may be subject to governmental regulations pertaining to exportation, which may limit the markets in which we can sell some of our products.\nInternational sales of certain of our products, including our tethered aerostat and drone products, may be subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other export laws and regulations and may be subject to first obtaining licenses, clearances or authorizations from various regulatory entities. If we are not allowed to export our products or the clearance process is burdensome, our ability to generate revenue would be adversely affected. The failure to comply with any of these regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues, as well as increase our operating costs.\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur revenues and operating results depend on the overall demand for our technologies and services. If the U.S. and worldwide economies weaken, either alone or in tandem with other factors beyond our control (including war, political unrest, pandemics, natural disasters, shifts in market demand for our services, actions by competitors or other causes), we may not be able to maintain or expand the growth of our revenue.\nSales to customers outside the United States or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in international sales.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 7% and 12%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales outside of North America. While our near-term focus is on the North American telecom and infrastructure and service market, a key element of our growth strategy is to expand our worldwide customer base and our international operations, initially through agreements with third-party resellers, distributors and other partners that can market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions. Supporting our distributors operating in international markets may require significant resources and management attention and may subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We have limited operating experience in some international markets, and we cannot assure you that our expansion efforts into other international markets will be successful. Our experience in the United States and other international markets in which we already have a presence may not be relevant to our ability to expand in other international markets. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating further demand for our products outside of the United States or in effectively selling our products in the international markets we enter. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf the need and expense to localize and adapt our products for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages, and ensuring that our products enable our customers to comply with local telecommunications industry laws and regulations, some of which are frequently changing;\n\u25cf data privacy laws which require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including employee laws and regulations;\n\u25cf different pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles, and collections issues;\n\u25cf new and different sources of competition;\n\u25cf weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u25cf compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection, and anti-bribery laws and regulations;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u25cf our ability to repatriate funds from abroad without adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf adverse tax consequences, including the potential for required withholding taxes;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency in which our foreign revenues or expenses may be denominated;\n\u25cf changes in trade relations and trade policy, including the status of trade relations between the United States and China or Russia, and the implementation of or changes to trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes;\n\u25cf public health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, including COVID-19; and\n\u25cf unstable regional and economic political conditions in the markets in which we operate.\nAny of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks, which could adversely affect our business.\nChallenging global economic conditions, ongoing geopolitical and trade uncertainty and ongoing local and regional conflicts may adversely impact the demand, cost and pricing for our products and services, as well as limit our ability to grow.\nThe challenging global economic conditions due to the pandemic, downturn in the global economy, political unrest and uncertainty, labor and supply shortages, inflation and rising interest rates, and numerous ongoing local and regional conflicts may have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products of our customers. In addition, the geopolitical risks and trade frictions, including trade restrictions, enhanced sanctions measures and increased safeguards for national security purposes, can impact global market conditions and continue to be challenging for global supply chains in general and information and communication technologies supply chains in particular. This could cause operators and other customers to postpone investments or initiate other cost-cutting measures to maintain or improve their financial position. This could also result in significantly reduced expenditures for our products and services, in which case our operating results (EBIT) would suffer. If demand for our products and services were to fall, we may experience material adverse effects on our revenues, cash flow and value of our assets and we could incur increased operating losses. Furthermore, if demand is significantly weaker or more volatile than expected, our borrowing opportunities and costs as well as the trading price of our common stock could be adversely impacted. Should global economic conditions fail to improve or should they worsen or should political unrest and uncertainty, labor and supply shortages, natural disasters, increasing inflation and rising interest rates, or geopolitical problems or trade frictions fail to improve or should they worsen, other business risks we face could intensify and could also negatively impact our business prospects of operators and other customers.\nAll of the above may have a material and potentially lasting adverse impact on our product development, supply chains, sales and operating results. Such adverse impacts may include for example:\n\u25cf Reduced demand for products and services, resulting in increased price competition or deferrals of purchases, with lower revenues not fully compensated through reduced costs;\n\u25cf Reduced or loss of sales in foreign markets;\n\u25cf Excess and obsolete inventories and excess manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf Increased trade restrictions, including economic sanctions and export controls, tariffs and increased costs that may not be recoverable;\n\u25cf Financial difficulties or failures among our suppliers;\n\u25cf Increased demand for customer finance, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable and increased risk of counter party failures;\n\u25cf Impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products;\n\u25cf Increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results;\n\u25cf Impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products;\n\u25cf Increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results; and\n\u25cf End user demand could also be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending on technology, changed operator pricing, security breaches and trust issues.\nOngoing local and regional conflicts and wars may adversely impact the demand, cost and pricing for our products and services, as well as limit our ability to grow.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, an escalation of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War conflict. In October 2023, Hamas militants infiltrated Israels southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. The intensity and duration of these regional wars is difficult to predict, and so are such wars economic implications on the Companys business and operations. To the extent that any of these negative developments do occur, they may have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and its ability to raise additional funds. As of December 31, 2022, the Company considered the impact of these regional wars on its business and operational assumptions and estimates and determined there were no material adverse impacts on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position as of December 31, 2023.\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas militants infiltrated Israels southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. The intensity and duration of Israels current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, and as are such wars economic implications on the Companys business and operations. To the extent that any of these negative developments do occur, they may have an adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and its ability to raise additional funds.\nWe intend to pursue strategic transactions in the future, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nWe intend to continue to pursue potential strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies that expand, complement, or otherwise relate to our current or future business. We also intend to consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. However, we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or other suitable partners or products or may be unable to complete acquisitions or strategic transactions on favorable terms, if at all. For example, while the historical financial and operating performance or an acquisition or joint venture partner are among the criteria, we evaluate in determining which acquisition or joint venture targets to pursue, there can be no assurance that any business or assets we acquire or contract with will continue to perform in accordance with past practices or will achieve financial or operating results that are consistent with or exceed past results. Any such failure could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, any completed acquisition or other transaction may not result in the intended benefits for other reasons and any completed acquisition or other transaction will create or involve a number of other risks such as, among others:\n\u25cf the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products;\n\u25cf additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures, and controls;\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u25cf diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or equity securities that could result in dilution to our stockholders, impact our ability to service our debt within scheduled repayment terms or include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations;\n\u25cf substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration; and\n\u25cf the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses.\nAlso, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing stockholders or result in the issuance of or assumption of debt.\nSuch acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of our Company. Any such activity may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns to us, and the resources committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions or may have to do so based on a less than optimal capital structure. Our inability to (i) take advantage of growth opportunities for our business or for our products or (ii) address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses may negatively affect our operating results. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity may materially reduce our earnings. These future acquisitions or joint ventures may not result in their anticipated benefits, and we may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations or combine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of those acquisitions.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to merge these functions, eliminate the unnecessary duplication of other functions and otherwise integrate these companies (and any additional businesses with which we may combine in the future) into a cohesive, efficient enterprise. This integration process may entail significant costs and delays could occur. Our failure to integrate the operations of these companies successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that any acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our credit and bonding capacity.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our ability to remain competitive and for the success of our products and our business. Patent protection can be limited and not all intellectual property is or can be patented. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements and procedures, non-competition agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, other proprietary rights, and our brand. We have little protection when we must rely on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees or competitors. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop technologies and products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies and/or products, which could result in decreased revenues for us. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of managements attention. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use it to enhance their products. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and financial condition and the value of our brand and other intangible assets.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to pursue the development of our technologies and products would be negatively affected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property and technologies. Some foreign countries lack rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights and do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the United States. We have numerous issued patents outside the United States, and many companies have had difficulty protecting their proprietary rights in foreign countries. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights.\nThe patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our technologies by obtaining and enforcing patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf patents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u25cf our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and license our technologies either in the United States or in international markets;\n\u25cf there may be significant pressure on the United States government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for technologies that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding security concerns;\n\u25cf countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\nMoreover, any patents issued to us may not provide us with meaningful protection, or others may challenge, circumvent, or narrow our patents. Third parties may also independently develop technologies similar to ours or design around any patents on our technologies.\nIn addition, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning software inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nOur success depends on our patents, patent applications, patents that may be licensed exclusively to us, and other patents to which we may obtain assignment or licenses. We may not be aware, however, of all patents, published applications, or published literature that may affect our business by blocking our ability to commercialize our products, preventing the patentability of products or services by us or our licensors, or covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limit the scope of our future patent claims, or adversely affect our ability to market our products and services.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information. These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technology, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have. In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.\nPatent protection and other intellectual property protection are crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase our costs and harm our ability to generate future revenue and profit.\nWe do not believe our product technologies infringe the proprietary rights of any third-party but claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common and third parties may assert infringement claims against us. It may be difficult or impossible to identify, prior to receipt of notice from a third-party, the trade secrets, patent position or other intellectual property rights of a third-party, either in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for or otherwise restrict our use of the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we are required to obtain licenses to use any third-party technology, we would have to pay royalties, which may significantly reduce any profit on our products. In addition, any such litigation could be expensive and disruptive to our ability to generate revenue or enter new market opportunities. If any of our products are found to infringe other parties proprietary rights and we are unable to come to terms regarding a license with such parties, we may be forced to modify our products to make them non-infringing or to cease production of such products altogether.\nSecurity breaches, including cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Despite the security measures we have in place and any additional measures we may implement in the future to safeguard our systems and to mitigate potential security risks, our facilities, and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches. Any such compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, loss of our customers willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe do not carry insurance against all potential risks and losses, and our insurance might be inadequate to cover all of our losses or liabilities or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe have limited, and potentially insufficient, insurance coverage for expenses and losses that may arise in connection with the quality of our products, property damage, work-related accidents and occupational illnesses, natural disasters, and environmental contamination. In addition, we have no insurance coverage for loss of profits or other losses caused by the death or incapacitation of our senior management. As a result, losses or liabilities arising from these or other such events could increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe intend to reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy limits and terms annually or when circumstances warrant from time to time. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions than we could obtain now. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to continue to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations in certain jurisdictions, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance or indemnity.\nWe develop and sell products where insurance or indemnification may not be available, including:\n\u25cf designing and developing products using advanced and unproven technologies, microwave radio technology, and tethered aerostats and drones in intelligence and homeland security applications that are intended to operate in high demand, high risk situations; and\n\u25cf designing and developing products to collect, distribute and analyze various types of information.\nFailure of certain of our products could result in loss of life or property damage. Certain products may raise questions with respect to issues of civil liberties, intellectual property, trespass, conversion, and similar concepts, which may raise new legal issues. Indemnification to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed or deployed may be available in certain circumstances, but not in others. We are not able to maintain insurance to protect against all operational risks and uncertainties. Substantial claims resulting from an accident, failure of our product, or liability arising from our products in excess of any indemnity or insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or was not obtained) could harm our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results. Any accident, even if fully covered or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively.\nThere may be health and safety risks relating to wireless products.\nOur wireless communications products emit electromagnetic radiation. In recent years, there has been publicity regarding, and increased public attention with respect to, the potentially negative direct and indirect health and safety effects of electromagnetic emissions from cellular telephones and other wireless equipment sources, including allegations that these emissions may cause cancer. Health and safety issues related to our products may arise that could lead to litigation or other actions against us or to additional regulation of our products. We may be required to modify our technology and may not be able to do so. We may also be required to pay damages that may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. Even if these concerns prove to be baseless, the resulting negative publicity could affect our ability to market our products and, in turn, could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf a successful product liability claim were made against us, our business could be seriously harmed.\nOur agreements with our customers typically, although not always, contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. Despite this, it is possible that these limitations of liability provisions may not be effective as a result of existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions. We have not experienced a material product liability claim to date; however, the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of those claims, which are likely to be substantial in light of the use of our products in critical applications. A successful product liability claim could result in significant monetary liability to us and could seriously harm our business.\nMisuse of our drone products or unmanned products manufactured by other companies could result in injury, damage and/or negative press that could depress the market for unmanned systems.\nIf any of our drone products are misused by our customers or their designees, or by the operators of other unmanned systems, in violation of the new commercial drone regulations (Part 107) adopted by the FAA or other federal, state or local regulations, such misuse could result in injuries to the operators or bystanders, damage to property and/or negative press that could result in a reduction in the market for aerostats or tethered drones in the future. The FAA, the press and the public have been closely monitoring the growth of unmanned systems in the United States. For instance, the FAA regularly publishes reports of drone sightings and reported drone strikes of manned aircraft. One or more incidents involving unmanned systems that results in injury or death of individuals, or damaged property could result in negative press that could put at risk current and future growth.\nOur tethered aerostat and drone business and operations are subject to the risks of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other natural disasters.\nThe corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations of our tethered aerostat and drone business operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida, where major hurricanes, tropical storms, and other severe weather conditions have occurred. A significant natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tropical storm, or other severe weather storm could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations for that product line, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key management, technical and sales personnel, our business would be negatively affected.\nFor our business to be successful, we need to attract and retain highly-qualified technical, management and sales personnel. The failure to recruit additional key personnel when needed with specific qualifications and on acceptable terms or to retain good relationships with our partners might impede our ability to continue to develop, commercialize and sell our products. To the extent the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting and training costs to attract and retain such employees. We have a limited number of key management, technical and sales personnel, and we rely heavily on them. The loss of any members of our management, technical or sales teams may also delay or impair achievement of our business objectives and result in business disruptions due to the time needed for their replacements to be recruited and become familiar with our business. We face competition for qualified personnel from other companies with significantly more resources available to them and thus may not be able to attract the level of personnel needed for our business to succeed.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain employees, our business would be negatively affected.\nFor our business to be successful, we need to attract and retain a sufficient number of employees. We have lost a significant number of employees in 2022. The failure to recruit and retain sufficient employees when needed with specific qualifications and on acceptable terms or to retain good relationships with our employees might impede our ability to continue to develop, commercialize and sell our products. To the extent the demand for employees exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting and training costs to attract and retain such employees. The loss of employees may also delay or impair achievement of our business objectives and result in business disruptions due to the time needed for their replacements to be recruited and become familiar with our business. We face competition for employees from other companies with significantly more resources available to them and thus may not be able to attract the level of employees for our business to succeed.\nIf we are required to reclassify independent contractors as employees, we may incur additional costs and taxes which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe engage a number of independent contractors in our operations, particularly in our research and development efforts, for whom we do not pay or withhold any federal, state or provincial employment tax. There are several different tests used in determining whether an individual is an employee, or an independent contractor and such tests generally take into account multiple factors. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change, or at least challenge, the classification of our independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified our independent contractors, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other U.S. federal or state authorities or similar authorities of a foreign government may determine that we have misclassified our independent contractors for employment tax or other purposes and, as a result, seek additional taxes from us or attempt to impose fines and penalties. If we are required to pay employer taxes or pay federal withholding with respect to prior periods with respect to or on behalf of our independent contractors, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe have historically had a small internal accounting and finance staff with limited financial accounting systems. This lack of adequate accounting resources has resulted in the identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our management team identified material weaknesses, which continued to exist as of December 31, 2022, relating to, among other matters:\n\u25cf we did not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of our accounting staff;\n\u25cf a lack of timely reconciliations of the account balances; and\n\u25cf there is a lack of documented and tested internal controls to meet the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nUpon an improvement of our liquidity challenges, we intend to take additional steps, to seek to remediate these material weaknesses and to improve our financial reporting systems and to implement new policies, procedures, and controls. If we do not successfully remediate the material weaknesses described above, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and require restatement which could result in the loss of investor confidence, delisting and/or cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to our Series A Preferred Stock\nOur Series A Preferred Stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to holders and litigation.\nIn addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, the market price of and trading volume for our Series A Preferred Stock may change for a variety of other reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance. The capital markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility. Factors that could cause the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock to fluctuate significantly include:\n\u25cf the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in operating results of us and our competitors;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors;\n\u25cf the publics reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or market opportunities in the telecommunications services and staffing industry;\n\u25cf changes in government policies in the United States and, as our international business increases, in other foreign countries;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations to meet those expectations;\n\u25cf market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u25cf any lawsuit involving us, our services or our products;\n\u25cf arrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team;\n\u25cf changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters;\n\u25cf prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf trading prices of similar securities;\n\u25cf our history of dividend payments and the suspension of dividend payments;\n\u25cf the annual yield from dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u25cf general economic and financial market conditions;\n\u25cf government action or regulation;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors in our industry; and\n\u25cf our issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities.\nAny of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our Series A Preferred Stock and could seriously harm the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding could divert our senior managements attention and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock was issued on October 27, 2021, has no stated maturity date, and does not have an established trading market, which may negatively affect its market value and your ability to transfer or sell your shares.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has been listed and trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market only since October 27, 2021, and has a limited history.\nThere is no guarantee that our Series A Preferred Stock will remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market or any other nationally recognized exchange. If our Series A Preferred Stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market or another nationally recognized exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf a determination that our Series A Preferred Stock is penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our Series A Preferred Stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our Series A Preferred Stock; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, which may negatively affect the market value of our Series A Preferred Stock and your ability to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock. No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not adversely affect the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, we may elect in the future to obtain a rating of our Series A Preferred Stock, which could adversely impact the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings and such ratings could be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nMarket interest rates and other factors may affect the value of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nOne of the factors that will influence the prices of our Series A Preferred Stock will be the dividend yield on our Series A Preferred Stock relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates could cause the market prices of our Series A Preferred Stock to go down. The trading prices of the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock will also depend on many other factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u25cf the market for similar securities;\n\u25cf government action or regulation;\n\u25cf general economic conditions or conditions in the financial markets; and\n\u25cf our financial condition, performance and prospects.\nShares of our Series A Preferred Stock are subordinate to our existing and future debt, and your interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional preferred stock, including additional shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and by other transactions.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, any classes or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to our Series A Preferred Stock as to distribution rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings. Our articles of incorporation currently authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, in one or more classes or series. In addition, a majority of our entire board of directors may, with stockholder approval, amend our articles of incorporation to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our capital stock or the number of shares of our capital stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors may, without notice to or the consent of holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, authorize the issuance and sale of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and authorize and issue additional shares of stock ranking junior to or on parity with our Series A Preferred Stock from time to time. The issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or additional shares of stock ranking on parity with our Series A Preferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to our Series A Preferred Stock (with the requisite vote of holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and other classes of stock ranking on parity with our Series A Preferred Stock as described in this prospectus supplement) or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on our Series A Preferred Stock. None of the provisions relating to our Series A Preferred Stock contain any terms relating to or limiting our indebtedness or affording the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock protection in the event of a highly-leveraged or other transaction, including a merger or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets, that might adversely affect the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, so long as the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are not materially and adversely affected.\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock have extremely limited voting rights.\nVoting rights as a holder of our Series A Preferred Stock will be extremely limited. Shares of our common stock are currently the only class of our securities carrying full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of our Series A Preferred Stock exist primarily with respect to voting on amendments to our articles of incorporation (in some cases, voting together with the holders of other parity Preferred Stock), that materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of our Series A Preferred Stock or create additional classes or series of preferred stock that are senior to our Series A Preferred Stock and the ability to elect (voting separately as a class together with the holders of all other parity Preferred Stock) two additional directors to our board of directors in the event that 18 monthly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on our Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears, which occurred on November 20, 2023.\nDividends on our Series A Preferred Stock declared by us will be authorized by our board of directors in its sole discretion out of assets legally available for distribution and will depend upon a number of factors, including our earnings, our financial condition, restrictions under applicable law, our need to comply with the terms of our existing financing arrangements, the capital requirements of our Company and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We may have to fund any declared dividends from working capital, borrow to provide funds for such dividends, or sell assets to the extent dividends exceed earnings or cash flows from operations. Funding dividends from working capital would restrict our operations. If we are required to sell assets to fund dividends, such asset sales may occur at a time or in a manner that is not consistent with our disposition strategy. If we borrow to fund dividends, our leverage ratios and future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. We suspended dividends in May 2022, and may not be able to pay dividends in the future.\nWe have suspended cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in the foreseeable future.\nOn May 25, 2022, we announced the suspension of cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to preserve cash in order to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, applicable contractual restrictions, and other such factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. Not paying monthly dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock could cause significant material adverse consequences including negatively affecting its market value and your ability to transfer or sell your shares.\nAdditionally, if dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears for 18 or more monthly periods, whether or not consecutive, which occurred on November 20, 2023, holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors, until all unpaid dividends for past dividend periods with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Preferred Stock have been paid.\nIf our common stock or our Series A Preferred Stock is delisted, your ability to transfer or sell your shares of our Series A Preferred Stock may be limited and the market value of our Series A Preferred Stock will be materially adversely affected.\nOther than in connection with certain change of control transactions, our Series A Preferred Stock does not contain provisions that protect you if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq. Since our Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, you may be forced to hold your shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and receive stated dividends on the stock when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation preference. In addition, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, it is likely that our Series A Preferred Stock will be delisted as well. Accordingly, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, your ability to transfer or sell your shares of our Series A Preferred Stock may be limited and the market value of our Series A Preferred Stock will be materially adversely affected.\nThroughout most of 2022, our common stock was not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. We were given grace periods and regained compliance on or about February 27, 2023, by having the closing bid price of our common stock exceed $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days during the grace period by implementing a 1-for-100 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock on February 10, 2023.\nOn February 27, 2023, the Company regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement (minimum bid price) price of the Companys common stock following the successful filing of its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022 pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports (filing requirements) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company filed a notice of late filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to report that its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Form 10-K) would not be timely filed. On April 18, 2023, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) stating that because the Company has not yet filed the Form 10-K, the Company is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. On May 17, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed the Form 10-K or its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (the Form 10-Q), the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. On August 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. On October 16, 2023, the Company received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff) indicating that the Staff had determined to delist the Companys securities unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel). The Staffs determination was based upon the Companys continued non-compliance with the filing requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company has not filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. On November 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nThe Company requested and obtained a hearing before the Panel as well as a further stay of any additional action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of a decision by the Panel. There can be no assurance that a favorable decision will be obtained.\nIf the Company fails to timely regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule within any grace period granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, the Companys common stock, warrants and 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will be subject to delisting from Nasdaq. There is no assurance that the Company will regain compliance during any grace periods or be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to regain compliance during a grace period, Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock, warrants, and 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn June 21, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Companys minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares, as defined by Nasdaq (MVPHS), of the Companys 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) has been below the minimum $1 million requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5555(a)(4) (the Minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares Requirement). If the Company fails to timely regain compliance with Minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares Requirement our 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will be subject to delisting from Nasdaq. Under Nasdaq rules, the Company will have the opportunity to appeal the delisting decision to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. There can be no assurance that, if the Company decides to appeal the delisting determination, such appeal would be successful.\nThere is no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to maintain compliance, our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock will be suspended and subject to delisting. If our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock were delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock and Preferred Stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws with respect to shares issued in future offerings, greater difficulty in obtaining financing, potential loss of confidence by employees, loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of Nevada law.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock is limited by the laws of Nevada. Under Nevada law, a Nevada corporation generally may not make a distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or the corporations total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the corporations charter provides otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Accordingly, we generally may not make a distribution on our Series A Preferred Stock if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless the terms of such class or series of stock provide otherwise, the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of shares of any class or series of stock then outstanding, if any, with preferential rights upon dissolution senior to those of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock Fails to Meet Nasdaqs Listing Requirement for Minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares, which may negatively affect its market value and your ability to transfer or sell your shares.\nOn June 21, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Companys minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares, as defined by Nasdaq (MVPHS), of the Companys 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) has been below the minimum $1 million requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5555(a)(4) (the Minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares Requirement).\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), the Company has been provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from receipt of the letter, or until December 18, 2023, to regain compliance with the Minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Market Value of Publicly Held Shares Requirement, the Companys Preferred Stock MVPHS must be $1 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the compliance period ending on December 18, 2023. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with either listing requirement.\nIf the Company does not regain compliance within the applicable compliance period, Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that the Preferred Stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. There can be no assurance that, if the Company decides to appeal the delisting determination, such appeal would be successful. If our Preferred Stock is delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including no market for the Preferred Stock and no ability for you to sell the Preferred Stock, reduced or no liquidity for the Preferred Stock, greater difficulty in obtaining financing, loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe may redeem our Series A Preferred Stock and you may not receive dividends that you anticipate if we do redeem our Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn or after April 29, 2024, we may, at our option, redeem our Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. Also, upon the occurrence of a certain defined change of control transactions, we may, at our option, redeem our Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurred. We may have an incentive to redeem our Series A Preferred Stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on our Series A Preferred Stock. If we redeem our Series A Preferred Stock, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.\nHolders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock should not expect us to redeem our Series A Preferred Stock on or after the date they become redeemable at our option.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock will be a perpetual equity security. This means that it will have no maturity or mandatory redemption date and will not be redeemable at the option of the holders. Our Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed by us at our option either in whole or in part, from time to time, at any time on or after April 29, 2024, or upon the occurrence of a defined change of control. Any decision we may make at any time to propose a redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock will depend upon, among other things, our evaluation of our capital position, the composition of our stockholders equity and general market conditions at that time.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of our common stock, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of our common stock increases.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of our common stock and earns dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock. The market value of our Series A Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, our Series A Preferred Stock.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors and litigation.\nIn addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, the market price of and trading volume for our common stock may change for a variety of other reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance. The capital markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include:\n\u25cf the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors;\n\u25cf the publics reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or market opportunities in the telecommunications services and staffing industry;\n\u25cf changes in government policies in the United States and, as our international business increases, in other foreign countries;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations to meet those expectations;\n\u25cf market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u25cf any lawsuit and judgments involving us, our services or our products;\n\u25cf arrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of common stock by us, our investors, or members of our management team; and\n\u25cf changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\nAny of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our common stock and could seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. This may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of our common stock, if at all. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding could divert our senior managements attention and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, applicable contractual restrictions, and other such factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through common stock offerings. Our executive officers and directors beneficially own, collectively, a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock. If one or more of them were to sell a substantial portion of the shares they hold, it could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with Nasdaqs listing standards.\nOur common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq on January 22, 2021. To be so listed, we were required to meet the current Nasdaq listing standards, including the minimum bid price requirement, which we met by implementing a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock on January 21, 2021, and which we met by implementing a 1-for-100 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock on February 10, 2023. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will remain at the level required for continuing compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of Nasdaq. It is not uncommon for the market price of a companys common stock to decline in the period following a reverse stock split. If the market price of our common stock declines, given our recent reverse stock splits, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of such reverse stock splits. In addition, other factors unrelated to the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as negative financial or operational results, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and jeopardize our ability to meet or maintain Nasdaqs minimum bid price requirement. If we fail to comply with the minimum bid price requirement, there could be further reverse stock splits, and our securities could be delisted.\nOur stock price may fail to meet in the future the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In 2022 and 2023, we were late with our Annual Report and Quarterly Reports with the SEC. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThroughout most of 2022, our common stock was not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement. We were given grace periods and regained compliance on or about February 27, 2023, by having the closing bid price of our common stock exceed $1.00 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days during the grace period by implementing a 1-for-100 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock on February 10, 2023. If our common stock falls below the minimum closing bid price requirement, there could be further reverse stock splits.\nIn April 2022, we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. We regained compliance on or about February 24, 2023, by filing the last of our later periodic financial reports.\nHowever, in April 2023, we were not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. We must regain compliance on or about October 12, 2023, by filing the annual report on Form 10-K and later periodic financial reports. On March 31, 2023, the Company filed a notice of late filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to report that its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Form 10-K) would not be timely filed. On April 18, 2023, the Company received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) stating that because the Company has not yet filed the Form 10-K, the Company is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. On May 17, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed the Form 10-K or its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (the Form 10-Q), the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. On August 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. On October 16, 2023, the Company received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff) indicating that the Staff had determined to delist the Companys securities unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel). The Staffs determination was based upon the Companys continued non-compliance with the filing requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company has not filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. On November 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because the Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nThe Company requested and obtained a hearing before the Panel as well as a further stay of any additional action by Nasdaq pending the issuance of a decision by the Panel. There can be no assurance that a favorable decision will be obtained. See Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Nasdaq Compliance Developments in the accompanying Notes of the financial statements for additional information.\nThere is no assurance, however, that we will be able to regain compliance or maintain compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to regain compliance or maintain compliance, our common stock, warrants, and 9.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock will be suspended and subject to delisting.\nIf our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws with respect to shares issued in future offerings, greater difficulty in obtaining financing, potential loss of confidence by employees, loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we could attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaqs listing requirements.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future. Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when or as we require. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, our existing stockholders will experience further dilution and could trigger anti-dilution provisions in outstanding warrants.\nWe need to raise additional capital in the future. Future financings may involve the issuance of debt, equity and/or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities. These financings may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all when and as we require funding. If we are able to consummate such financings, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected and/or the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. Any failure to obtain additional working capital when required would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and may result in a decline in our stock price. Any issuances of our common stock, convertible preferred stock, or securities such as warrants or notes that are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, our capital stock, would have a dilutive effect on the voting and economic interest of our existing stockholders.\nOur officers and directors are entitled to indemnification from us for liabilities under our articles of incorporation, which could be costly to us and may discourage the exercise of stockholder rights.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that we possess and may exercise all powers of indemnification of our officers, directors, employees, agents and other persons and our bylaws also require us to indemnify our officers and directors as permitted under the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS). We also have contractual indemnification obligations under our agreements with our directors and officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our Company from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers, and employees for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors, officers and employees even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our Company and stockholders.\nOur bylaws and Nevada law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our management, which could have the result of depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of Nevada law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third-party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition arguably could benefit our stockholders.\nNevadas combinations with interested stockholders statutes, NRS 78.411 through 78.444, inclusive, prohibit specified types of business combinations between certain Nevada corporations and any person deemed to be an interested stockholder for two years after such person first becomes an interested stockholder unless the corporations board of directors approves the combination, or the transaction by which such person becomes an interested stockholder, in advance, or unless the combination is approved by the board of directors and sixty percent of the corporations voting power not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder, its affiliates and associates. Further, in the absence of prior approval certain restrictions may apply even after such two-year period. However, these statutes do not apply to any combination of a corporation and an interested stockholder after the expiration of four years after the person first became an interested stockholder. For purposes of these statutes, an interested stockholder is any person who is (1) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (2) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term combination is sufficiently broad to cover most significant transactions between a corporation and an interested stockholder. These statutes generally apply to Nevada corporations with 200 or more stockholders of record. However, a Nevada corporation may elect in its articles of incorporation not to be governed by these particular laws, but if such election is not made in the corporations original articles of incorporation, the amendment (1) must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock representing a majority of the outstanding voting power of the corporation not beneficially owned by interested stockholders or their affiliates and associates, and (2) is not effective until 18 months after the vote approving the amendment and does not apply to any combination with a person who first became an interested stockholder on or before the effective date of the amendment. We did not make such an election in our original articles of incorporation and have not amended our articles of incorporation to so elect.\nNevadas acquisition of controlling interest statutes, NRS 78.378 through 78.3793, inclusive, contain provisions governing the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations. These control share laws provide generally that any person that acquires a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations may be denied voting rights, unless a majority of the disinterested stockholders of the corporation elects to restore such voting rights. Our bylaws provide that these statutes do not apply to us or any acquisition of our common stock. Absent such provision in our bylaws, these laws would apply to us as of a particular date if we were to have 200 or more stockholders of record (at least 100 of whom have addresses in Nevada appearing on our stock ledger at all times during the 90 days immediately preceding that date) and do business in the State of Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation, unless our articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the tenth day after the acquisition of a controlling interest provide otherwise. These laws provide that a person acquires a controlling interest whenever a person acquires shares of a subject corporation that, but for the application of these provisions of the NRS, would enable that person to exercise (1) one fifth or more, but less than one third, (2) one third or more, but less than a majority or (3) a majority or more, of all of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors. Once an acquirer cross one of these thresholds, shares which it acquired in the transaction taking it over the threshold and within the 90 days immediately preceding the date when the acquiring person acquired or offered to acquire a controlling interest become control shares to which the voting restrictions described above apply.\nVarious provisions of our bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt of us that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest. Our bylaws may be adopted, amended, or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, and except as provided by Nevada law, our board of directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws by a vote of not less than a majority of our directors. The interests of these stockholders and directors may not be consistent with your interests, and they may make changes to the bylaws that are not in line with your concerns.\nNevada law also provides that directors may resist a change or potential change in control if the directors determine that the change is opposed to, or not in the best interests of, the corporation. The existence of the foregoing provisions and other potential anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our common stock will likely decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts, over whom we have no control, publish about us and our business. We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our Company, the market price for our common stock could decline. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue unfavorable commentary, even if it is inaccurate, or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nOur articles of incorporation allow for our board of directors to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of our preferred stock. Currently our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue up to 100,000,000 shares of our blank check preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item 1B. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n\u25cf Our principal executive offices were in Dallas, Texas comprising an aggregate of approximately 15,289 square feet leased by ComSovereign. These premises were vacated and the lease was abandoned by ComSovereign in June of 2022. As a result of the lease abandonment, ComSovereign may face legal claims or proceedings for damages regarding that lease, in an unknown amount.\n\u25cf On January 29, 2021, we completed the acquisition of a 140,000-square-foot building on 12.7 acres in Tucson, Arizona (the Tucson Building) for a purchase price of approximately $6.1 million, of which approximately $2.2 million was paid in cash and the balance was paid with the net proceeds of a $5.3 million term loan that matured in January 2022. On January 31, 2022, we completed the sale of the Tucson Building and repaid the outstanding term loan. On February 1, 2022, we entered into a 10-year lease agreement for the Tucson Building and provided a security deposit of $1.0 million. However, we defaulted on this lease on or about March 1, 2022, and vacated the premises in May of 2022. As a result of the lease abandonment, we may face legal claims or proceedings for damages regarding that lease, in an unknown amount.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries lease various property:\n\u25cf Jacksonville, Florida (Drone Aviation Executive Offices); and\n\u25cf Holly Hill, Florida (Drone Aviation Manufacturing Facility).\nOther former properties:\n\u25cf Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (DragonWave). This lease was assumed by Syntronic Production LLC as a result of the sale of the DragonWave-X Cananda, Inc. asset;\n\u25cf Chantilly, Virginia (VNC). These premises were vacated and this lease was abandoned in July of 2022. As a result of the lease abandonment, the landlord obtained a default judgment against us in the amount of approximately $230,000;\n\u25cf San Diego, California (VEO). These premises were vacated and this lease was abandoned in June of 2022. As a result of the lease abandonment, we may face legal claims or proceedings for damages regarding that lease, in an unknown amount;\n\u25cf Colorado Springs, Colorado (Sovereign Plastics). This lease was transferred with the sale of Sovereign Plastics in June of 2022; and\n\u25cf Yokneam, Israel (SKS). This lease was transferred with the sale of SKS in March of 2023.\nWe believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current requirements. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Neither our Company nor any of our subsidiaries currently is a party to any legal proceeding that, individually or in the aggregate, is material to our Company as a whole, except as follows.\nOn January 27, 2022, a former employee filed suit against our Company in the Tulsa County Oklahoma District Court, Case No. CJ-2022-00221. The plaintiff has alleged that she was entitled to six months of severance pay after her employment contract was not renewed, and that her option agreements did not expire 30 days after cessation of her employment, and claims she is owed approximately $75,000 in severance and $250,000 in damages for her options. The Company filed an answer to the complaint and the proceedings are currently in the discovery phase. We dispute plaintiffs allegations and we intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company entered into a 10-year lease for 140,405 square feet of commercial space in Tucson, Arizona, and defaulted on this lease on or about March 1, 2022. In addition, two of our subsidiaries are in default of their office leases. As a result of these lease defaults, the Company and respective subsidiaries may face legal claims or proceedings for damages regarding that lease, in an unknown amount.\nOn June 16, 2022, the Company received notice from certain former shareholders of SAGUNA claiming breaches of the SAGUNA stock purchase agreement and claiming that all of the former shareholders of SAGUNA have suffered damages totaling approximately $13.9 million, which they calculated as the value related to the consideration issued to those former shareholders for the acquisition of SAGUNA. The Company denies those claims and has not accrued any contingent loss. However, the Company may face legal claims or proceedings regarding those claims.\nBy notice dated July 14, 2022, the Company received notice from a distributor that has a distribution agreement with InduraPower claiming that InduraPower, and the Company as guarantor, has breached the distribution agreement, and are claiming approximately $2.0 million in damages, which includes a claim for $0.5 million of foregone profit. The Company had received $1.3 million in cash as a deposit against future product deliveries which is included in contract liabilities - current. In addition, the Company fully accrued the remaining claim of $0.7 million in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nOn or about July 17, 2022, the former employees of SKS filed an insolvency request against SKS in the Nazareth District Court, Israel, No. 35035-06-22. The action represents $400,000 of claims of the former employees, which were fully accrued as of September 30, 2022. The claims of the former employees were resolved pursuant to the SKS Sale Agreement and the action was dismissed on or about January 9, 2023.\nOn or about July 28, 2022, a former employee filed suit against the Company, Dustin McIntire, and Daniel Hodges in the San Diego County California Superior Court, Case No. 37-2022-00028083-CU-BC-CTL (RVI Claim #1). The plaintiff alleged that his wages were not paid, that he was constructively discharged, that the Company failed to issue him stock options, and that he is owed future amounts, and claimed total damages of no less than $238,000. On December 29, 2022, the Company resolved this lawsuit.\nOn or about August 22, 2022, two former FastBack employees filed suit against the Company, DragonWave and FastBack in the Alameda County Superior Court, California, Case No. 22CV016666. The plaintiffs allege that their payroll was late and that the Company failed to make one payroll, failed to timely pay wages three times, failed to pay accrued vacation time, and owes penalties under California law. Each plaintiff claimed damages of no less than $66,500. The Company has accrued for the wage claims for services provided but has not accrued for penalties. On April 4, 2023, the Company resolved this lawsuit.\nOn or about August 23, 2022, a former employee filed suit against the Company in the Clark County District Court, Nevada, Case No. 3 A-22-857361-C (RVI Claim #2). The plaintiff alleged that his wages were not paid, that he was constructively discharged, that the Company failed to issue him stock options, and that he is owed future amounts and claimed total damages of no less than $184,000. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had accrued for the wage claims for services provided of $8,000 but had not accrued for the claims associated with future services. On December 29, 2022, the Company resolved this lawsuit.\nOn or about September 20, 2022, the Company was served with a suit that was filed on or about May 27, 2022 by the holder of a Transform-X Inc. (Transform-X) promissory note, suing the Company, Daniel Hodges, and Transform-X in the Richland County Court of Common Pleas, South Carolina, Case No. 2022CP4002806. The plaintiff alleges that for $125,000 he purchased an 8% promissory note in 2018 from Transform-X which has not been paid.

We have assembled a portfolio of communications and portable infrastructure technologies, and solutions that enable the upgrading of legacy 3G, 4G and 4G-LTE networks and can facilitate the rapid roll out of the 5G and 6G networks of the future. Our hardware solutions are complemented by a broad array of services, including mobile edge compute, configuration management, technical support, systems design and integration, and sophisticated research and development programs. We compete globally with innovative technology, an array of cost-effective solutions and customer service supporting a global customer base with a focus on the North American telecom infrastructure and service market.\nWe design, develop, market and sell products and solutions for telecom network operators, mobile device carriers and other enterprises, including the following:\n\u25cf Wireless Transport Solutions. We offer a line of high-capacity packet microwave solutions that drive next-generation intellectual property (IP) networks. Our carrier-grade point-to-point packet microwave systems transmit broadband voice, video and data. Our solutions enable service providers, government agencies, enterprises and other organizations to meet their increasing bandwidth requirements rapidly and affordably. The principal application of our product portfolio is wireless network transport, including a range of products ideally suited to support the emergence of underlying small cell networks. Additional solutions include leased-line replacement, last mile fiber extension and enterprise networks.\n\u25cf Edge Compute Capable 4G LTE and 5G Network in a Box. We offer both 4G/LTE and 5G New Radio (NR) based Network in a Box capable of connecting to other access radios or directly to mobile devices such as mobile phones and other Internet-of-things devices. The all-in-one mobile networks support edge-based application hosting and enable third-party service integration.\n\u25cf Tethered Drones and Aerostats. We design, manufacture, sell and provide logistical services for specialized tethered aerial monitoring and communications platforms serving national defense and security customers for use in applications such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and tactical communications. We focus primarily on a suite of tethered aerostats known as the Winch Aerostat Small Platform, which are principally designed for military and security applications and provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high-strength armored tether. Our recently-acquired HoverMast line of quadrotor-tethered drones feature uninterruptible ground-based power, fiber optic communications for cyber immunity, and the ability to operate in GPS-denied environments while delivering dramatically-improved situational awareness and communications capabilities to users.\nWe are also developing processes that we believe will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in silicon photonic (SiP) devices for use in advanced data interconnects, communication networks and computing systems. We believe our novel approach will allow us to overcome the limitations of current SiP optical modulators, dramatically increase computing bandwidth, and reduce drive power while offering lower operating costs. In addition, we are seeking to leverage our AI capabilities in our Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) unlicensed radio enhancing and extending these capabilities to further support our customers environments while expanding and extending our footprint of AI capabilities through new partnerships.\nOur engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale application-specific integrated circuit design and verification, SiP design and integration, system software development, hardware design, high-speed electronics design and network planning, installation, maintenance, and servicing. We believe this broad expertise in a wide range of advanced technologies, methodologies, and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce future-generation communications and computing technologies. In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.\nCorporate History\nWe were incorporated in Nevada on April 17, 2014, as a wholly owned subsidiary of MacroSolve, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (MacroSolve), and effective April 30, 2014, in order to consolidate our operations into an entity incorporated in Nevada, MacroSolve merged with and into us. On June 3, 2014, we acquired Drone Aviation Corp. through a stock exchange transaction, and on March 26, 2015, Drone Aviation Corp. merged with and into us. As a result of the stock exchange and merger with Drone Aviation Corp., we acquired Drone Aviation Corp.s subsidiary, Lighter Than Air Systems Corp., which does business under the name Drone Aviation.\nBetween 2019 to 2022, we completed various acquisitions and mergers including the following businesses: ComSovereign, VEO, InduraPower, Silver Bullet, DragonWave, Lextrum, Sovereign Plastics, VNC, FastBack, Sky Sapience, RVision, Innovation Digital, RF Engineering, and Saguna. Commencing in 2022, as a result of our liquidity challenges, we embarked on a significant reduction of overhead and personnel costs through the divestment of non-core assets in favor of a refocus on our true core competencies in 5G and beyond technology which resulted in numerous lease abandonments and idling of several businesses including VEO, InduraPower, Silver Bullet, DragonWave, RF Engineering, and Saguna (see Note 20 - Business Acquisitions for additional information).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed the sales of Sovereign Plastics and RVision for total consideration of $2.0 million. See Note 3 - Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale and Note 20 - Business Acquisitions discussed in the Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn December 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell SKS. The sale of SKS was completed during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (see Note 3 - Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale and Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Business Developments for additional information).\nDuring 2022, the Company operated with multiple reporting units and began to centralize operations. At January 1, 2023, the Company shifted and began operating as a single reporting unit (see Reportable Segments and Reporting Units below).\nPrinciple of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.\nReportable Segments and Reporting Units\nA reporting unit (RU) is a component of an operating segment that is a business activity for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Companys legal operating subsidiaries are not organized to qualify as individual segments, however, each operating entity had separate financial information and an operating manager, who oversees the business and financial activities, reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). Therefore, during 2022, the Company operates as one reportable segment and each legal entity is deemed to be a separate reporting unit. As of January 1, 2023, the Company began operating as a single reporting unit.\nSignificant Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nOur revenues are generated primarily from the sale of our products, which consist primarily of telecom hardware, repairs, support & maintenance, drones, consulting, warranties and other. At contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in the contract with customers and identify a performance obligation for each. To determine the performance obligation, we consider all products and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods and services. We generally recognize product revenues at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 7% and 12%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the United States. While our near-term focus is on the North American telecom and infrastructure and service market, a key element of our growth strategy is to expand our worldwide customer base and our international operations, initially through agreements with third-party resellers, distributors and other partners that can market and sell our products in foreign jurisdictions. We expect that as our liquidity improves, our percentage of sales outside the United States may increase as we build up our domestic sales and service teams. Notwithstanding such percentage increase, we expect the sales of tethered aerostats and drones will primarily be to the domestic market customers, primarily to the U.S. government and its agencies, even if such systems are for integration into foreign locations.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit\nOur cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of the costs of manufacturing products, procuring finished goods from our third-party manufacturers, third-party logistics and warehousing provider costs, shipping and handling costs and warranty costs. We presently outsource the manufacturing of our FastBack and DragonWave products to two outsourced manufacturers, SMC for FastBack products and Benchmark for DragonWave products. Cost of goods sold also includes costs associated with supply operations, including personnel-related costs, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, third-party license costs and third-party costs related to the services we provide. Additionally, cost of goods sold does not include any depreciation and amortization expenses as we separate depreciation and amortization expense into its own category within operating expenses.\nGross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including changes in our supply chain and evolving product mix. The margin profile of our current products and future products will vary depending on operating performance, features, materials, manufacturer, and supply chain. Gross margin will vary as a function of product mix, changes in pricing due to competitive pressure, our third-party manufacturing, our production costs, costs of shipping and logistics, provision for excess and obsolete inventory and other factors. We expect our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expense as research and development, sales, and marketing, and general and administrative. Personnel costs are the primary component of each of these operating expense categories, which consist of cash-based personnel costs, such as salaries, sales commissions, benefits, and bonuses. Additionally, we separate depreciation and amortization expense into its own category.\nResearch and Development\nIn addition to personnel-related costs, research and development expense consists of costs associated with the design, development, and certification of our products. We generally recognize research and development expense as incurred. Development costs incurred prior to establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nIn addition to personnel costs for sales, marketing, service and product management personnel, sales and marketing expense consists of the expenses associated with our training programs, trade shows, marketing programs, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, national and local regulatory approvals of our products, travel, entertainment and recruiting. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales, marketing, service, and product management organization in support of our investment in our growth opportunities, whether through the development and rollout of new or modified products or through acquisitions and partnerships.\nGeneral and Administrative\nIn addition to personnel costs, general and administrative expense consists of professional fees, such as legal, audit, accounting, information technology and consulting fees; share-based compensation; and facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation related to fixed assets such as test equipment, research and development equipment, computer hardware, production fixtures and leasehold improvements, as well as amortization related to definite-lived intangibles.\nImpairment\nWe account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.\nLoss on Sales\nA gain or loss on sales is recognized on sales of long-lived assets and included in income from continuing operations in the income statement. The amount of consideration promised in a contract that is included in the calculation of a gain or loss includes both the transaction price and the carrying amount of liabilities assumed.\nLoss on Lease Abandonment\nA loss on lease abandonment is recognized upon the derecognition of an ROU asset and evaluation that impairment is necessary in accordance with ASC 842. A gain or loss is recognized from the difference between the carrying amount of the ROU asset and the lease liability.\nGain on the Sale of Assets\nA gain or loss is recognized on the sale and leaseback of long-lived assets and included in income from continuing operations in the income statement. The amount of consideration promised in a contract that is included in the calculation of a gain or loss includes the transaction price and the carrying amount of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and closing costs.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is comprised of interest expense associated with our secured notes payable, notes payable and senior convertible debentures. The amortization of debt discounts is also recorded as part of interest expense.\nResults of Operations\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nRevenue $ 9,878 $ 9,064\nCost of goods sold 7,594 4,582\nGross profit 2,284 4,482\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development (1) 2,354 4,044\nSales and marketing (1)\nGeneral and administrative (1) 17,778 24,938\nDepreciation and amortization 2,008 14,078\nImpairment 41,439 106,055\nLoss on sales (ID, DWXC, RVI) (2) 2,713 -\nLoss on lease abandonment 13,560 -\nGain on the sale of assets (8,441 ) (83 )\nTotal operating expenses, net 71,460 149,647\nLoss from operations (69,176 ) (145,165 )\nOther expense\nInterest expense (3,978 ) (2,797 )\nOther expense - (116 )\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (7,306 ) (4,356 )\nForeign currency transaction gain -\nTotal other expense (11,284 ) (7,221 )\nLoss from continuing operations (80,460 ) (152,386 )\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (663 )\nNet loss $ (79,713 ) $ (153,049 )\n(1) These are exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n(2) Innovation Digital (ID), DragonWave-X Canada (DWXC), RVision (RVI)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nTotal Revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, total revenues increased $0.8 million, or 9%, which was primarily related to sales of our aerostat products and accessories, partially offset by a decrease in our mobile network backhaul products.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cost of goods sold increased $3.0 million, or 66%, which primarily was due to a one-time sale of $1.8 million of DragonWave inventory for proceeds of $0.2 million for a loss of $1.6 million due to the challenges related to the Companys liquidity.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased $2.3 million with a gross profit margin of 22% compared to 49% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in gross profit margin resulted primarily due to the one-time sale of DragonWave inventory and sales of products that were lower margin compared to fiscal year 2021 and increases in purchase price variances due to increased prices from manufacturing and logistical suppliers as a result of then macro supply chain constraints.\nResearch and Development Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, research and development expenses decreased $1.7 million, or 42%. This was driven by decreases in contract labor and payroll-related costs. This decrease was driven by liquidity challenges and getting rid of discretionary expenditures including reduced developments of DragonWave radio software features, VNC system product development and VEO photonics chip development.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.6 million, or 92%, which primarily consisted of decreases in payroll and related costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.2 million, or 29%, primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs of $6.5 million and professional expenses consisting of certain public relations services and accounting services and other professional services of $1.8 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization decreased $12.1 million, or 86%, due to the sale of the Tucson building in January 2022, sales of subsidiaries and assets lost in the abandonment of leases described below in the Loss on Lease Abandonment section of this discussion.\nImpairment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment expense was $41.4 million, primarily due to goodwill impairment of $29.3 million and intangibles impairment of $12.1 million, compared to $106.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to goodwill of $62.4 million and intangibles of $43.7 million. Our unfavorable liquidity situation and decline in market capitalization resulted in significant impairments of our intangibles and goodwill.\nLoss on Sales of Innovation Digital, DragonWave-X Canada, and RVision\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the loss on the sales of Innovation Digital, DragonWave-X Canada, and RVision assets was $2.7 million. The loss is primarily due to the transfer of $2.2 million of inventory to the purchaser of the DragonWave-X Canada assets and $0.6 million of intellectual property returned to the original owners of Innovation Digital.\nLoss on Lease Abandonment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the loss on lease abandonment was $13.6 million, which primarily consisted of $10.0 million related to the abandonment of the Tucson Building lease and related leasehold improvements and inventory, $1.4 million related to the derecognition of the RF Engineering lease, property and equipment, and inventory controlled by the owners of the Company, $1.0 million related to the abandonment of the Dallas Texas office space and related leasehold improvements, $0.3 million related to the abandonment of the Chantilly Virginia lease and related leasehold improvements, property and equipment, and inventory, $0.2 million related to the abandonment of the San Diego California lease, and $0.2 million related to the return of various pieces of operating lease equipment and abandonment of small offices.\nGain on the Sale of Assets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the gain on the sale of assets was $8.4 million compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $8.3 million is due to the January 31, 2022 sale of our Tucson Building for $15.8 million of cash, partially offset by the carrying value of $6.7 million and related transaction costs of $0.7 million.\nOther Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, other expense was $11.3 million compared to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of $4.2 million is primarily due to an increase in the loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.0 million and an increase in interest expense of $1.2 million.\nLoss from Continuing Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $80.5 million compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $152.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to the items described above.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income from discontinued operations of $0.7 million as a result of the gain on sale of Sovereign Plastics compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet Loss\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of $79.7 million compared to a net loss of $153.0 million for the period December 31, 2021, related to the items described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its cash requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.9 million in cash compared to $1.9 million on December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $15.9 million compared to a working capital deficit of $3.6 million as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had undiscounted obligations relating to the payment of indebtedness as follows:\n\u25cf $11.6 million related to indebtedness that is due during 2023; and\n\u25cf $0.6 million related to indebtedness that is due during 2024; and\n\u25cf $1.3 million related to indebtedness that is due after 2027.\nOur future capital requirements for our operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of our businesses, and the costs of our operations. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current stockholders ownership and could also result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs.\nOur future capital requirements for our operations will depend on many factors, including the profitability of our businesses, the number and cash requirements of other acquisition candidates that we pursue, and the costs of our operations. We have been investing in research and development in anticipation of increasing revenue opportunities in our cellular network solutions business, which has contributed to our losses from operations.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we used cash flows in operating activities of $9.5 million, and at December 31, 2022 we had an accumulated deficit of $297.6 million and we had working capital deficit of $15.9 million.\nOur fiscal operating results, accumulated deficit and negative working capital, among other factors, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current cash on hand and subsequent activity as described herein, we presently only have enough cash on hand to operate on a month-to-month basis, without raising additional capital or selling assets. Because of our limited cash availability, our operations have been scaled back to the extent possible. We continue to explore opportunities with third parties and related parties to provide additional capital; however, we have not entered into any agreement to provide the necessary capital. In the near term, there will be limited opportunities to raise capital of significance until our Nasdaq compliance issues are resolved, in the Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report (see Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Nasdaq Compliance Developments for additional information).\nWe will continue to pursue the actions outlined above, as well as work towards increasing revenue and operating cash flows to meet our future liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any capital-raising efforts that we may undertake, and these planned actions do not alleviate the substantial doubt. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to further delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately, we could be forced to discontinue operations, liquidate assets and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.\nDebt Agreements\nSummary information with respect to our debt or other credit facilities is set forth in Note 14 - Debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\nCash flows used in operating activities $ (9,529 ) $ (39,089 )\nCash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 14,937 (9,440 )\nCash flows (used in) provided by financing activities (6,502 ) 52,354\nCash flows provided by (used in) discontinued operations 1,632 (2,665 )\nNet cash used in assets held for sale (543 ) -\nEffect of exchange rates on cash -\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (5 ) $ 1,183\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $9.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of the net loss from continuing operations of $80.5 million, which was offset by adjustments for non-cash expenses of $64.2 million and net cash generated by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities of $6.7 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $39.1 million. Net cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of the net loss from continuing operations of $152.4 million, which was offset by adjustments for non-cash expenses of $129.3 million and net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities of $15.3 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by investing activities was $14.9 million. Investing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from the building sale of $15.1 million, which was partially offset by the acquisition of property and equipment of $0.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $9.4 million. Investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisition of the net assets of FastBack, RVision, Innovation Digital, RF Engineering and SAGUNA, which used $6.5 million of net cash, the acquisition of property and equipment of $3.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment of $0.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $6.5 million. Financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of debt of $7.5 million and preferred stock dividends paid of $0.2 million, partially offset by $1.3 million of proceeds of debt issued.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, financing activities provided cash of $52.4 million. Financing activities primarily consisted of $45.0 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock from an offering, $14.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt, and $8.0 million of proceeds from the sale of preferred stock, which was offset by $7.6 million for repayment of debts, $6.1 million for offering costs, $1.0 million for repayment of related party notes, and $0.2 million for payment of preferred stock dividends.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for our evaluation of accounting standards not yet adopted.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes. In preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. Preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nBesides estimates that meet the critical accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem critical.\nAccounts Receivable and Credit Policies\nTrade accounts receivable consist of amounts due from the sale of our products and services. Such accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 to 45 days of receipt of the invoice. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022, we characterized $1.2 million as uncollectible.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nThe determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessments of factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition. Significant management inputs used in the estimation of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, future changes in technology, estimated replacement costs, discount rates, and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the Companys product portfolio. Where appropriate, external advisers are consulted to assist in the determination of fair value. For non-observable market values, fair value has been determined using acceptable valuation methods (e.g., relief from royalty methods). The results of operations for businesses acquired are included in the financial statements from the acquisition date.\nAcquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition integration costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the fair value of acquired intangible assets, an indemnification asset related to certain assumed liabilities, net lease liabilities, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances, and pre-acquisition contingencies with a corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBeneficial Conversion Features and Warrants\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated the conversion feature of convertible debt instruments to determine whether the conversion feature was beneficial as described in ASC 470-30, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature (BCF) related to the issuance of convertible debt that had conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued and recorded the relative fair value of any warrants issued with those instruments. The BCF for the convertible instruments was recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features, both of which were credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company calculated the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible instruments using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nUnder these guidelines, the Company first allocates the value of the proceeds received from a convertible debt transaction between the convertible debt instrument and any other detachable instruments included in the transaction (such as warrants) on a relative fair value basis. A BCF is then measured as the intrinsic value of the conversion option at the commitment date, representing the difference between the effective conversion price and the Companys stock price on the commitment date multiplied by the number of shares into which the debt instrument is convertible. The allocated value of the BCF and warrants are recorded as a debt discount and accreted over the expected term of the convertible debt as interest expense. If the intrinsic value of the BCF is greater than the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt instrument, the amount of the discount assigned to the BCF is limited to the amount of the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt instrument.\nBeginning on January 1, 2022, with the adoption of ASU 2020-06, it was no longer necessary to evaluate whether a conversion feature was beneficial.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nAfter the adoption of ASU 2020-06-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity, on April 1, 2022, the Company accounts for its convertible debt as a single liability with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The Company accounts for privately negotiated settlements of its convertible debt as induced conversions, resulting in an inducement loss measured as the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the original terms of the instrument on the acceptance date. The remaining consideration transferred, after reducing the carrying amount of the convertible debt, is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Prior to conversion of its convertible debt, the Company includes, in the diluted net income per common share calculation, the effect of the additional shares that may be issued when the Companys common stock price exceeds the conversion price using the if-converted method. The Companys convertible debt has no impact on diluted net income per common share unless the average price of the Companys common stock exceeds the conversion price because the Company is required to settle the principal amount of the convertible debt in cash upon conversion.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separately accounted for the liability and equity components of its convertible debt by estimating the fair values of the i) liability component without a conversion feature and ii) the conversion feature. This resulted in a bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the Companys consolidated statements of income. Upon settlement of convertible debt instruments, the Company allocated the total consideration between the liability and equity components based on the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature. The difference between the consideration allocated to the liability component and the net carrying value of the liability component was recognized as an extinguishment loss or gain. The remaining settlement consideration was allocated to the equity component and recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. In addition, if the terms of the settlement were different from the contractual terms of the original instrument, the Company recognized an inducement loss, which was measured as the difference between the fair value of the original terms of the instrument and the fair value of the settlement terms. The Company included the dilutive effect of the shares of its common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debt under the treasury stock method as it had the intent and had adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of its convertible debt in cash. This method resulted in incremental dilutive shares when the average price of the Companys common stock for a reporting period exceeded the conversion prices per share.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and requires entities to recognize revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The principles in the standard are applied in five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We adopted Topic 606 as of January 10, 2019 (date of inception).\nOur revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five-step framework. Understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time, amount and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires judgment. These significant judgments include: (1) determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer; (2) applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time; and (3) estimating how and when contingencies, or other forms of variable consideration, will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue. The timing and revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. This accounting standard requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nThroughout the past 3-5 years, we targeted companies with technology that fit our portfolio and align with our strategic vision for 5G innovation. The impairment was primarily driven by lackluster business performance as a result of turbulent economic factors such as the impact of COVID-19, chip shortages, our declining stock price and our inability to secure adequate funding to service our customers. We believe that in the absence of future positive cash flow, declines in revenue generation, or continued difficult business conditions, further impairments may be required. The Company will monitor such economic conditions and record such additional charges when and if necessary.\nWe account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $41.4 million and $106.1 million, respectively.\nOur acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nAssumptions must be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, tax rates and remaining useful lives. These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a businesss fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation costs in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718, which requires companies to measure the cost of awards of equity instruments, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the employees requisite service period or the non-employees vesting period. An employees requisite service period is the period of time over which an employee must provide service in exchange for an award under a share-based payment arrangement and generally is presumed to be the vesting period. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item 7A. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and supplementary data are on pages through. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and acting principal financial and accounting officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, consisting of our principal executive officer and acting principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and acting principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, consisting of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, due to the material weaknesses discussed further below.\n(b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to ensure that material information regarding our operations is made available to management and the Board of Directors to provide them reasonable assurance that the published financial statements are fairly presented. There are limitations inherent in any set of internal controls, such as the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. As a result, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. As conditions change over time, so to may the effectiveness of internal controls.\nOur management, consisting of our principal executive officer and acting principal financial and accounting officer, have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission and have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the following material weaknesses that were first identified in 2021, continued to exist as of December 31, 2022.\n\u25cf we do not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of our accounting staff;\n\u25cf there is a lack of timely reconciliations of account balances; and\n\u25cf there is a lack of documented and tested internal controls to meet the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nManagement believes that these material weaknesses exist due to a lack of resources. Upon an improvement of the Companys liquidity challenges, management intends to add accounting personnel, operating staff, and utilize consultants, where appropriate, in order to remediate these material weaknesses. In addition, management intends to invest in more sophisticated accounting and finance systems in order to improve our internal and external reporting procedures and internal controls, subject to available capital. Until we have adequate resources to address these issues, any material weaknesses may materially adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial condition and results of operations in the future in a timely and reliable manner. In addition, although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any such additional weaknesses or failure to remediate the existing weaknesses could materially adversely affect our financial condition or ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and the requirements of our various financing agreements.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this Annual Report.

The term of office for each director will be until his or her successor is elected at our next annual meeting or his or her death, resignation or removal, whichever is earliest to occur.\nWhile we do not have a stand-alone diversity policy, in considering whether to recommend any director nominee, including candidates recommended by stockholders, we believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors, considered as a group, should provide a significant mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow our board of directors to fulfill its responsibilities. As set forth in our corporate governance guidelines, when considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills, taken as a whole, to enable our board of directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Board focuses primarily on each persons background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the directors individual biographies set forth above. We believe that our directors and director nominees will provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business.\nOur board of directors expects a culture of ethical business conduct and encourages each member to conduct a self-review to determine if he or she is providing effective service with respect to both our Company and our stockholders. Should it be determined that a member of our board of directors is unable to effectively act in the best interests of our stockholders, such member would be encouraged to resign.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur amended and restated bylaws and our corporate governance guidelines provide our board of directors with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure is in the best interests of our Company.

Except as indicated by footnote, to our knowledge, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them.\nIn the table below, the percentage of beneficial ownership of our common stock is based on 2,695,571 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 6, 2023 plus that amount of our securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days after December 6, 2023. Unless otherwise noted below, the address of the persons listed on the table is c/o COMSovereign Holding Corp., 6890 E Sunrise Drive, #120-506, Tucson, AZ 85750.\nName of Beneficial Owner Amount and\nNature of\nBeneficial\nOwnership Percentage of\nClass(%) (1)\nNamed Executive Officers and Directors\nDavid A.

On December 6, 2023, there were 2,695,571 shares of our common stock outstanding. To calculate a stockholders percentage of beneficial ownership, we include in the numerator and denominator the common stock outstanding and all shares of our common stock issuable to that person in the event of the exercise of outstanding options and other derivative securities owned by that person which are exercisable within 60 days of December 6, 2023. Common stock options and derivative securities held by other stockholders are disregarded in this calculation. Therefore, the denominator used in calculating beneficial ownership among our stockholders may differ. Unless we have indicated otherwise, each person named in the table has sole voting power and sole investment power for the shares listed opposite such persons name.\n(2) Includes 15,319 shares held directly by Mr. McIntire, and 480 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 1,668 shares of common stock underlying options that are exercisable by Mr. McIntire.\n(3) Includes 1,953 shares held by the Kevin M. Sherlock Revocable Trust, and 1,668 shares of common stock underlying options that are exercisable by Mr. Sherlock. Mr. Sherlock has voting and dispositive control over the shares held by the trust.\n(4) Includes 4,282 shares held directly by Mr. Berman, 428 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 2,250 shares of common stock underlying options that are exercisable by Mr. Mr. Berman.\n(5) Includes 667 shares held directly by Ms. Kapoor that were a restricted stock award made in January 2021 which shares vest in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversaries of her service on our board, and 2,000 shares of common stock underlying options that are exercisable by Ms. Kapoor. We recognized a $150,000 expense in 2022 related to such restricted stock grant.\n(6) Represents 2,854 shares held directly by Mr. Marks, 334 shares held by Spidernet, Inc., and 2,000 shares of common stock underlying options that are exercisable by Mr. Marks. Mr. Marks has voting and dispositive control over the shares held by Spidernet, Inc.\nFrom time to time, the number of our shares held in the street name accounts of various securities dealers for the benefit of their clients or in centralized securities depositories may exceed 5% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.\nProcedures for Approval of Related Party Transactions\nA related party transaction is any actual or proposed transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, including those involving indebtedness not in the ordinary course of business, to which we or our subsidiaries were or are a party, or in which we or our subsidiaries were or are a participant, in which the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the lesser of (i) $120,000 or (ii) one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any related party had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A related party includes:\n\u25cf any person who is, or at any time during the applicable period was, one of our executive officers or one of our directors;\n\u25cf any person who beneficially owns more than 5% of our common stock;\n\u25cf any immediate family member of any of the foregoing; or\n\u25cf any entity in which any of the foregoing is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest.\nIn April 2020, our board of directors adopted a written related-party transactions policy. Pursuant to this policy, the Audit Committee of our board of directors will review all material facts of all related-party transactions and either approve or disapprove entry into the related-party transaction, subject to certain limited exceptions. In determining whether to approve or disapprove entry into a related-party transaction, our Audit Committee shall take into account, among other factors, the following: (i) whether the related-party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances; (ii) the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction; and (iii) whether the transaction would impair the independence of a non-employee director.\nRelated Party Transactions\nOther than compensation arrangements for our named executive officers and directors, which we describe above, the only related party transactions to which we were a party during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 or any currently proposed related party transaction, are as follows:\nOn April 1, 2022, Dustin H. McIntire, our CTO, loaned $100,000 to the Company. The Company gave Mr. McIntire an unsecured promissory note for the $100,000 loan, with three per cent (3%) interest. On March 31, 2023, the Company amended the note to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2023 with an interest rate of 5.5% commencing on April 1, 2023.\nOn September 1, 2023, Dustin H. McIntire, our CTO, loaned $260,000 to the Company which was used to secure a software license for the Company. Upon being notified of the proposed loan, the Audit Committee reviewed the transaction under the Companys related party transaction policy and approved the transaction. The Company issued Mr. McIntire a secured convertible promissory note for the $260,000 loan, with eight per cent (8%) interest, secured by the software license. See Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Business Developments and Debt and Equity Developments. ITEM 14.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses, negative cash flows from operations and has limited resources that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets with Definite-Lives\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, long-lived assets including definite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company utilizes an income approach using an undiscounted cash flow model to assess the recoverability of the definite-lived intangibles, comparing its undiscounted cash flows to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds undiscounted cash flows, the Company will use a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value, and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible assets exceeds fair value. During 2022 an impairment charge was recorded in the amount of $12.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had definite-lived intangible assets with a net carrying value of approximately $1.4 million.\nAuditing the Companys impairment tests for intangible assets with definite lives was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation in managements assumptions to calculate the undiscounted cash flows and the fair value estimate. These assumptions can significantly affect the undiscounted cash flows and fair value of the intangible asset with definite lives.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit\nTo test the Companys impairment assessment for intangible assets with definite lives, we performed audit procedures that included the following:\n\u25cf We evaluated the Companys projected revenues and cash flows by comparing the projections to historical results, marketing plans and other relevant economic factors.\n\u25cf We evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, the discount rates and royalty rates, and tested the impairment calculations for the intangible assets by verifying and recreating the valuation calculations.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nDescription of the Matter\nAs reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022, the Companys goodwill was $7.3 million. As disclosed in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment require the performance of an interim impairment assessment. As a result of these assessments, management concluded that there was an impairment to goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022, in the amount of $29.3 million.\nAuditing managements impairment tests of goodwill is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair values of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates of the reporting units were sensitive to changes in significant assumptions such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating margins, estimated spending on capital expenditures, terminal growth rates, and comparable company specific information. These assumptions are affected by current and expected future market or economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the selection of the discount rates and forecasts of future net sales, operating margins, operating expenses, and other market and economic data of the reporting units, included the following, among other:\n\u25cf We obtained an understanding of the Companys process and related controls to evaluate goodwill for impairment. We evaluated the reasonableness of managements forecasts of future net sales, operating margins and operating expenses by comparing the forecasts to historical results, managements marketing plans, other relevant economic factors, and comparable company and industry information. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models and performed sensitivity analyses.\n\u25cf We involved our valuation specialist to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and market multiples.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nNew York, NY\nDecember 6, 2023\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 1,868 $ 1,873\nAccounts receivable, net 1,126 1,376\nInventory, net 3,966 10,249\nPrepaid expenses 3,571 6,936\nNote receivable -

Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys significant estimates consist of the valuation of stock-based compensation; the valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired; the valuation of the Companys equity securities issued in transactions; the valuation of inventory; the allowance for credit losses; the valuation of equity securities; the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm and involves management making significant estimates and assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are represented by operating accounts or money market accounts maintained with insured financial institutions, including all short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAccounts Receivable and Credit Policies\nTrade accounts receivable consist of amounts due from the sale of the Companys products and services. Such accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 to 45 days of receipt of the invoice. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a reserve in the amount of $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for estimated uncollectible accounts.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and trade accounts receivables. The Company places its cash with high-credit-quality financial institutions. At times, such cash may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage limit of $250,000 per depositor. As a result, there could be a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company has not experienced any losses due to these excess deposits and believes the risk is not significant. With respect to net trade receivables, management routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that the receivable credit risk exposure is limited.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company accounts for and discloses related party transactions in accordance with FASB ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures. A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.\nInventory\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). The cost of inventory is calculated on a standard cost basis, which approximates weighted average actual cost. NRV is determined as the market value for finished goods, replacement cost for raw materials and finished goods market value less cost to complete for work in progress inventory. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records an impairment for excess and obsolete inventory, when necessary, based on factors including its estimated forecast of product demand, the stage of the product life cycle and production requirements for the units in question. Indirect manufacturing costs and direct labor expenses are allocated systematically to the total production inventory.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost when acquired. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:\nAsset Type\nUseful Life\nShop machinery and equipment\n3-5 years\nComputers and electronics\n2 years\nOffice furniture and fixtures\n3-5 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of remaining\nlease term or 5 years\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, whereas expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or loss is included in the results of operations for the respective period.\nLong-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nThe Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment, Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. This accounting standard requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. ASC 350 requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset has decreased below its carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain reporting units fair value was below their reporting units carrying amount due to a decline in the Companys market capitalization and lack of performance of the business units. Accordingly, it was necessary to perform impairment testing. See Note 12 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion related to triggering events.\nIn determining whether a quantitative assessment is required, the Company will evaluate relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after performing the qualitative assessment, an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would perform the quantitative impairment test described in ASC 350. However, if, after applying the qualitative assessment, the entity concludes that it is not more than likely that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The Company bases these assumptions on its historical data and experience, industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition projections, and its expectations.\nThe Company calculates the estimated fair value of a reporting unit using a weighting of the income and market approaches and compares it to the carrying values. For the income approach, the Company uses internally developed discounted cash flow models that include the following assumptions, among others: projections of revenues, expenses, and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments to grow new units; and estimated discount rates. For the market approach, the Company uses internal analyses based primarily on market comparables. The Company bases these assumptions on its historical data and experience, third party appraisals, industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition projections, and its expectations. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. See Note 12 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion related to impairment.\nBeneficial Conversion Features and Warrants\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated the conversion feature of convertible debt instruments to determine whether the conversion feature was beneficial as described in ASC 470-30, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature (BCF) related to the issuance of convertible debt that had conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued and recorded the relative fair value of any warrants issued with those instruments. The BCF for the convertible instruments was recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features, both of which were credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company calculated the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible instruments using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model involves the use of significant estimates, including the risk-free interest rate, expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, and contractual life of the award.\nUnder these guidelines, the Company first allocates the value of the proceeds received from a convertible debt transaction between the convertible debt instrument and any other detachable instruments included in the transaction (such as warrants) on a relative fair value basis. A BCF is then measured as the intrinsic value of the conversion option at the commitment date, representing the difference between the effective conversion price and the Companys stock price on the commitment date multiplied by the number of shares into which the debt instrument is convertible. The allocated value of the BCF and warrants are recorded as a debt discount and accreted over the expected term of the convertible debt as interest expense. If the intrinsic value of the BCF is greater than the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt instrument, the amount of the discount assigned to the BCF is limited to the amount of the proceeds allocated to the convertible debt instrument. During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was no material impact resulting from conversion features.\nBeginning on January 1, 2022, with the adoption of ASU 2020-06, it was no longer necessary to evaluate whether a conversion feature was beneficial.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn June 21, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Sovereign Plastics business unit to TheLandersCompanies LLC for total consideration of $2.0 million in a secured note with interest of 5% and a maturity date of May 31, 2025. The assets and liabilities of Sovereign Plastics are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively. The results of operations of Sovereign Plastics are included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For comparative purposes, all prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the classifications on a consistent basis (see Note 3 - Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for additional information).\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nOn March 20, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its Sky Sapience business unit to Titan Innovations Ltd. for total consideration of $1.8 million. Assets and liabilities of Sky Sapience are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 3 - Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Business Developments for additional information).\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement) as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market corroborated inputs.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability being measured. These inputs may be used with standard pricing models or other valuation or internally-developed methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value.\nThe Company utilizes fair value measurements primarily in conjunction with the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In addition, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. In general, nonfinancial assets including goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment are measured at fair value when there is an indication of impairment and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment is recognized.\nAs allowed by applicable FASB guidance, the Company has elected not to apply the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities to any of its currently eligible financial assets or liabilities. The Companys financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable. The Company has determined that the book value of its outstanding financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 approximated their fair value due to their short-term nature.\nDebt Discounts\nThe Company records debt discounts as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related indebtedness on its Consolidated Balance Sheet with the respective debt discount amortized in interest expense on its Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the issuance of certain notes payable and senior convertible debentures, the Company, or its subsidiaries, issued warrants to purchase shares of its common stock and had BCFs prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, which was adopted on January 1, 2022. See Note 14 - Debt. The warrants are exercisable at various exercise prices per share. The Company evaluated the terms of these warrants at issuance and concluded that they should be treated as equity. The fair value of the warrants was determined by using the Black-Scholes model and was recorded as a debt discount offsetting the carrying value of the debt obligation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nThe Company presents debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related indebtedness on its Consolidated Balance Sheet and amortizes these costs over the term of the related debt liability using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. Amortization is recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Companys operations and balances denominated in foreign currencies, including those of its foreign Canadian subsidiary, DragonWave, and its Israeli subsidiaries, SKS and SAGUNA, that are primarily a direct and integral component or extension of the Companys operations, are translated into U.S. dollars (USD) using the following: monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rate; non-monetary assets are translated at the historical exchange rate; and revenue and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate and records the translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Foreign currency transaction gains are included in foreign currency transaction gain in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and has since issued various amendments which provide additional clarification and implementation guidance on Topic 606. This guidance establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The Company accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Topic 606. This guidance sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model which replaced the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance and to require more detailed disclosures. The five steps of the revenue recognition model are: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in the contract with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each. To determine the performance obligation, the Company considers all products and services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or implied by customary business practices. The timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment. The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods and services. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers that are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nManagement has determined that it has performance obligations related to its products and services: telecom hardware, repairs, support and maintenance, drones, consulting, warranties and other. Revenue from telecom hardware, repairs, support and maintenance, drones, and other are all recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally occurring upon shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the underlying contract, or services is completed. Revenue from warranties is recognized over time using an input method that results in a straight-line basis recognition over the warranty period, as the contract usually provides the customer equal benefit throughout the warranty period. Revenue from consulting services is recognized over time using an input method of labor hours expensed, as it directly measures the efforts toward satisfying the performance obligation.\nFor contracts with customers that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for the promised performance obligations separately as individual performance obligations if they are distinct. In determining whether performance obligations meet the criteria for being distinct, the Company considers several factors, including the degree of interrelation and interdependence between obligations and whether or not the good or service significantly modifies or transforms another good or service in the contract. After identifying the separate performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company generally determines the standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. Judgment may be used to determine the standalone selling prices for items that are not sold separately, including taking into consideration either historical pricing practices or an adjusted market assessment. Unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period primarily consist of products and services for which customer purchase orders have been accepted and that are in the process of being delivered.\nTransaction price is calculated as the selling price less any variable consideration, consisting of rebates and discounts. Discounts provided to customers are known at contract inception. Rebates are calculated on the expected value method where the Company (1) estimates the probability of each rebate amount which could be earned by the distributor, (2) multiplies each estimated amount by its assigned probability factor, and (3) calculates a final sum of each of the probability-weighted amounts calculated in step (2). The sum calculated in step (3) is the rebate amount, which along with discounts reduces the amount of revenue recognized.\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost rather than as an additional promised service. As a result, the Company accrues the costs of shipping and handling when the related revenue is recognized. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in costs of goods sold on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe Company records contract assets when it has a right to consideration and records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration. The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received (or unconditional rights to receive cash) in advance of fulfilling its performance obligations. When the services have been performed or the goods delivered, revenue will be recognized, and contract liabilities will be reduced.\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. The majority of the Companys performance obligations in its contracts with customers relate to contracts with durations of less than one year. The transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations included in contracts with durations of more than 12 months is reflected in contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $3.4 million and $3.4 million of deferred revenue, respectively, from contracts with customers. The contract liabilities represent payments received from customers for which the Company had not yet satisfied its performance obligation under the contract.\nApplying a practical expedient, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts, which primarily consist of sales commissions, as expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less. If the service period, inclusive of any anticipated renewal, is longer than a year, the incremental direct costs are capitalized and amortized over the period of benefit. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no such capitalized costs.\nThe Company also applies the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for the good or service will be one year or less. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, there were no such financing components.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nResearch and Development\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are expensed as incurred unless they meet generally accepted accounting criteria for deferral and amortization. Development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility do not meet these criteria and are expensed as incurred.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation costs in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to measure the cost of awards of equity instruments, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize it as compensation expense over the employees requisite service period or the non-employees vesting period. An employees requisite service period is the period of time over which an employee must provide service in exchange for an award under a share-based payment arrangement and generally is presumed to be the vesting period.\nBeginning in 2020, for employee awards, the Company elected to utilize the simplified method of estimating the expected life of options as allowed by U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107. The Company believes this to be a better estimate of the expected life given the lack of historical information. For nonemployee awards, the Company will utilize the stated term of the award. Forfeitures will be accounted for as they occur for both employee and nonemployee awards. Upon exercise or conversion of any share-based payment transaction, the Company will issue shares, generally as new issuances.\nShare-based compensation for employees and non-employees is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of general and administrative expense with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital in stockholders (deficiency) equity.\nLeases\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases and a series of related Accounting Standards Updates that followed (collectively referred to as Topic 842). Topic 842 requires organizations to recognize right-of-use (ROU) lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous lease guidance. The FASB retained the distinction between finance leases and operating leases, leaving the effect of leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows largely unchanged from previous U.S. GAAP. The Company utilized the transition method allowed under ASU 2018-11 in which an entity initially applies the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit in the period of adoption, if any.\nThe Company determines, at contract inception, whether or not an arrangement contains a lease and evaluates the contract for classification as an operating or finance lease. For all leases, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments, including annual rent increases, over the lease term at commencement date. If the Companys lease does not provide an implicit rate in the contract, the Company uses its incremental, secured borrowing rate based on lease term information available as of the adoption date or lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Any renewal periods are considered in the analysis of each lease to the extent that the Company considers them to be reasonably certain of being exercised.\nCosts associated with operating leases are recorded as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. The single lease cost includes the cost of amortizing the operating lease ROU asset and accretion expense related to the operating lease liability and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Costs associated with finance leases are recorded by amortizing the finance lease ROU asset, which is recorded as amortization on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the accretion of the finance lease liability, recognized as interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Company recorded loss on extinguishment of debt for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $7.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Gain or loss on extinguishment of debt consists of the difference between the fair value of the reacquisition consideration and the carrying amount of debt on the date it was paid off.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes utilizing ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the measurement of deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and of deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences. Measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not included in the measurement. The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events and transactions that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their ultimate realization. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nThe Company also follows the guidance for accounting for income tax uncertainties. In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. No liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. If the Company has to recognize any interest or penalties associated with its tax positions or returns, any interest or penalties will be recorded as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nThe Company has adopted ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and also simplifies areas such as franchise taxes, step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate entity financial statements and interim recognition of enactment of tax laws and rate changes. ASU 2019-12 was effective for the Company in the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.\nReportable Segments and Reporting Units\nThe Company currently operates as one Segment. A reporting unit (RU) is a component of an operating segment that is a business activity for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The Companys legal operating subsidiaries are not organized to qualify as a segment, however, through December 31, 2022, each operating entity has separate financial information and an operating manager, who oversees the business and financial activities, reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. (CODM). Therefore, each legal entity is deemed to be a separate reporting unit.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 requires use of a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 was originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Effective Dates, to finalize the effective date delays for private companies, not-for-profits, and smaller reporting companies applying the current expected credit losses (CECL) standards. The ASU is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating certain accounting models when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in-capital. Under this ASU, certain debt instruments with embedded conversion features will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally, this ASU eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments. The new guidance is effective for smaller reporting companies during annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2022 which eliminates the need on a go forward basis to assess whether a beneficial conversion feature needs to be recognized upon either (a) the issuance of new convertible securities; or (b) the resolution of any prior period contingent beneficial conversion features. The early adoption did not have an immediate material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuers Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This new standard provides clarification and reduces diversity in an issuers accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (such as warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Companies should apply the new standard prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring after the effective date of the new standard. This standard was adopted on January 1, 2022 and\nNOTE 3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nSovereign Plastics LLC\nSovereign Plastics is a manufacturer of plastic and metal components to third-party manufacturers based out of Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Companys Board of Directors, in consultation with management as well as its financial and legal advisors, considered a number of factors, including the risks and challenges facing Sovereign Plastics in the future as compared to the opportunities available to Sovereign Plastics in the future, and the availability of strategic alternatives. On June 13, 2022, after careful consideration, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the sale of Sovereign Plastics.\nOn June 21, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Sovereign Plastics business unit to TheLandersCompanies LLC for total consideration of $2.0 million in a secured note with interest of 5% and a maturity date of May 31, 2025. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a $1.1 million gain on the sale of Sovereign Plastics included in the income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nThe results and net income (loss) of Sovereign Plastics discontinued operations were as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nRevenue $ 1,718 $ 3,576\nCost of goods sold 1,065 1,915\nGross profit 1,661\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative 1,394\nDepreciation and amortization\nGain on sale of Sovereign Plastics (1,074 ) -\nTotal operating income (expenses), net (100 ) 2,027\nIncome (loss) from operations (366 )\nOther expense\nInterest expense (6 ) (51 )\nLoss on extinguishment of debt -\n(246 )\nTotal other expense (6 ) (297 )\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 747 $ (663 )\nAssets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2021 were classified as current and non-current because the sale transaction did not qualify as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2021, and because the consideration of $2.0 million for the sale is due on May 31, 2023 and is recorded as a note receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Companys Board of Directors, in consultation with management as well as its financial and legal advisors, considered a number of factors, including the risks and challenges facing Sky Sapience in the future as compared to the opportunities available to Sky Sapience in the future, and the availability of strategic alternatives. On December 21, 2022, after careful consideration, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the sale of Sky Sapience. On March 20, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its Sky Sapience business unit to Titan Innovations Ltd. for total consideration of $1.8 million (see Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Business Developments for additional information). The sale of Sky Sapience didnt qualify for discontinued operations presentation because the sale didnt represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Companys operations (the Company will continue to be in the drone business). Sky Sapiences assets and liabilities met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 as follows:\nSky Sapience\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nAssets\nCash $ 35\nInventory, net\nPrepaid and deferred expenses\nOther current assets\nAssets held for sale - current\nProperty and equipment, net\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nIntangible assets, net\nGoodwill 1,219\nAssets held for sale - long-term 2,374\nTotal assets held for sale $ 3,025\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable $ 233\nAccrued liabilities\nAccrued payroll\nContract liabilities, current 1,347\nOperating lease liabilities, current\nLiabilities of assets held for sale - current 2,342\nOperating lease liabilities - long term\nLiabilities held for sale - long-term\nTotal liabilities held for sale $ 2,482\nNOTE 4 GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY\nU.S. GAAP requires management to assess a companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance and to provide related note disclosures in certain circumstances.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated negative cash flows from operations of $9.5 million and had an accumulated deficit of $297.6 million and working capital deficit of $15.9 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund growth initiatives. Based on current cash on hand and subsequent activity as described herein (see Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Business Developments and Debt and Equity Developments), the Company presently only has enough cash on hand to operate on a month-to-month basis, without raising additional capital or selling assets. Because of the Companys limited cash availability, its operations have been scaled back to the extent possible (see Note 21 - Other Business Developments - Business Developments and Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Business Developments). Management continues to explore opportunities with third parties and related parties; however, it has not entered into any agreement to provide the necessary additional capital, except as disclosed herein.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nThe Company will continue to pursue the actions outlined above, as well as work towards increasing revenue and operating cash flows to meet its future liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any capital-raising or profit-enhancing efforts that it may undertake, and these planned actions do not alleviate the substantial doubt. If the Company is not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis, it may have to further delay vendor payments and/or initiate cost reductions, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately, it could be forced to discontinue operations, liquidate assets and/or seek reorganization under the U.S. bankruptcy code.\nNOTE 5 REVENUE\nRevenue by type consisted of the following for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\nTelecom hardware $ 4,234 $ 5,871\nRepairs -\nSupport & maintenance\nDrones 4,828\nConsulting\nWarranty -\nOther\nTotal revenue $ 9,878 $ 9,064\nThe following table is a summary of the Companys timing of revenue recognition for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\nTiming of revenue recognition:\nServices and products transferred at a point in time $ 9,624 $ 8,657\nServices and products transferred over time\nTotal revenue $ 9,878 $ 9,064\nThe Company disaggregates revenue by source and geographic destination to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nRevenue by source consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\nRevenue by products and services:\nProducts $ 9,624 $ 7,760\nServices 1,304\nTotal revenue $ 9,878 $ 9,064\nRevenue by geographic destination consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\nRevenue by geography:\nNorth America $ 9,165 $ 7,991\nInternational 1,073\nTotal revenue $ 9,878 $ 9,064\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nContract Balances\nThe Company records contract assets when it has a right to consideration and records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration.

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to stock options, restricted stock units and warrants for each period.\nPotential common shares issuable to employees, non-employees and directors upon exercise or conversion of shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share when the effect would be anti-dilutive. All potential common shares are anti-dilutive in periods of net loss attributable to common shareholders. Stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive when the exercise price of these instruments is greater than the average market price of the Companys common stock for the period (out-of-the-money), regardless of whether the Company is in a period of net loss attributable to common shareholders.\nThe following weighted-average potential common shares were excluded from the diluted loss per common share as their effect was anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDecember 31,\nOptions 26,554 70,405\nWarrants 115,899 128,771\nConvertible notes 21,728 58,860\n164,181 258,036\nNOTE 7 CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDecember 31,\n(Amounts in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,868 $ 1,596\nRestricted cash -\nTotal $ 1,868 $ 1,873\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are represented by operating accounts or money market accounts maintained with insured financial institutions, including cash equivalents, defined as all short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

The Tucson Building had a carrying value of $6.7 million, including the $4.8 million cost basis of the building, the $1.3 million cost basis of the land, and the $0.8 million related to building improvements, partially offset by $0.2 million of accumulated depreciation. The Company recognized an $8.4 million gain on sale of assets, which is net of $0.7 million of related transaction costs.

As a result, the Company determined it was a triggering event. Accordingly, it was necessary to perform impairment testing.

Monthly payments are approximately $16,000 during the remaining life of the lease. The lease did not include an implicit rate of return; therefore, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on other leases with similar terms.\nAs part of the RVision business acquisition on April 1, 2021, the Company assumed a lease of office space with a remaining term of approximately 33 months that will expire on March 31, 2024. Monthly payments are $7,000 during the remaining life of the lease. The lease did not include an implicit rate of return; therefore, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on other leases with similar terms.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement with the new owners of the Tucson Building (see Note 11 - Property and Equipment, Net), for a term of 10 years with no option to renew. Monthly rent increases annually from $98,300 per month in year one to $128,200 a month in the final year of the lease. The Company posted a $1.0 million security deposit in connection with the commencement of the lease, which was initially classified in other assets - long term and subsequently reclassified against lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company determined that the transactions represented a sale and leaseback and, accordingly, established a new operating lease ROU asset and operating lease liability of $10.1 million. The lease did not include an implicit rate of return; therefore, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on other leases with similar terms. In May 2022, the Company abandoned its lease of the Tucson Building after previously defaulting on the lease.\nIn June 2022, ComSovereign Corp. abandoned its Dallas, TX office lease and VEO Photonics, Inc. abandoned its San Diego, CA office lease. In July 2022, the Company abandoned its Chantilly, VA office lease. In connection with the lease abandonments for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $13.6 million in losses due to the write-offs of the ROU-assets and other abandoned assets and applied its security deposit assets against its operating lease liabilities (including $10.1 million related to the Tucson Building).

On August 25, 2021, the Company entered into a first amendment and limited waiver to the securities purchase agreement dated as of May 27, 2021 and amended and restated the convertible note. The amended note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of funding and matures on May 27, 2023. The Company is required to make monthly interest and principal payments in 18 equal monthly installments of $611,000 each, commencing in November 2021. So long as shares of the Companys common stock are registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or may be sold without restriction on the number of shares or manner of sale, the Company has the right to make interest and principal payments in the form of additional shares of common stock, which shares will be valued at 90% of the average of the five lowest daily volume weighted average price per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of issuance of such shares of common stock. The note is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiaries and is secured by a Securities Purchase Agreement (Initial SPA) securing a first priority lien on substantially all of the Companys assets and properties and the assets and properties of its subsidiaries, subject only to the liens securing the approximately $1.5 million principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in connection with three of our subsidiaries. The warrants are exercisable to purchase up to 18,200 shares of the Companys common stock for a purchase price of $300 per share, subject to adjustment, at any time on or prior to May 27, 2026, and may be exercised on a cashless basis if the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants are not then registered under the Securities Act.\nOn or about April 15, 2022, as a result of the Company not filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 on a timely basis, the Note entered into default, which resulted in a 5% or $0.2 million increase in the principal value, pursuant to the terms of the Note. The default also enabled the note holders, upon notice to the Company, to periodically convert a portion of the associated principal and accrued interest into common stock at a 20% discount to the three lowest daily volume-weighted-average-prices during the prior twenty trading days (Note Holder Conversions). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the principal amount was reduced by an aggregate of $6.4 million, which was comprised of (a) a reduction of an aggregate of $1.2 million (plus interest) due to pre-default scheduled cash payments; (b) a reduction of an aggregate of $1.2 million (plus interest) due to pre-default scheduled equity payments (at the Companys discretion, in lieu of cash) comprising 22,834 shares of common stock; (c) an increase of an aggregate of $0.2 million (as discussed above) due to the debts contractual default provisions; and (d) a reduction of an aggregate of $4.1 million of principal due to Note Holder Conversions into an aggregate of 802,463 shares of the Companys common stock.

The note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of funding and matures on August 25, 2023. The Company is required to make monthly interest and principal payments in 18 equal monthly installments of $322,000 each, commencing in November 2021. So long as shares of our common stock are registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or may be sold without restriction on the number of shares or manner of sale, the Company has the right to make interest and principal payments in the form of additional shares of common stock, which shares will be valued at 90% of the average of the five lowest daily volume weighted average price per share of the common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of issuance of such shares of common stock. The note is convertible by the holder in whole or in part at any time after the six-month anniversary of the issuance date into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $300 per share, subject to adjustment and certain limitations. The Company has the right to prepay the amended note at any time with no penalty. However, should the Company exercise its buy-back right, the holder of the amended note will have the option of converting 33 1/3% of the outstanding principal amount of the note into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of (A) the repayment price, or (B) the conversion price then in effect. The note is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiaries and is secured by a Securities Purchase Agreement (Second SPA and collectively with the Initial SPA, the SPAs) securing a first priority lien on substantially all of the Companys assets and properties and the assets and properties of its subsidiaries, subject only to the liens securing the approximately $1.5 million principal amount of outstanding indebtedness of three of our subsidiaries. The warrants are exercisable to purchase up to 13,158 shares of the Companys common stock for a purchase price of $300 per share, subject to adjustment, at any time on or prior to August 25, 2026, and may be exercised on a cashless basis if the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants are not then registered under the Securities Act.\nOn or about April 15, 2022, as a result of the Company not filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 on a timely basis, the Note entered into default, which resulted in a 5% or $0.2 million increase in the principal value, pursuant to the terms of the Note. The default also enabled the note holders, upon notice to the Company, to periodically convert a portion of the associated principal and accrued interest into common stock at a 20% discount to the three lowest daily volume-weighted-average-prices during the prior twenty trading days (Note Holder Conversions).

Upon an event of default, the interest rate would have automatically increased to 15% per annum on any unpaid principal and interest, compounded monthly, and all unpaid principal and accrued interest would become due on-demand. Accrued interest was calculated on a compound basis and was payable semi-annually in May and November of each year. The note was secured by all of the assets of DragonWave and was guaranteed by ComSovereign pursuant to the November 26, 2019 Secured Loan Agreement. The debt issuance costs were the result of the issuance of 3,500 shares of common stock of the Company and a cash payment of $80,000. The Company defaulted on this loan during 2021, causing the interest rate to increase to a monthly compounded rate of 15% per annum, a late charge of 5% to be incurred, and the loan and accrued interest to become due on-demand. Amounts recorded as debt discounts and issuance costs were fully amortized and recognized in interest expense during 2021 as a result of the loan becoming due on-demand from the default event. On January 26, 2021, $1.0 million of the principal amount of this loan and all accrued interest with a combined total of $1.2 million, was fully extinguished at the rate of $415 per unit, as defined in our public offering, resulting in the issuance of 2,957 shares of issued common stock of the Company, along with warrants to purchase up to 2,957 shares of common stock that are exercisable for a purchase price of $450 per share at any time on or prior to January 26, 2026. This loan has been in default since November 26, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, principal and interest of $0.5 million was paid in cash and the remaining interest and fees of $275,000 were compounded into principal outstanding.

On July 26, 2022, the Company received notice from the promissory note holder that the promissory note in the principal amount of $550,000 was due. As of the date of this filing, this note remains outstanding.

On March 14, 2023, the note was retro-amended to extend the maturity date to July 29, 2024 with an interest rate of 8% and the ability to convert principal and interest into shares of the Companys common stock at a 10% discount to the closing price on which the conversion is elected effective September 15, 2023. In addition, the note became secured with a second priority security interest on the assets of its Lighter Than Air Systems Corp. (d/b/a Drone Aviation Corp) business and agreed to extend the term of the advisory for an additional two years pursuant to the original note and issue an additional 12,000 shares of the Companys restricted stock per year while the note is outstanding. See Note 22 - Subsequent Events - Debt and Equity Developments for additional information.\nFor Note G, on January 29, 2021, the Company entered into a secured $5.2 million term loan that bore interest at the higher rate of 8% or LIBOR plus 6.75%, that matured in January 2022 in connection with our acquisition of the Tucson Building.

See Note 11 - Property and Equipment, Net for additional information related to the Tucson Building sale.\nFor Note H, on December 6, 2022, the Company sold a secured $50,000 promissory note bearing no interest for the purchase of components for which the lender agreed to receive payments with a maturity date of June 30, 2023. The note was secured by the components purchased and was guaranteed by ComSovereign pursuant to the December 6, 2022 Agreement for the Purchase and Sale of Components.

The PPP loan had a maturity of 2 years and an interest rate of 1% per annum. The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable pursuant to section 1106 of the CARES Act, after a period of up to 24 weeks, as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness shall be calculated in accordance with the requirements of the PPP, including the provisions of Section 1106 of the CARES Act, although no more than 40 percent of the amount forgiven can be attributable to non-payroll costs. Further, the amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the period of up to 24 weeks. During the year ended December 31, 2021, an aggregate amount of $0.7 million had been forgiven under these loans. Additional PPP loans were applied for in 2021 and were forgiven in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the remaining aggregate principal of $2,000 of these notes was fully repaid.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nFor Note M, on June 3, 2021, in connection with the acquisition of Innovation Digital, the Company issued to the seller a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $0.6 million. The convertible promissory bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum, matures on June 3, 2022 and is convertible into shares of the Companys common stock commencing on December 3, 2021 at an initial conversion price of $235 per share; provided, however, that on the maturity date, the holder may (i) demand payment of the entire outstanding principal balance and all unpaid accrued interest under Convertible Note or (ii) continue to hold the Convertible Note, in which case the convertible note shall thereafter accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually, until such time as (x) the holder makes a demand of payment and the convertible note is repaid in full; or (y) the convertible note is converted in full. If the convertible note is converted into shares of the Companys common stock after the maturity date of the convertible note, the conversion price will be the closing price of our common stock on the date the conversion notice is provided to the Company. On June 3, 2022, this note went into default. On June 23, 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the former owners of Innovation Digital to return to the former owners of Innovation Digital 15 patents and 5 pending or provisional patents to those former owners in return for the cancellation of the outstanding $600,000 promissory note, the return of 5,000 shares of common stock, and the waiver of certain severance payments. See Note 21 - Other Business Developments for additional information.\nFor Note N, on January 29, 2021, in connection with its acquisition of FastBack, the Company issued to the sellers $11.2 million aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes. The individual principal amounts of the notes ranged from $6,000 to $5,600,000. These notes initially bear interest at the rate of 1.01% per annum, which is to be adjusted to the prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal on each annual anniversary of the issuance date and mature on January 29, 2026. Interest is payable in cash annually in arrears on each January 1. As of January 29, 2022, the outstanding principal and accrued interest on these notes may be converted in full to shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price of $522 per share, subject to adjustment. Upon an event of default, the interest rate will automatically increase to 15% per annum compounded annually, and all unpaid principal and accrued interest may become due on-demand. Principal and any unpaid accrued interest are due on the maturity date. Upon maturity, the interest rate will automatically increase to 15% per annum compounded annually on any unpaid principal. On May 24, 2022, the Company received notice from counsel for holders of $11.2 million of convertible promissory notes issued in connection with the acquisition of FastBack that the Company had failed to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K in a timely manner, as required by the terms of the convertible promissory notes. While the note holders have the right to accelerate the maturity of the principal, the notice simply indicated that the holders were reserving their rights. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of $1.3 million of principal is classified as long-term debt pursuant to post-December 31, 2022 special conversions of principal and accrued interest into 280,625 shares of the Companys common stock, pursuant to a limited time offer for conversions at a discounted rate of 81% of the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the day special conversion notices were received.

Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years. We estimate $8.3 million of domestic NOLs will expire unused.\nThe Company records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount it believes is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers all positive and negative evidence to determine whether future taxable income will be generated during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance on the portion of the deferred tax assets, including current year losses, deemed not to have enough sources of income to utilize the future benefits.\nCOMSOVEREIGN HOLDING CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\n(Amounts in thousands) Balance at\nBeginning of\nPeriod Changes\n(credits) to\nexpense Changes\n(credits) to other\naccounts Write-offs Balance at\nEnd of\nPeriod\nDeferred tax valuation allowance\nDecember 31, 2022 30,378 13,644 (257 ) -\n43,765\nDecember 31, 2021 11,193 19,185 -\n-\n30,378\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various states and foreign jurisdictions.
