We entered the life sciences market in 2011, leveraging our in-house precision automation and cryogenics capabilities that we were then applying in the semiconductor manufacturing market. This led us to provide solutions for automated ultra-cold storage. Since then, we have expanded our life sciences offerings through internal investments and through a series of acquisitions. We now support our customers from research and clinical development to commercialization with our sample management, automated storage, and genomic services expertise to help our customers bring impactful therapies to the market faster. We understand the importance of sample integrity and offer a broad portfolio of products and services supporting customers at every stage of the life cycle of samples, including procurement and sourcing, automated storage systems, genomic services and a multitude of sample consumables, informatics and data software, along with sample repository solutions, referred to as SRS. Our expertise, global footprint, and leadership positions enable us to be a trusted global partner to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life sciences research institutions. In total, we employ approximately 3,500 full-time employees, part-time employees and contingent workers worldwide as of September 30, 2023 and have sales in approximately 150 countries. We are headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts and have operations in North America, Asia and Europe.\nOur Company was founded in 1978 and became a leading automation provider and partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. We divested the last of our semiconductor businesses in February 2022 for $2.9 billion in cash and since operate solely as a life sciences company. On December 1, 2021, we changed our corporate name from Brooks Automation, Inc. to Azenta, Inc. and our common stock started to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol AZTA. The semiconductor automation results are classified as discontinued operations, and, unless otherwise noted, the description of our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates solely to our continuing operations.\nOur portfolio includes product and service offerings developed by us internally, as well as through acquisitions, designed to bring together comprehensive capabilities to service our customers needs in sample exploration and management, automated storage, and genomic solutions. We continue to develop new product and service offerings and enhance existing and acquired offerings through the expertise of our research and development resources. We believe our acquisition, investment, and integration approach has allowed us to accelerate internal development and significantly accelerate time to market for our life sciences solutions.\nFor further information on our acquisitions, please refer to Note 4, Business Combinations to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLife Sciences Market\nOur businesses serve a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry to help our customers advance the development of therapies to improve peoples lives and cure diseases. With the advent of biologics and personalized\nmedicine, biological samples have become critical assets to the success of drug and therapy pipelines, and the proper management and protection of these samples are of increased importance to our customers. We believe this trend has created a sizable market opportunity for us to provide comprehensive sample management and genomic solutions.\nSince the successful mapping of the full human genome at the turn of this century, the market for genomic services has grown in support of research in biologic drug development, personalized medicine and cell and gene therapy (CGT). Top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and institutions can use their in-house laboratory resources to sequence millions of genes as part of their research workflow. Many companies and institutions, however, look to outsource all or a part of their gene sequencing to independent laboratories that provide expedited results and expert consultative services. We participate in this market as a value-added laboratory services provider, offering high quality genetic testing services with fast turnaround times.\nWe have approximately 13,000 customers globally and believe we are well positioned to expand our customer base. We serve top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the most advanced research hospitals performing clinical research and therapy development, as well as some of the newest and leading-edge start-ups in the biotech space. In addition, we also serve academic and government institutions. We believe that the sample-based services and products businesses will continue to demonstrate a growth trajectory and we do not observe cyclical demand for these offerings.\nSegments\nOur business is comprised of two reportable segments: Life Sciences Products and Life Sciences Services.

We have a network of 14 laboratories that provide genomic services, including eight in the United States, three in China, and one each in Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely on patents, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and procedures, copyrights, trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the life sciences and related process equipment industries, we believe that the improvement of existing technology, reliance upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Our policy is to require all employees to enter into proprietary information and nondisclosure agreements to protect trade secrets and know-how. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our trade secrets.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we owned approximately 94 issued U.S. patents, with various corresponding patents issued in foreign jurisdictions. We also had approximately 37 pending U.S. patent applications, with foreign counterparts of some of these applications having been filed or which may be filed at the appropriate time. Our patents will expire at various dates beginning in 2024 and running through 2039.\nEnvironmental Matters and Government Regulations\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. Federal environmental legislation in the United States that affects us includes the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.\nIn addition to these federal laws and regulations, various states have been delegated certain authority under the federal statutes and have authority over these matters under state laws. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.\nOther Laws and Regulations\nOur operations are also subject to other government regulations. While most of our products are not regulated, our acquisitions of Barkey and B Medical include certain products that are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\nOur businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury. In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and similar foreign agencies.\nWe believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental, employee health and safety and other government regulations, and such compliance has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nIn total, we employ approximately 3,500 full-time employees, part-time employees and contingent workers worldwide as of September 30, 2023, primarily in the United States. We understand that our success depends on our highly talented associates, and our human capital management practices focus on attracting and retaining a diverse and engaged workforce.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion. We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining diverse talent that is inclusive of every age, gender, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical capability, neurological difference, ethnicity, belief and perspective. Our goal is to develop cultural competency by seeking knowledge, increasing awareness, developing sensitivity, modeling respect and promoting inclusion and unity. Approximately 46% of our employees are gender diverse, and 42% of our U.S.-based employees identify as being racially diverse. Additional detail on our gender and racial diversity can be found on our website in our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) governance reports.\nEmployee Engagement. We are committed to fostering a culture and environment where every employee feels valued. Our success depends in large part on our hiring and retaining top talent across the entire organization, with primary emphasis on our management team and our employees who interface directly with our customers. We compete for talent with other companies both smaller and larger, and both in our market and in other industries.\nCompensation and Benefits. In order to attract and retain top talent, we focus on having a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, while offering competitive compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs.

We adhere to the governance requirements established by federal and state law, the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and we strive to establish appropriate risk management methods and control procedures to adequately manage, monitor, and control the major risks we may face day to day.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public over the internet at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. We also maintain a website at www.azenta.com, through which you can access our SEC filings. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. These are the risks and uncertainties applicable to our businesses that we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nMacroeconomic and External Risks\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health threats and epidemics, including COVID-19.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health threats and epidemics, including the ongoing global health concerns relating to COVID-19. Public health threats, whether global or not, may adversely impact our business and markets, including our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers, and business partners. In particular, we may experience material financial or operational impacts, including:\n\u25cf significant volatility or reductions in demand for our products and/or services; or\n\u25cf the inability to meet our customers needs or other obligations due to disruptions to our operations or the operations of our third-party partners, suppliers, contractors, logistics partners, or customers.\nThese impacts may be of greater magnitude in certain jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate that are impacted by these threats or react to the threats with more stringent policies.\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world economy and our business results and operations since 2020. The depth and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health threats may directly or indirectly\nimpact our business, results of operations, financial condition and individual markets in the future is dependent upon various factors, including the spread of additional COVID-19 variants or other health threats, the availability of vaccinations and other medical interventions, and government interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 or other health threats.\nWhile we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 and other health threats on our employees and our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts or that such efforts may not have detrimental unintended consequences, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nA prolonged downturn in macroeconomic conditions may materially adversely affect our business.\nAn economic downturn in the United States and elsewhere, including as a result of continued or future outbreaks of COVID-19 or a similar infectious disease, reductions in the level of government funding for scientific research, increases in interest rates, inflation, among other factors, may cause our current or potential customers to delay or reduce purchases, which could, in turn, result in reductions in sales of our products, materially and adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows. Volatility and disruption of global financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and proceed with planned or new capital spending initiatives, leading to a reduction in sales volume that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, a decline in our customers ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn may lead to increased difficulties in the collection of our accounts receivable, higher levels of reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nGlobal climate change and related legal and regulatory developments could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change presents risks to us and to our customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Our products and services are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations. Future regulations or voluntary actions on our part in response to climate change could result in costly changes to our facilities to reduce carbon emissions and could increase energy costs as a result of switching to less carbon-intensive, but more expensive, sources of energy to operate our facilities and to transport and ship products and samples. There can be no assurance that climate change or environmental regulation and response will not have a negative competitive impact on our ability to provide sample management, automated storage, and genomic services or that economic returns will match the investments that we are making in the development of new products and services. We will likely face increasing complexity related to product design, the use of regulated materials, energy consumption and efficiency, and the reuse, recycling, or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty regarding future incentives for energy-efficiency and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products and services, our costs associated with providing our products and services, and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in global weather patterns, which could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperature averages or extremes. These impacts may also adversely affect our properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact our significant foreign currency holdings, lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices for our products and services, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales, cost of sales and results of operations, and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices for our products and services to customers, which could result in lower net sales. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products and services in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations, including our margins, could be materially and adversely\naffected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold or these services are provided and the currency received in payment for such sales could be less valuable as compared to the U.S. dollar at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce currency exposure. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe hold approximately $546 million of cash and cash equivalents that is denominated in foreign currency, which represents a substantial portion of our current cash and cash equivalents balance. As a result of our significant foreign currency holdings, our financial results and capital ratios may be impacted by the movements in exchange rates, and a significant portion of our assets must be translated into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes or converted into U.S. dollars to meet our strategic needs, including with respect to our share repurchase authorization, and service obligations such as any future U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness or dividends. We may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, but our efforts may not be successful.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.\nThere has been an increased focus from investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, including addressing climate change, which may result in increases in our costs to operate our business or restrict certain aspects of our activities. The standards by which ESG efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time and the extent and severity of climate change impacts are unknown. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur operating results could fluctuate significantly, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur revenue, operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the timing and terms of product orders and service contracts by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise;\n\u25cf changes in the demand for the mix of products and services that we offer;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of any repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization;\n\u25cf timing and market acceptance of our new product and service introductions;\n\u25cf delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products or services, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers or the quality of such services;\n\u25cf new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors, which can, among other things, render our products and services less competitive due to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we provide products and services;\n\u25cf the timing and related costs of any acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions;\n\u25cf our ability to reduce our costs in response to decreased demand for our products and services;\n\u25cf our ability to accurately estimate customer demand, including the accuracy of demand forecasts used by us;\n\u25cf disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us;\n\u25cf write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures; and\n\u25cf increased investment into our infrastructure to support our growth, including capital equipment, research and development, as well as selling and marketing initiatives to support continuous product and services innovation, technological capability enhancements and sales efforts. The timing of revenue generation coupled with the increased amount of investment may result in operating losses.\nAs a result of these risks, we believe that reference to past performance for comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.\nIf we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely and effective manner, our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to respond to the technological changes present in the markets we serve. The success of our product development and introduction of products and services to market depends on our ability to:\n\u25cf identify and define new market opportunities, products and services in an accurate manner;\n\u25cf obtain market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u25cf innovate, develop, acquire and commercialize new technologies and applications in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u25cf adjust to changing market conditions;\n\u25cf differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings;\n\u25cf obtain and maintain intellectual property rights where necessary;\n\u25cf continue to develop a comprehensive, integrated product and service strategy;\n\u25cf price our products and services appropriately; and\n\u25cf design our products to high standards of manufacturability so that they meet customer requirements.\nIf we cannot succeed in responding in a timely and cost effective manner to technological and/or market changes or if the new products and services that we introduce do not achieve market acceptance, our competitive position would diminish which could materially harm our business and our prospects.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks.\nDuring fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 46%, 33% and 38% of our revenue was derived from sales outside of North America. We expect that international sales, including increased sales in Asia and Africa, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future, and that in particular, the proportion of our sales to customers in China will increase, due in large part to our significant genomic services operation in China. Additionally, we intend to invest additional resources in facilities in China, which will increase our global footprint of sales, service and repair operations. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf longer sales-cycles and time to collection;\n\u25cf tariff and international trade barriers;\n\u25cf fewer or less certain legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad;\n\u25cf different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u25cf government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u25cf an increased reliance on third-party agents and distributors to transact business in jurisdictions where we do not have a presence;\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, particularly in Asia and Europe;\n\u25cf political and economic instability, changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate; and\n\u25cf intervention or attempts to control our international operations by foreign governments, including our Suzhou China facility by the government of China.\nMoreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there is an increased risk of corruption and/or bribery, which could lead to violations of various laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While such business practices are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that all our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies and procedures, or the applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. Any such violations could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could materially harm our business and profitability.\nWe hold approximately $569 million of cash outside the United States and our ability to repatriate any of the funds for use in the United States or elsewhere in our business may be limited based on local country statutory requirements, which could negatively impact our opportunities to deploy capital, including for our share repurchase authorization.\nOur business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Our acquisitions, present numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf defining and executing a comprehensive product and services strategy;\n\u25cf managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of ours or of acquired companies;\n\u25cf unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target companys products or infringement of another companys intellectual property by a target companys activities, products or services;\n\u25cf problems associated with compliance with the acquired companys existing contracts;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;\n\u25cf the diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of the business; and\n\u25cf difficulties in accurately estimating the expected demand for any acquired product, service or technology and the timing and regularity thereof.\nIf we acquire a new business, we may expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. In periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. The failure to adequately address these risks or the impairment of any assets could materially harm our business and financial results.\nExpanding within current markets introduces new competitors and commercial risks.\nA key part of our growth strategy is to continue expanding within the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets. As part of this strategy, we expect to diversify our product sales and service revenue by leveraging our core technologies and making acquisitions of select businesses, products, services or technologies, which requires investments and resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets or identifying and successfully acquiring other businesses, products, services or technologies to meet all the needs of new customers and to compete favorably with other products and services. Because a significant portion of our growth potential may be dependent on our ability to increase sales within each of the Life Sciences Product and Life Sciences Services segments, our inability to successfully expand within the markets serviced by these segments may adversely impact future financial results.\nChanges in key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy.\nThe continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering, scientific and management personnel, together with our ability to attract and retain such personnel, is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy. There is substantial competition to attract such employees and the loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The same could be true if we were to experience a high turnover rate among engineering and scientific personnel and we were unable to replace them. Our ability to attract and retain employees may be negatively impacted by employees reactions to our health and safety policies, including those related to COVID-19 vaccinations, masks, and/or flexibility to work remotely, particularly in the United States. Any failure to attract, recruit, train, retain, motivate and integrate qualified personnel could materially harm our operating results and growth prospects.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our sample storage operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nUnexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our Life Sciences Services customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve and transport their critical samples, and these events could result in service disruptions, physical damage to one or more key storage facilities and the customer samples stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of service, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. Our primary storage facility is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, an area of the United States that can be prone to tornadoes and other severe weather events.\nIf our facilities were to experience a significant disruption in operations, our business could be materially harmed, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing facilities for our products and laboratories for our service offerings. If the operations at any one of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster, fire, power or other utility outage, work stoppage, war or terrorist activities or other similar event, our business could be seriously harmed because\nwe may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts, or provide services, to our customers in a timely fashion. The impact of any disruption at one of our facilities may be exacerbated if the disruption occurs at a time when we need to rapidly increase our capabilities to meet increased demand or expedited shipment schedules.\nMoreover, if actual demand for our products or services is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer component parts or other supplies than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of such parts or supplies. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if our customers reduce or delay orders, we may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on certain critical information systems and a failure or breach of such a system could harm our business and results of operations and, in the event of unauthorized access to a customers data or our data, incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks. However, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.\nConfidential information stored on these information systems could also be compromised. If a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any information regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may fraudulently attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $784.3 million of goodwill and $294.3 million in net intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions. We periodically review our goodwill and the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. These events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, advances in technology and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of October 1, 2023, the company reorganized the business under three operating segments, and as a result, reallocated goodwill to the newly defined reporting units. Subsequent to this reallocation, as of October 1, 2023, the fair value of the B Medical reporting unit approximates carrying value. In the event the performance of any of the Companys reporting units does not meet management expectations in the future, the Company experiences a prolonged macroeconomic or market downturn, or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions used in the analyses used to estimate fair value, the Company may be required to perform an impairment analysis which could result in an\nimpairment charge. For further details refer to Note 21, Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in tax rates or tax regulation could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the following: applicable tax laws; composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; and/or establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets based on the assessment of their realizability prior to expiration. Changes in applicable tax laws could significantly impact the estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, as well as expectations of future effective tax rates. Changes in tax laws could also negatively impact our ability to move our cash balances between the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our expense for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax (benefits) expenses and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational trade disputes could result in additional or increased tariffs, export controls or other trade restrictions that may have a material impact on our business.\nWe sell a significant number of products outside the United States, including in China and Africa. Based on the complex relationships among these countries and the United States, there is inherent risk that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact customer demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations, regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems and regulations relating to certain of our service offerings, including those described above under Item 1 Business-Environmental Matters and Governance Regulations above. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, change our service offerings, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards:\n\u25cf we could be subject to fines;\n\u25cf our production or shipments could be suspended; and\n\u25cf we could be prohibited from offering particular products or services in specified markets.\nAny of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations and customer demands related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use in components of our products of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining\ncountries, whether the components of our products are manufactured by us or third parties. This requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements and customer requests, such as costs related to our due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and preparing and filing required reports with respect thereto with the SEC. We may face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and/or free of numerous other hazardous materials.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations.\nOur ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and procedures, copyrights, trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products and services both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products, services, and technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our products and services are or may be developed, manufactured, provided, or sold may not fully protect our products and services. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the life sciences and related process equipment industries, we believe that the improvement of existing technology, reliance upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and the development of new products or services may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. To protect trade secrets and know-how, it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter into nondisclosure agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. Other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.\nThe expiration of our patents over time could lead to an increase in competition and a decline in our revenue.\nOne of our main competitive strengths is our technology, and we are dependent on our patent rights and other intellectual property rights to maintain our competitive position. Our current patents will expire from time to time beginning in 2024 and running through 2039 which could result in increased competition and declines in product and service revenue.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.\nThere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we do business. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. We cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end-users of our products and services resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions, whether or not proven to be true, will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products or services so that they no longer infringe the rights of others. We also cannot guarantee that licenses will be available or the terms of any licenses we may be required to obtain will be reasonable. Similarly, changing our products, services or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products and services. If a judgment of infringement were obtained against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products or offering certain of our services.\nFurther, the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial, even if we were to prevail. Any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nOur business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to continuously deliver key components of acceptable cost and quality.\nWe currently obtain many of our key components on an as-needed, purchase order basis from numerous suppliers. In some cases, we have only a single source of supply for key components and materials used in the manufacturing of our products. Further, a portion of our supply is sourced from Asia, including China and we do not always have a previous history of dealing with these suppliers. Our inability to obtain components or materials in required quantities or of acceptable cost and quality and with the necessary continuity of supply could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers. In addition, if a supplier or sub-supplier suffers a production stoppage or delay for any reason, including natural disasters or health-related threats, this could result in a delay or reduction in our product shipments to our customers. Any of these contingencies could cause us to lose customers, result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of certain key raw materials and natural resources used in our products and various manufacturing processes, and we rely on third parties to supply us with these materials in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to raw materials may be adversely affected if our suppliers operations were disrupted as a result of limited or delayed access to key raw materials and natural resources which may result in increased cost of these items.\nOur external service providers may fail to perform as we expect.\nOur external service providers have played and will continue to play a key role in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology and facilities management. Many of these service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage. These providers cloud computing systems may be susceptible to cyber incidents, such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, which are outside of our control. Although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform or adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches as we expect and any such failure could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Customers\nCustomers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time.\nSales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term commitments and contracts. Our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time. Accordingly, we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order.\nWe may face claims for liability related to damages of customer materials attributed to the failure of our products or services, exposing us to significant financial or reputational harm.\nOur automated cold storage systems for the life sciences sample management market are used in the handling, movement and storage of biological and chemical samples. We also provide sample storage services to customers where we store their biological and chemical samples or perform genomics services at our facilities. In any case, in addition to product warranty claims, inaccurate or faulty testing services or damage to our customers materials attributed to a\nfailure of our products or services could lead to additional claims for damages made by our customers and could also harm our relationship with our customers and damage our reputation, resulting in material harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Securities\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2022 through the end of fiscal year 2023, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $124.15 per share and a low of $36.45 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price may include:\n\u25cf variations in operating results from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations;\n\u25cf changes in the market price per share of our public company customers and competitors;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of any repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase authorization;\n\u25cf market conditions in the life sciences sample management and genomic services and other industries into which we sell products and services;\n\u25cf global economic conditions;\n\u25cf political changes, hostilities, public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar events, or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods;\n\u25cf low trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf the number of firms making a market in our common stock; and\n\u25cf actions of activist stockholders and our response(s) thereto.\nIn addition, the stock market has in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of life sciences companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAlthough we have initiated share repurchases under our share repurchase authorization, we cannot guarantee that our share repurchases will not limit our ability to further develop our business or whether the share repurchase authorization will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nOn November 4, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the 2022 Repurchase Authorization). Repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions (including under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement), or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization, and share repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time at our discretion.\nOn November 23, 2022, as part of the 2022 Repurchase Authorization, we entered into an ASR agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association for the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock. Approximately 6.1 million initial shares of common stock were received by us and retired in connection with entering into the ASR agreement in November 2022 and, in April 2023, the transactions under the ASR agreement terminated and we received final settlement of an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock for a total of 10.1 million shares of\ncommon stock repurchased under the ASR agreement. Following the final termination of the ASR agreement, other arrangements under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization commenced under which we expect to repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases, intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. We repurchased 17.5 million shares of common stock for $838.5 million (excluding fees, commissions, and excise tax) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 under the ASR agreement and these other arrangements. In addition, in November 2023, we announced that we intend to repurchase the remaining $500.0 million of shares of common stock available under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization in 2024. Our ability to continue to repurchase common stock, including under the other arrangements that commenced after termination of the ASR agreement and any of the remaining $500.0 million of the intended repurchases announced in November 2023, will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic investments, whether organic or through acquisitions, our results of operations, our financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant to a decision to repurchase common stock under the current arrangements.\nRepurchases pursuant to the 2022 Repurchase Authorization could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of the 2022 Repurchase Authorization could also cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such an authorization and could reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to further develop our business organically or through acquisitions or service any indebtedness we may incur in the future as a result of the reduction of our cash balances from the repurchases or otherwise. There can be no assurance that any repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although the 2022 Repurchase Authorization is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term price fluctuations could reduce the programs effectiveness.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected by securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could impact the trading price and volatility of our common stock and may constrain capital deployment opportunities and adversely impact our ability to expand our business.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or from continued stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder the execution of our business and growth strategy, constrain our capital deployment opportunities, and impact the price of our common stock. Stockholder activism, which can take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently. Volatility in the price of our common stock, our cash balance, our financial performance or other reasons may cause us to become the target of securities litigation or continue to be the target of stockholder activism.\nWe have been and may continue to be subject to stockholder activism, including relating to the actions of Politan Capital Management LP described in the Schedule 13D that it initially filed with the SEC on September 14, 2023, as amended, and may be subject to continued and other stockholder activism in the future. Securities litigation and stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert managements and our Board of Directors attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we have and may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist stockholder matters. Further, the price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and stockholder activism. In addition, stockholder activism may constrain our capital deployment opportunities and may limit the types of investments that are available to us.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of your shares.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings, requiring advance\nnotice in accordance with our by-laws for stockholder proposals that can only be acted upon at annual stockholder meetings and nominations to our Board of Directors, limiting the approval of changes in the number of directors to our Board of Directors or by a super majority vote of our stockholders and the potential for super majority votes of our stockholders in certain other circumstances. In addition, as discussed below, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nAlthough we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our designation and issuance of preferred stock, including in connection with the adoption of a stockholders rights plan, or poison pill, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\nOur by-laws designate the state courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors, officers and employees.\nOur by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of proceedings:\n\u25cf any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u25cf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or stockholders to our company or our stockholders;\n\u25cf any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws; or\n\u25cf any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware.\nThese choice of forum provisions will not apply to causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, our by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any claims under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters are currently located in Burlington, Massachusetts.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses. However, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that our assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time-to-time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.

We entered the life sciences market in 2011, leveraging our in-house precision automation and cryogenics capabilities that we were then applying in the semiconductor manufacturing market. This led us to provide solutions for automated ultra-cold storage. Since then, we have expanded our life sciences offerings through internal investments and through a series of acquisitions. We now support our customers from research and clinical development to commercialization with our sample management, automated storage, and genomic services expertise to help our customers bring impactful therapies to the market faster. We understand the importance of sample integrity and offer a broad portfolio of products and services supporting customers at every stage of the life cycle of samples including procurement and sourcing, automated storage systems, genomic services and a multitude of sample consumables, informatics and data software, along with sample repository solutions (SRS). Our expertise, global footprint and leadership positions enable us to be a trusted global partner to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences research institutions. In total, we employ approximately 3,500 full-time employees, part-time employees and contingent workers worldwide as of September 30, 2023 and have sales in approximately 150 countries. We are headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts and have operations in North America, Asia, and Europe.\nOur portfolio includes product and service offerings developed by us internally, as well as through acquisitions, designed to bring together comprehensive capabilities to service our customers needs in sample exploration and management, automated storage, and genomic solutions. We continue to develop new product and service offerings and enhance existing and acquired offerings through the expertise of our research and development resources. We believe our acquisition, investment and integration approach has allowed us to accelerate internal development and significantly accelerate time to market for our life sciences solutions.\nSegments\nOur business is comprised of two reportable segments, our Life Sciences Products segment and our Life Sciences Services segment. For further information on our reportable and operating segments, please refer to Note 19, Segment and Geographic Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Life Sciences Products business is a leading provider of automated cold storage solutions for biological and chemical compound samples. We have a complete line of automated storage systems from ambient temperatures to -190\u00b0C. Our sample management solutions include consumable vials and tubes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plates, instruments for supporting workflows, and informatics. This portfolio provides customers with a high level of sample quality, security, availability, intelligence and integrity throughout the lifecycle of samples providing customers with complete end-to-end cold-chain of custody capabilities. On July 1, 2022, we acquired Barkey Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (Barkey), a leading provider of controlled rate thawing devices for customers in the medical, biotech and pharmaceutical industries, headquartered in Leopoldsh\u00f6he, Germany. On October 3, 2022, we acquired B Medical Systems S.\u00e1 r.l and its subsidiaries (B Medical), a market leader in temperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions that enable the delivery of life-saving treatments to more than 150 countries worldwide. This acquisition complements our cold-chain capabilities, adding differentiated solutions for reliable and traceable transport of temperature-sensitive samples. Additionally, on February 2, 2023, we acquired Ziath Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Ziath), a leading provider of 2D barcode readers for life sciences applications to complement our product offerings.\nOur Life Sciences Services business is a leading provider of solutions addressing the many needs of customers in the area of genomic analysis and the management and care of biological samples used in pharmaceutical, biotech, healthcare, clinical, and academic research and development markets. We process millions of samples annually, each containing valuable information that must be preserved with the sample. Our genomic services provide a broad capability to customers for gene sequencing, synthesis, editing and related services. We offer a comprehensive, global portfolio that we believe has both broad appeal in the life sciences industry and enables customers to select the best solution for their research and development challenges. This portfolio also offers unique solutions for key markets such as cell and gene therapy (CGT), antibody development and biomarker discovery by addressing genomic complexity and throughput challenges. Our sample management services include off-site storage services, transport services, laboratory services, sample procurement, and interactive informatics solutions. We also offer expert-level consultation services to our clients throughout their experimental design and implementation processes. Our services also include short- and long-term sample storage and management of the cold-chain of custody from collection, to storage, to retrieving the sample which ultimately may go back into the research workflow.\nSale of the Semiconductor Automation Business\nOn February 1, 2022, we completed the sale of our semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee, Partners, L.P., for $2.9 billion in cash. In connection with the divestiture of the semiconductor automation business and our continued focus on our life sciences businesses, we changed our corporate name from Brooks Automation, Inc. to Azenta, Inc. and our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol AZTA on December 1, 2021.\nSince our founding in 1978, we had been a leading automation provider and partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. With the completion of the sale of the semiconductor automation business, we no longer serve the semiconductor market. The semiconductor automation business is classified as a discontinued operation and, unless otherwise noted, this MD&A relates solely to our continuing operations and does not include the operations of our semiconductor automation business.\nBusiness and Financial Performance\nOur performance for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nRevenue\n$\n665,072\n$\n555,498\n$\n513,703\nCost of revenue\n401,932\n299,914\n269,894\nGross profit\n263,140\n255,584\n243,809\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n33,956\n27,542\n22,412\nSelling, general and administrative\n316,282\n251,465\n252,101\nContingent consideration - fair value adjustments\n(18,549)\n-\nRestructuring charges\n4,577\nTotal operating expenses\n336,266\n280,319\n274,898\nOperating loss\n(73,126)\n(24,735)\n(31,089)\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income\n43,735\n20,286\nInterest expense\n-\n(4,589)\n(2,037)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n(632)\n-\nOther, net\n(1,042)\n(266)\n(16,475)\nLoss before income taxes\n(30,433)\n(9,936)\n(48,969)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(17,550)\n1,350\n(20,100)\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(12,883)\n$\n(11,286)\n$\n(28,869)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(1,374)\n2,144,145\n139,616\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(14,257)\n$\n2,132,859\n$\n110,747\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nRevenue increased 20% in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by revenue growth in our Life Sciences Products segment of 53% primarily due to acquisitions (largely B Medical), partially offset by the decline in COVID-related revenues in our Consumables and Instruments business. Gross margin was 39.6% for fiscal year 2023 compared to 46.0% in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the higher costs resulting from the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and intangibles associated with the acquisition of B Medical, and unfavorable mix in the Life Sciences Products segment, inclusive of margin dilution attributable to lower margins in the acquired B Medical business in the current year. Operating expenses increased $55.9 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.8 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the acquisitions of B Medical and Barkey, partially offset by an $18.5 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to B Medical. We generated an operating loss of $73.1 million for fiscal year 2023 compared to an operating loss of $24.7 million for fiscal year 2022, driven by a reduction in gross margin and an increase in operating expenses. Loss from continuing operations was $12.9 million during fiscal year 2023 as compared to a loss from continuing operations of $11.3 million in fiscal year 2022. Loss from discontinued operations was $1.4 million during fiscal year 2023 as compared to income from discontinued operations of $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2022. The results for discontinued operations for fiscal year 2023 were due to adjustments to and/or settlements of assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations. Please refer to the Results of Operations section below for a detailed discussion of our financial results for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, intangible assets, goodwill, inventories, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions, both in general and specifically in relation to the life sciences industry, that serve as a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily determinable based on information from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgment and thus have the most significant potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sale of products and services. A description of our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlthough most of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple performance obligations or non-standard terms and conditions. For customer contracts that contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction consideration to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract. We rely on either observable standalone sales or an expected cost-plus margin approach to determine the standalone selling price of offerings, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Performance obligations whose standalone selling price is estimated using an expected cost-plus margin approach relate to the sale of customized automated cold sample management systems and service-type warranties within the Life Sciences Products segment.\nRevenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, which primarily include automated cold sample management systems, is recognized over time as the asset created by our performance does not\nhave alternative use to us and an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is present. We recognize revenue as work progresses based on a percentage of actual labor hours incurred on the project to-date and total estimated labor hours expected to be incurred on the project. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. We have concluded that using the percentage of labor hours incurred to estimated labor hours needed to complete the project most appropriately depicts our efforts towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. We develop profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated from the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred in the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of required product customization and the work required to be able to install the product in the customers existing environment, as well as our historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control. We estimate a loss on a contract by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognize a loss during the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. We review profit estimates for long-term contracts during each reporting period and revise the estimate based on changes in circumstances.\nIf our judgment regarding revenue recognition proves incorrect, our revenue in particular periods may be adversely affected and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date.\nSignificant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration, as well as intangibles and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations may be based on, among other factors, estimates of revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs, obsolescence factor and discount rate among others attributable to completed technology and other acquired intangible assets used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as our current and future operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates and may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within our operating results.\nContingent consideration is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition using an appropriate valuation model, such as the Monte Carlo simulation model. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios, in which the model runs many simulations based on comparable companies growth rates and their implied volatility. Our estimates of forecasted revenues in the earn-out period include a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and other relevant factors. These cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate. Each quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and given the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded and could be materially different.\nIntangible Assets, Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe have identified intangible assets and generated significant goodwill as a result of our acquisitions. Intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimated future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present, at the reporting unit level. Intangible assets other than goodwill and long-lived assets are subject to impairment testing if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable.\nIn performing a quantitative test for impairment, either annually, or if required after initially assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events occurred indicating possible impairment (as described further in Note 2 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we determine fair values of our reporting units based on an income approach in accordance with the discounted cash flow method, (the DCF Method). The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates discounted to their present values. The key inputs used in the DCF Method include revenue growth rates, gross margin percentages, selling, general and administrative expense percentages and discount rates that are at or above our weighted average cost of capital. We derive discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective reporting units and our internally developed projections of future cash flows.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation, including managements best estimates of the reporting units future business activity and the related estimates and assumptions of future cash flows from the assets that include the associated goodwill. Different assumptions of revenue growth rates, gross margin percentages, selling, general and administrative expense percentages and the discount rate used in accordance with the DCF Method could result in different estimates of the reporting units fair value as of each testing date.\nIn the event the financial performance of either of the segments does not meet our expectations in the future, we experience a prolonged macro or market downturn, or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions used in our DCF Method, we may be required to perform additional impairment analyses and could be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge.\nWe are required to test long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment when impairment indicators are present. For purposes of this test, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If we determine that indicators of potential impairment are present, we assess the recoverability of the long-lived asset group by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group exceeds its future cash flows, we determine fair values of the individual net assets within the long-lived asset group to assess potential impairment. If the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less than their carrying values, an impairment loss is recognized for an amount in excess of the groups aggregate carrying value over its fair value. The loss is allocated to the assets within the group based on their relative carrying values, with no asset reduced below its fair value.\nWe were not required to test our long-lived assets for impairment during fiscal years 2023 or 2022 since no events indicating impairment occurred during the periods then ended.\nInventory\nWe state our inventory at the lower of cost or market and make adjustments to reduce the inventory cost to its net realizable value by providing estimated reserves for excess or obsolete inventory. The reserves are established for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions related to future demand and market conditions to reduce the carrying value to its net realizable value. We fully reserve for inventories and non-cancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. We perform periodic reviews of our inventory to identify excess inventories on hand. We compare on-hand inventory balances to anticipated inventory usage based on our recent historical activity and anticipated or forecasted demand for our products developed through our planning systems and sales and marketing inputs.\nWe adjust the reserves for excess or obsolete inventory and record additional inventory write downs based on unfavorable changes in estimated customer demand or actual market conditions that may differ from management projections.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider recent historical income, estimated future taxable income, carry-forward periods of tax attributes, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. We evaluate the realizability of\nour deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. We evaluate the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historic cumulative basis and on a forward-looking basis while performing this analysis. We continue to hold a U.S. valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain state tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards. We also maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign tax-paying components as of the end of fiscal year 2023.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. In addition, for stock-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals. Actual results, and future changes in estimates, may differ from our current estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements which is incorporated here by reference, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPlease refer to the commentary provided below for further discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results from operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. A comparison of our results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 is included in Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on November 25, 2022.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management adjusts the GAAP results for the impact of amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, purchase price accounting adjustments, and charges related to M&A to provide investors better perspective on the results of operations which the Company believes is more comparable to the similar analysis provided by its peers. Management also excludes special charges and gains, such as impairment losses, gains and losses from the sale of assets, certain tax benefits and charges, as well as other gains and charges that are not representative of the normal operations of the business. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single measure.\nRevenue\nOur revenue performance for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n% Change\nDollars in thousands\n2023 v. 2022\n2023 v. 2021\nLife Sciences Products\n$\n305,184\n$\n199,230\n$\n199,606\n53.2\n%\n52.9\n%\nLife Sciences Services\n359,888\n356,268\n314,097\n1.0\n%\n14.6\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n665,072\n$\n555,498\n$\n513,703\n19.7\n%\n29.5\n%\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nRevenue increased 20% in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by a 53% increase in our Life Sciences Products segment and a 1% increase in our Life Sciences Services segment.\nOur Life Sciences Products segment revenue increased 53% year-over-year, primarily due to acquisitions (largely B Medical). Excluding these acquisitions, we experienced a decline in revenue of approximately 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the decreased demand and associated revenue for COVID-19 related to our Consumables and Instruments business of approximately 28% year-over-year, which was partially offset by increased revenue in Automated Store Systems of approximately 20% year-over-year.\nOur Life Sciences Services segment revenue increased 1% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in our SRS business, partially offset by a decline in the Genomics Services business.\nWe estimate that revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $7.7 million in the aggregate, including $4.1 million from B Medical, as compared to COVID-related revenue of $22 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in this revenue was primarily due to lower demand for Consumables and Instruments related to COVID-19 testing.\nWe anticipate continued growth in revenue from our Life Sciences Products and Services businesses through our internally developed products and services and through our acquired businesses and potential future acquisitions.\nRevenue generated outside the United States amounted to $310.0 million, or 47% of total revenue, for fiscal year 2023 compared to $197.3 million, or 36% of total revenue, for fiscal year 2022. There was one customer with more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2023. This individual customer is a distributor shipping to end users in approximately 50 countries. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ending 2022.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nOur operating performance for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nLife Science Products\nLife Science Services\nYear Ended September 30,\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nRevenue:\n$\n305,184\n$\n199,230\n$\n199,606\n$\n359,888\n$\n356,268\n$\n314,097\nOperating income (loss):\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n(30,321)\n$\n11,033\n$\n21,971\n$\n(14,722)\n$\n10,784\n$\n10,289\nAmortization of completed technology\n13,194\n1,122\n1,117\n5,300\n6,202\n6,957\nPurchase accounting impact on inventory\n9,664\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAmortization of other intangibles\n1,567\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTariff adjustment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(484)\n5,497\nOther adjustments\n(1)\n-\n-\n(84)\nTotal adjusted operating income (loss)\n$\n(5,897)\n$\n12,155\n$\n23,094\n$\n(9,312)\n$\n16,847\n$\n22,659\nOperating margin\n(9.9)\n%\n5.5\n%\n11.0\n%\n(4.1)\n%\n3.0\n%\n3.3\n%\nAdjusted operating margin\n(1.9)\n%\n6.1\n%\n11.6\n%\n(2.6)\n%\n4.7\n%\n7.2\n%\nCorporate\nAzenta Total\nYear Ended September 30,\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nRevenue:\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n665,072\n$\n555,498\n$\n513,703\nOperating income (loss):\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n(28,083)\n$\n(46,552)\n$\n(63,349)\n$\n(73,126)\n$\n(24,735)\n$\n(31,089)\nAmortization of completed technology\n-\n-\n(1)\n18,494\n7,324\n8,073\nPurchase accounting impact on inventory\n-\n-\n-\n9,664\n-\n-\nImpairment of intangible assets\n-\n-\n13,364\n-\n-\n13,364\nAmortization of other intangibles\n28,207\n24,965\n29,299\n29,884\n24,965\n29,299\nTariff adjustment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(484)\n5,497\nRebranding and transformation costs\n(49)\n2,741\n(49)\n2,741\nRestructuring charges\n4,577\n4,577\nContingent consideration - fair value adjustments\n(18,549)\n-\n(18,549)\n-\nMerger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase(1)\n13,842\n17,329\n20,662\n13,842\n17,329\n20,662\nOther adjustments\n-\n(345)\n(5)\n(1)\n-\n(83)\nTotal adjusted operating income (loss)\n$\n(55)\n$\n(550)\n$\n1,182\n$\n(15,264)\n$\n28,452\n$\n46,935\nOperating margin\n(11.0)\n%\n(4.5)\n%\n(6.1)\n%\nAdjusted operating margin\n(2.3)\n%\n5.1\n%\n9.1\n%\n(1) Includes expenses related to governance-related matters.\nWe generated an operating loss of $73.1 million for fiscal year 2023 compared to an operating loss of $24.7 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating loss year-over-year was driven by lower gross margin at Life Sciences Services primarily due to macroeconomic uncertainty and pricing in the Genomics business, as well lower gross margin at Life Sciences Products primarily due to the acquisition of B Medical driving increased selling, general and administrative expenses and lower gross margin for the segment overall. Fiscal year 2023 included the impact of amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting impact on inventory due to the addition of B Medical. Within operating expenses, research and development expenses increased $6.4 million and selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $64.8 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the addition of B Medical, higher labor costs, and continued investment in the business. These increased expenses were partially offset by an adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration related to B Medical of $18.5 million and savings from cost reduction actions.\nOperating loss for our Life Sciences Products segment was $30.3 million for fiscal year 2023 compared to operating income of $11.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The Life Science Products segment adjusted operating income decreased $18.1 million and adjusted operating margin decreased 8.0 percentage points compared to the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was driven by an increase in operating expenses of $53.0 million (primarily due to the addition of B Medical), partially offset by higher adjusted gross profit of $33.9 million driven by increased revenues. Adjusted operating income for our Life Sciences Products segment excludes charges for amortization related to completed technology of $13.2 million and $1.1 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a $9.7 million charge related to the purchase accounting impact on inventory, and a $1.6 million charge related to amortization of other intangibles for fiscal year 2023. Please refer to Note 19, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.\nOperating loss for our Life Sciences Services segment was $14.7 million for fiscal year 2023 as compared to operating income of $10.8 million in the prior fiscal year. The Life Sciences Services segment adjusted operating income decreased $26.2 million and adjusted operating margin decreased 7.3 percentage points compared to the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was driven by lower adjusted gross profit of $5.3 million and an increase in adjusted operating expenses of $20.8 million. Adjusted operating income for our Life Sciences Services segment excludes charges for amortization related to completed technology of $5.3 million and $6.2 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a $0.5 million benefit from a tariff adjustment for fiscal year 2022. Please refer to Note 19, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.\nGross Margin\nOur gross margin performance for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nLife Science Products\nLife Science Services\nAzenta Total\nYear Ended September 30,\nYear Ended September 30,\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nRevenue\n$\n305,184\n$\n199,230\n$\n199,606\n$\n359,888\n$\n356,268\n$\n314,097\n$\n665,072\n$\n555,498\n$\n513,703\nGross profit\n101,192\n89,074\n92,560\n161,948\n166,523\n151,246\n263,140\n255,597\n243,806\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of completed technology\n13,194\n1,122\n1,117\n5,300\n6,202\n6,957\n18,494\n7,324\n8,074\nPurchase accounting impact on inventory\n9,664\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n9,664\n-\n-\nTariff adjustment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(484)\n5,497\n-\n(484)\n5,497\nOther unallocated corporate expenses\n-\n-\n-\n(1)\n(83)\n(1)\n(83)\nAdjusted gross profit\n$\n124,050\n$\n90,196\n$\n93,677\n$\n167,247\n$\n172,530\n$\n163,617\n$\n291,297\n$\n262,726\n$\n257,294\nGross margin\n33.2\n%\n44.7\n%\n46.4\n%\n45.0\n%\n46.7\n%\n48.2\n%\n39.6\n%\n46.0\n%\n47.5\n%\nAdjusted gross margin\n40.6\n%\n45.3\n%\n46.9\n%\n46.5\n%\n48.4\n%\n52.1\n%\n43.8\n%\n47.3\n%\n50.1\n%\nWe reported a gross margin of 39.6% for fiscal year 2023 compared to 46.0% in the prior fiscal year, a decrease of 6.4 percentage points. Gross margin decreased 11.6 percentage points in the Life Sciences Products segment and 1.7 percentage points in the Life Sciences Services segment for fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOur Life Sciences Products segment reported gross margin of 33.2% for fiscal year 2023 compared to 44.7% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and intangibles associated with the acquisition of B Medical. Cost of revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included $13.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of amortization related to completed technology. Fiscal year 2023 also included $9.7 million of purchase accounting impact on inventory. Excluding these charges, adjusted gross margin decreased 4.6 percentage points in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to the mix of products sold in our Cryogenics business, and margin dilution attributable to lower margins in the acquired B Medical business in the current year. Please refer to Note 19, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.\nOur Life Sciences Services segment reported gross margin of 45.0% for fiscal year 2023 compared to 46.7% in the prior fiscal year primarily driven by a decline in the Genomic Services business due to the impact of lower sales, higher labor costs and continued investment in the business. Please refer to Note 19, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10K.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expense for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nLife Sciences Products\n$\n20,934\n$\n14,633\n$\n10,866\nLife Sciences Services\n$\n13,022\n$\n12,909\n$\n11,523\nCorporate\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nTotal research and development expense\n$\n33,956\n$\n27,542\n$\n22,412\nLife Sciences Products Percent-Segment Revenue\n6.9\n%\n7.3\n%\n5.4\n%\nLife Sciences Services Percent-Segment Revenue\n3.6\n%\n3.6\n%\n3.7\n%\nCorporate Percent Revenue\n-\n%\n-\n%\n0.0\n%\nTotal Percent-Total Revenue\n5.1\n%\n5.0\n%\n4.4\n%\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.4 million in fiscal year 2023 as compared fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by a $6.3 million increase in our Life Sciences Products segments due to the addition of B Medical as well as an increase in product development expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expense for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nLife Sciences Products\n$\n110,579\n$\n63,408\n$\n59,723\nLife Sciences Services\n$\n163,648\n$\n142,830\n$\n129,398\nCorporate\n$\n42,055\n$\n45,227\n$\n62,980\nTotal selling, general and administrative expense\n$\n316,282\n$\n251,465\n$\n252,101\nLife Sciences Products Percent-Segment Revenue\n36.2\n%\n31.8\n%\n29.9\n%\nLife Sciences Services Percent-Segment Revenue\n45.5\n%\n40.1\n%\n41.2\n%\nCorporate Percent-Total Revenue\n6.3\n%\n8.1\n%\n12.3\n%\nPercent-Total Revenue\n47.6\n%\n45.3\n%\n49.1\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $64.8 million in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022, driven by higher costs in both our segments (largely in Life Sciences Products due to $41.5 million associated with B Medical), partially offset by savings from cost reduction actions.\nWithin our segment expense, discussed below, we allocate certain corporate general and administrative expenses including costs related to shared corporate functions which include finance, information technology, human resources, legal, executive, governance, and compliance. In total, corporate general and administrative expense allocated to segments increased $12.2 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher labor costs and investment in the business.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in our Life Sciences Products segment increased $47.2 million year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of B Medical.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in our Life Sciences Services segment increased $20.8 million year-over-year, primarily due to investments in the commercial organization.\nCorporate expenses decreased $3.2 million year-over-year primarily due to lower external professional service cost related to merger, rebranding, and transformation costs.\nNon-Operating Income (Expenses)\nInterest income - During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we recorded interest income of $43.7 million and $20.3 million, respectively, which primarily represented interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and net investment hedge. The increase in interest income in fiscal year 2023 from the prior fiscal year is due to higher interest rates on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the semiconductor automation business, including interest accrued on a net investment hedge during fiscal year ended 2023.\nInterest expense - During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we recorded interest expense of $0.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The interest expense for fiscal year 2022 is primarily related to interest on cash held in one of our German subsidiaries that is denominated in EUR, which carries a negative interest rate. There is no interest expense in 2023 as the interest rate was positive.\nOther expenses, net - During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we recorded other expenses, net of $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, primarily due to foreign exchange loss.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nWe recorded an income tax benefit on continuing operations of $17.6 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to an income tax expense of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2022. The increased tax benefit for the year was driven by the increased global pre-tax loss from operations recorded in fiscal year 2023. In addition to the tax benefit driven by the loss from operations, we also recorded a $1.4 million tax benefit from the reversal of tax reserves, a $1.4 million deferred tax benefit resulting from a tax rate reduction extension in our China business, and a $6.1 million tax benefit related to the outside basis difference in a German subsidiary. The benefit includes $8.1 million related to anticipated U.S. foreign exchange losses on the future repatriation calculated at foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2023. This benefit is offset by $2.0 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, it became apparent that the outside basis difference with regard to $450 million of foreign cash maintained in the German subsidiary would be reversed within the next twelve months. These additional tax benefits drove the effective tax rate on our loss higher than ordinary statutory tax rates.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations in fiscal year 2022 consisted of the semiconductor automation business. On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor automation business for $2.9 billion in cash.\nThere was no revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2023. Revenue from discontinued operations was $264.4 million for fiscal year 2022. Net loss from discontinued operations was $1.4 million for fiscal year ended 2023 and net income was $2.1 billion for fiscal year 2022. The net loss from discontinued operations was primarily driven by adjustments to liabilities related to discontinued operations, particularly the accrued liability for the litigation with Edwards Vacuum LLC which was recorded during second quarter of 2023 and is discussed in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Net income from fiscal year 2022 is comprised of the gain on the sale of the semiconductor business. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by our company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor automation business and semiconductor cryogenics business, and which remained as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $678.9 million, marketable securities of $450.2 million, and stockholders equity of $2.5 billion. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $17.5 million and ($466.0) million for fiscal years ending 2023 and 2022, respectively. We incurred a net loss of $14.3 million, and\nearned net income of $2.1 billion for fiscal years ending 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least one year from the date of this Annual Report on Form-10K and for the foreseeable future. The current global economic environment makes it difficult for us to predict longer-term liquidity requirements with sufficient certainty. We may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOverview of Cash Flows and Liquidity\nThe discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows is stated on a total company consolidated basis and excludes the impact of discontinued operations.\nOur cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 consist of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n678,910\n$\n658,274\nRestricted cash\n5,135\n383,023\nShort-term marketable securities\n338,873\n911,764\nLong-term marketable securities\n111,338\n352,020\n$\n1,134,256\n$\n2,305,081\nOur cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities were $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $684.0 million, of which approximately $569 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would need to repatriate these funds. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in significant U.S. federal income tax impacts. We had marketable securities of $450.2 million and $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022\nOverview\nYear Ended September 30,\nDollars in thousands\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n17,490\n$\n(466,046)\nNet cash provided by investing activities\n431,384\n1,465,590\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(844,080)\n(62,762)\nEffects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n37,955\n(180,819)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(357,251)\n$\n755,963\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $684.0 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2022. The decrease of $357.3 million was attributable to $844.1 million of cash outflows from financing activities, partially offset by $431.4 million of cash inflows from investing activities, and $17.5 million of cash inflows from operating activities.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and other charges impact reported cash flows.\nCash inflows from operating activities of $17.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, resulted from collections on accounts receivable, and efficient working capital management partially offset by payment of retention bonuses and cash settled stock-based awards, as well as state income taxes resulting from the sale of the semiconductor automation business.\nCash outflows from operating activities of $466.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, resulted from net income of $2.1 billion, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-operating items of $2.5 billion, and an increase in net operating assets of $507 million. This includes $431.6 million of taxes and $52.5 million of fees related to the sale of the semiconductor automation business. $72.1 million of cash outflows from the increase in net operating assets were primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaids and other assets partially offset by increases in accrued expenses, and accrued compensation and tax withholdings.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows provided by investing activities consist primarily of proceeds from divestitures, cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchase of marketable securities as well as cash proceeds generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities.\nCash provided by investing activities was $431.4 million during fiscal year 2023 and consisted of $1.1 billion of sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $236.2 million for purchases of marketable securities and $386.5 million paid for the acquisition of B Medical and Ziath.\nCash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal year 2022 and consisted of $2.9 billion of proceeds from the sale of the semiconductor automation business on February 1, 2022, net of the cash transferred, and $705.4 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities; offset by $2.0 billion of purchases of marketable securities, $125.9 million of acquisitions, and $73.4 million of capital expenditures. The acquisitions comprised the purchase of a technology intangible of $4 million related to the semiconductor automation business, $84 million for Barkey and $43 million to prepay the debt for the B Medical acquisition prior to September 30, 2022. Capital expenditures were made primarily to increase capacity, support new product development, and enhance information technology infrastructure.\nFinancing Activities\nCash outflows for financing activities were $844.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 which primarily consisted of cash outflows for our share repurchase authorization.\nCash outflows for financing activities were $62.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 which primarily consisted of cash outflows of $49.7 million to extinguish the term loan, $10.4 million for the payments of acquisition related contingent consideration, $7.5 million related to dividend payments, $0.4 million payment of finance leases, partially offset by $5.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nChina Facility\nIn April 2019, we committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of our genomic services business and provide infrastructure to support future growth. The facility is being constructed in two phases. As of fiscal year end 2023, we have completed the construction of phase one of the facility with a total cost of $43.0 million. Construction of phase two of the facility is expected to begin in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 and be completed over several years with a total estimated cost of $30.0 million.\nCapital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we have no outstanding debt on our balance sheet.\nDividends\nDividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service and capital requirements and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant.\nSince the completion of the sale of the semiconductor automation business on February 1, 2022, we have not paid a quarterly dividend and do not have plans to pay any dividends at this time. During fiscal year 2022, prior to the sale, we paid a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend totaling $7.5 million in December 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, our Board of Directors terminated the existing share repurchase authorization and approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the 2022 Repurchase Authorization). Repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions (including under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement), or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. We are not obligated to acquire any specific amount of common stock under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization, and share repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time at managements discretion. As part of the 2022 Repurchase Authorization, we entered into an ASR agreement for the repurchase of $500.0 million of our common stock on November 23, 2022, and received delivery of, and retired, 10.1 million shares of common stock under the ASR agreement, which terminated on April 3, 2023. In April 2023, other arrangements commenced under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization under which we expect to repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million of shares of our common stock in open market purchases, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. In addition, in November 2023, we announced that we intend to repurchase the remaining $500.0 million shares of common stock available under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization in 2024. We repurchased 17.5 million shares of common stock for $838.5 million (excluding fees, commissions, and excise tax) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 under the ASR and these other arrangements. As of September 30, 2023, $662.0 million of the 2022 Repurchase Authorization remained available for additional repurchases.\nSee Note 13, Stockholders Equity in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the section titled \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the share repurchase authorization.\nContractual Obligations and Requirements\nAt September 30, 2023, we had non-cancelable commitments of $73.5 million, including purchase orders for inventory of $51.3 million, and information technology related commitments of $22.2 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had no obligation, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term and long-term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Exposure\nOur cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consist principally of money market securities which are short-term in nature. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, our aggregate short-term and long-term investments were $450.2 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, and consisted mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities, and U.S. government backed securities. At September 30, 2023 and 2022 the unrealized loss position on marketable securities was $6.9 million, and $14.7 million, respectively, which is included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $11.7 million annual change in interest income earned in fiscal year 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had no outstanding debt on our balance sheet.\nCurrency Rate Exposure\nWe have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Most of these transactions carrying foreign exchange risk are in Germany, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and China. Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were 24% and 36%, respectively, of our total sales for fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. These sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries, which have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale.\nIn the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between our legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately $157.8 million and $80.4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and primarily relate to the Euro, British Pound, and the Chinese yuan. We mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within 30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency losses of $4.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate change of $9.0 million in our net income during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Azenta, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Azenta, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded B Medical Systems S.\u00e1 r.l. and its subsidiaries (B Medical) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during fiscal year 2023. We have also excluded B Medical from our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. B Medical is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from managements assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 5% and 17%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of B Medical Systems S.\u00e1.r.l. - Valuation of One Certain Completed Technology\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 3, 2022, the Company acquired B Medical for a purchase price of $432.2 million including contingent consideration. Of the acquired intangible assets, $100.6 million of completed technology was recorded, of which the majority was related to one certain completed technology. The fair value of the intangible assets was estimated using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. Significant judgment is used by management in determining fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Fair value may be based on valuations that utilize among other factors, revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs, obsolescence factor, and discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of one certain completed technology acquired in the acquisition of B Medical is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the one certain completed technology; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs, obsolescence factor, and discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over managements\nvaluation of the completed technology acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of one certain completed technology acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs, obsolescence factor, and discount rate. Evaluating managements assumptions related to revenue growth rates, operating expenses, and integration costs involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the B Medical business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the obsolescence factor and discount rate assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 20, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2016.\nAZENTA, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

Nature of Operations\nAzenta, Inc. (Azenta, or the Company) is a leading global provider of sample exploration and management solutions for the life sciences industry. The Company supports its customers from research and clinical development to commercialization with its sample management, automated storage, vaccine cold storage and transport, as well as genomic services expertise to help bring impactful therapies to market faster.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL). The Company determined that the semiconductor automation business met the held for sale criteria and the discontinued operations criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, (FASB ASC 205) as of September 30, 2021. Please refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations for further information about the discontinued businesses. The Consolidated Financial Statements were restated for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the semiconductor automation business and the semiconductor cryogenics business in accordance with FASB ASC 205. The discussion in the notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted, relate solely to the Company's continuing operations.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor automation business for $2.9 billion in cash.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all entities where it has a controlling financial interest and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Although these estimates are based on the Companys knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates are associated with recording accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, contingent consideration liabilities related to business combinations, long-lived assets, derivative financial instruments, deferred income taxes, warranty obligations, revenue over time, stock-based compensation expense, and other accounts. The Company assesses the estimates on an ongoing basis and records changes in estimates in the period they occur and become known.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which, assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets), and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nSignificant judgment is used in determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and contingent consideration, as well as identified intangible assets and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations may be based on valuations that utilize among other factors, estimates of revenue growth rates, operating expenses, integration costs, obsolescence factors, future expected cash flows and discount rates attributable to completed\ntechnology and other acquired intangible assets. When estimating the assumptions to be used in the valuation, the Company includes a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business, and other relevant factors. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within our operating results.\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from a change in the underlying inputs are recognized in results of operations until the arrangement is settled.\nForeign Currency Translation\nCertain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within Other income (expense) in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses totaled $4.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe determination of the functional currency of the Companys subsidiaries is based on their financial and operational environment and is the local currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency at period-end exchange rates, while revenue, expenses, gains and losses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translations are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets and presented as Foreign currency translation adjustments in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe semiconductor automation business had foreign operations which had a cumulative translation adjustment balance of $16.6 million at the date of disposal of this business. This amount was removed from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet during the three months ended March 31, 2022, and included within the gain on the sale of the semiconductor automation business in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result, the Company presented a $16.6 million reclassification adjustment in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2022.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company has transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Most of these transactions carry foreign exchange risk in Germany, the United Kingdom and China. The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations. The arrangements typically mature in three months or less and they do not qualify for hedge accounting. Net gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are recorded as a component of Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe fair values of the forward contracts are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Foreign exchange contract assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value based on observable market inputs and classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy described below due to a lack of an active market for these contracts.\nAll derivatives, whether designated as a hedging relationship or not, are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company must designate the hedging instrument as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation based on the exposure being hedged. Certain derivatives held by the Company are not designated as hedges but are used in managing exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nA fair value hedge is a derivative instrument designated for the purpose of hedging the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability resulting from a particular risk. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are both recognized in the results of operations and presented in the same caption in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nA cash flow hedge is a derivative instrument designated for the purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from a particular risk. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations.\nA hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is achieved through a derivative instrument designated for the purpose of hedging the exposure of changes in value of investments in foreign subsidiaries. If the derivative is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as a part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. Ineffective portions of net investment hedges are recognized in the results of operations.\nFor derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as gains or losses consistent with the classification of the underlying risk.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash deposits and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative instruments, and accounts receivable. All of the Companys cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities and derivative instruments are maintained by major financial institutions.\nThe Company invests cash not used in operations in investment grade, high credit quality securities in accordance with the Companys investment policy which provides guidelines and limits regarding investments type, concentration, credit quality and maturity terms aimed at maintaining liquidity and reducing risk of capital loss.\nThe Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and believes that it has adequately provided for exposure to potential credit losses. The Companys ten largest customers accounted for approximately 30%, 20% and 19% of its consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. One customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2023. This customer is related to the Life Science Products segment and is a distributor shipping to end users in approximately 50 countries. No customers accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company invests in marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Marketable securities reported as current assets represent investments that mature within one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term marketable securities represent investments with maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date.\nUnrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the security is sold or matures. Gains or losses realized from sales of marketable securities are computed based on the specific identification method and recognized as a component of Other income (expense) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company reviews the marketable securities for impairment at each reporting date to determine if any of the securities have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. The Company considers factors, such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company believes that an other-than-temporary decline in\nfair value has occurred, it writes down the investment to its fair value and recognizes the credit loss in earnings and the non-credit loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities, including cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration liability, and derivative instruments at fair value. The Company applies a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\n\u25cf Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset and liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\n\u25cf Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\u25cf Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities and reflect an entitys own assumptions in pricing assets or liabilities since they are supported by little or no market activity.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, as well as considering counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.\nThe Company measures certain assets, including the cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparable prices, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Cash equivalents are reported at fair value.\nThe Company classifies long-term restricted cash balances within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses\nTrade accounts receivable do not bear interest and are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses representing its best estimate of expected credit losses related to its existing accounts receivable and their net realizable value. The Company determines the allowance based on several factors, including an evaluation of customer credit worthiness, the age of the outstanding receivables, economic trends, historical experience and other information over the payment periods. The Company reviews and adjusts the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance for expected credit losses when the Company determines that the balances are not recoverable. Provisions for expected credit losses are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined on a first-in, first-out basis and include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company reports inventories at their net realizable value\nand provides reserves for excess, obsolete or damaged inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology and other economic factors.\nFixed Assets, Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed based on the straight-line method and charged to results of operations to allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\nBuildings\n10 - 40 years\nComputer equipment and software\n3 - 5 years\nMachinery and equipment\n2 - 7 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n5 years\nVehicles\n3 - 7 years\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining terms of the respective leases. Equipment used for demonstrations to customers is included in machinery and equipment and depreciated over its estimated useful life. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has developed software for internal use. Internal and external labor costs incurred during the application development stage of a project are capitalized. Costs incurred prior to application development and post implementation are expensed as incurred. Training and data conversion costs are expensed as incurred.\nLong lived assets and their associated accumulated depreciation are derecognized upon their retirement or at the time of disposal, and the resulting gain or loss is included in the Companys results of operations.\nThe Company identified finite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill as a result of acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are valued based on estimated future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful lives based on methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.\nFinite-lived intangibles assets and fixed assets are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. For purposes of this test, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the Company determines that indicators of potential impairment are present, it assesses the recoverability of long-lived asset group by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value, and an impairment loss is recognized in operating results to the extent any finite-lived intangible assets carrying value exceeds its calculated fair value. The future cash flow period is based on the future service life of the primary asset within the long-lived asset group.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, as follows:\nTrademarks\n5 - 13 years\nPatents\n8 years\nCompleted technology\n7 - 15 years\nCustomer relationships\n10 - 16 years\nNon-competition agreements\n5 years\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate and non-real estate and finance leases for non-real estate. The classification of a lease as operating or finance and the determination of the right-of-use asset (ROU asset) and lease liability are determined at lease inception. The ROU asset represents the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liability represents the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, an\nincremental borrowing rate is used based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Companys lease agreements may contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. Fixed payments for non-lease components are combined with lease payments and accounted for as a single lease component which increases the amount of the ROU asset and liability.\nThe ROU asset for operating leases is included within Other assets and the ROU asset for finance leases is included within Property, plant and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term lease liabilities for both operating leases and finance leases are included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The long-term lease liabilities for operating leases and finance leases are included within Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired by the Company. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if impairment indicators are present at the reporting unit level. The Company elected April 1st as its annual goodwill impairment assessment date. If the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that fair values of the reporting units are below their carrying values, the Company performs additional impairment tests during interim periods to evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation, including managements best estimate of future business activity and the related estimates of future cash flows from the reporting units that include the associated goodwill. These periodic evaluations could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair market values. Future business conditions and/or activity could differ materially from the projections made by management which could result in impairment charges.\nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below it, which is referred to as a component. The level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment of whether the operations below an operating segment constitute a self-sustaining business, in which case testing is generally performed at this level.\nThe Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines, based on this assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, management performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the reporting units fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWe determine fair values of our reporting units based on an income approach in accordance with the discounted cash flow method, (the DCF Method). The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates discounted to their present values. Terminal value represents the present value an investor would pay on the valuation date for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period. We consider the DCF Method to be the most appropriate valuation technique since it is based on managements long-term financial projections. In addition to determining the fair value of our reporting units based on the DCF Method, we also compare the aggregate values of our net corporate assets and reporting unit fair values to our overall market capitalization and use certain market-based valuation techniques to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values determined in accordance with the DCF Method.\nWarranty Obligations\nThe Company establishes reserves for estimated costs of product warranties based on historical information. Product warranty reserves are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized, and retrofit accruals are recorded at the time retrofit programs are established. The Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure and supplier warranties on parts delivered by the Company.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from the following sources:\n\u25cf Products, including sales of automated cold sample management systems, vaccine cold storage and transport systems, consumables, instruments, spare parts, and software.\n\u25cf Services, including repairs, upgrades, diagnostic support, installation, as well as biological sample services such as DNA sequencing, gene synthesis, molecular biology, bioinformatics, biological sample storage, sample acquisition, and other support services.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of such promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. Under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), revenue is recognized when, or as, the transfer of control of the underlying performance obligation occurs. To determine the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to and whether transfer of control has occurred, the Company applies the following five-step model:\n\u25cf Identify the contract with a customer. Contracts are accounted for when approval and commitment has been received from both parties, the rights of each party are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration to which the Company is entitled is probable. Contracts are generally evidenced through receipt of an approved purchase order or execution of a binding arrangement and can be both short and long-term. Long-term contracts within the segments relate to the sale of products with attached service-type warranty contracts that generally have a stated contract term that is greater than one year. Contracts may contain acceptance provisions where the Company is required to obtain technical acceptance from the customer upon completion of installation services and evidence of the systems functional performance within the customers operating environment. The Company has concluded that acceptance criteria within its contracts can be objectively evaluated and will not impact the Companys transfer of control assessment under ASC 606.\n\u25cf Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations include the sale of products and services. Certain customer arrangements related to the sale of automated cold sample management systems generally include more than one performance obligation and may include a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or service-type warranty obligations. These contracts include multiple promises and as a result, the Company is required to evaluate each promise and determine whether the promise qualifies as a performance obligation within the contract. Contracts may contain the option to acquire additional products or services at defined prices. The Company reviews the pricing of these options to determine whether the option would exist independently of the current contract. If the pricing of contract options provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into the current contract, the Company accounts for the option as a separate performance obligation.\n\u25cf Determine the transaction price. The transaction price of the Companys contracts with its customer is generally fixed, based on the amounts to be contractually billed to the customer. Although uncommon, certain contracts may contain variable consideration in the form of customer allowances and rebates that consist primarily of retrospective volume-based discounts and other incentive programs. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and included in the transaction price if it is probable that a subsequent change in the estimate would not result in a significant revenue reversal. The period between transfer of control of the\nperformance obligations within a customer contract and timing of payment is generally within one year. As a result, the Companys contracts typically do not include significant financing components.\n\u25cf Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For customer contracts that contain more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the total transaction consideration to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation within the contract. The Company relies on either observable standalone sales or an expected cost-plus margin approach to determine the standalone selling price of offerings, depending on the nature of the performance obligation. Performance obligations whose standalone selling price is estimated using an expected cost-plus margin approach relate to the sale of customized automated cold sample management systems, services, and service-type warranties.\n\u25cf Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring a product or service either at a point in time or over time, when the transfer of control of the underlying performance obligation has occurred. Control is evidenced by the customers ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the performance obligation. Revenue from third-party sales for which the Company does not meet the criteria for gross revenue recognition is recognized on a net basis. All other revenue is recognized on a gross basis. The Company excludes from the transaction price all sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities and as a result, revenue is presented net of tax.\nAs a result of applying this five-step model under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenues from its sale of products and services as follows:\n\u25cf Products: Revenue from the sale of standard products is recognized upon their transfer of control to the customer, which is considered complete at either the time of shipment or arrival at destination, based on the agreed upon terms within the contract. The Companys payment terms for the sale of standard products are typically 30 to 60 days.\nRevenue from the sales of certain products that involve significant customization, which include primarily automated cold sample management systems is recognized over time as the asset created by the Companys performance does not have alternative use to the Company and an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is present. The Company recognizes revenue as work progresses based on a percentage of actual labor hours incurred on the project to-date and total estimated labor hours expected to be incurred on the project. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment. The Company has concluded that using the percentage of labor hours incurred to estimated labor hours needed to complete the project most appropriately depicts the Companys efforts towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Company develops profit estimates for long-term contracts based on total revenue expected to be generated from the project and total costs anticipated to be incurred in the project. These estimates are based on a number of factors, including the degree of required product customization and the work required to be able to install the product in the customers existing environment, as well as the Companys historical experience, project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the contract related to implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within the Companys control. The Company estimates a loss on a contract by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs and recognizes a loss during the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews profit estimates for long-term contracts during each reporting period and revises the estimate based on changes in circumstances. Revenue for certain arrangements that involve significant product customization but do not provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date are recognized at a point in time, upon completion or substantial completion of the project, provided transfer of control has occurred. The project is considered substantially complete when the Company receives acceptance from the customer and remaining tasks are perfunctory or inconsequential and in control of the Company. Generally, the terms of long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work. In certain instances, payments collected from customers in advance of recognizing the related revenue are recorded and presented as contract liabilities within Deferred revenue on the Companys\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, due to certain billing constraints within contracts, the customer may retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract. In these contracts, an unbilled receivable is recorded when revenue recognized may exceed billings, which the Company presents as a contract asset on the balance sheet, which is included within the Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\u25cf Services: Service revenue is generally recognized ratably over time or on an output method, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of these services as they are performed. Payments related to service-type warranties may be made up front or proportionally over the contract term. Revenue for sample management and storage are recognized over the period the services are rendered or samples are stored. Revenue from genomic services is recognized over time and is based upon the fact that transfer of control takes place over time as determined using the input method of costs incurred. Payment due or received from the customers prior to rendering the associated services are recorded as a contract liability.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company receives government assistance from various domestic and foreign, local, regional and national governments which vary in size and duration in the form of cash grants or refundable tax credits. The government assistance typically specifies conditions that must be met in order for it to be earned, such as employee retention targets, completion of employee training, or the construction or acquisition of property and equipment and are often time bound. If conditions are not satisfied or if the duration period for the arrangement is not met, the government assistance is often subject to reduction, repayment, or termination.\nThe Companys policy is to recognize a benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other, net over the life of the asset or duration of the program when the Company has reasonable assurance that it will comply with the conditions under the government assistance and the government assistance will be received, refundable tax credits may also result in a reduction in Accrued income taxes payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If government assistance is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable by the Company in advance of completion of the conditions, the government assistance is recognized in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.\nIn fiscal year 2023, approximately $4.3 million of government assistance was recognized in Other, net and approximately $0.9 million was recognized as a reduction to Cost of Revenue - Products in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company also received advance cash government assistance of $6.6 million, of which $4.7 million is recognized within Other long-term liabilities, and $1.9 million is recognized within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Furthermore, the Company anticipates receipt of $0.6 million of additional government assistance, recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of personnel expenses related to development of new products, as well as enhancements and engineering changes to existing products and development of hardware and software components.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of the Companys common stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant. For awards that vest based on service conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that vest subject to performance conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense ratably over the performance period if it is probable that performance condition will be met and adjusts for the percentage of shares probable of achieving the performance goals. Each quarter, management assesses the probability of achieving the performance goals. The Company makes estimates of stock award forfeitures and the number of awards expected to vest. The Company considers many factors in developing forfeiture estimates, including\naward types, employee classes and historical experience. Current estimates may differ from actual results and future changes in estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements contain certain deferred tax assets that were recorded as a result of operating losses, as well as other temporary differences between financial and tax accounting. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets if, based upon the evaluation of positive and negative evidence and the extent to which that evidence is objectively verifiable, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the Companys income tax (benefit) expense, the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nThe calculation of the Companys income tax liabilities involves consideration of uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon an audit conducted by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If the Company determines that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained, the second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company re-evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors, such as changes in facts or circumstances, tax law, new audit activity and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. A change in recognition or measurement may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax expense.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic income or loss per share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income or loss per share is determined by dividing net income by diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted weighted average shares reflect the dilutive effect, if any, of potential common shares. To the extent their effect is dilutive, employee equity awards and other commitments to be settled in common stock are included in the calculation of diluted income or loss per share based on the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the calculation of dilutive weighted average shares outstanding if their effect would be anti-dilutive at the balance sheet date based on a treasury stock method or due to a net loss.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. The ASUs provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The provisions of the ASUs were only available until December 31, 2022, when the reference rate replacement activity was expected to be completed. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, extending the relief offered in this series of ASUs through December 31, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. There is no significant accounting impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as a result of the adoption of these ASUs.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. The amendment in this ASU requires disclosures to increase the transparency of transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entitys financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this guidance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 on a prospective basis. The adoption of the ASU did not impact the Companys recording or reporting of such amounts in the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Government Assistance for the required disclosures resulting from adoption of this ASU.\nIn June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of this ASU on October 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n3. Discontinued Operations\nDisposition of the Semiconductor Automation Business\nOn September 20, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (THL) and the Company determined that the semiconductor automation business met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and, as a result, its historical financial results are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and assets and liabilities were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale. On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the semiconductor automation business for $2.9 billion in cash. As part of the transaction, the Company recorded an $18.1 million liability related to retention bonuses and cash settled stock-based awards for former employees of the Company that were conveyed with the transaction. The Company paid $0.6 million of these payments during the year ended September 30, 2022 and remitted the remaining payments to THL in November 2022, and THL directly paid the Companys former employees. Following the completion of the sale, the Company no longer serves the semiconductor market.\nIn connection with the closing of the sale, the Company and THL entered into a transition services agreement under which both the Company and THL provide each other certain transition services related to finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, compliance, facilities, legal and research and development support, for time periods ranging from three to 24 months. In addition, the Company agreed to lease back a portion of the facilities in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, that were sold to THL as part of the sale agreement. The leases are 24 months but may be terminated earlier by the Company upon 90 days notice to THL. As of September 30, 2023, one of the two original leases is still in effect. The transition services and lease agreements approximate fair value and do not have a material impact on the Companys financial results or operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a $1.4 million loss on divestiture. The following table presents the financial results of automation business discontinued operations with respect to the automation business (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenue\nProducts\n$\n244,962\n$\n624,358\nServices\n19,468\n55,698\nTotal revenue\n264,430\n680,056\nCost of revenue\nProducts\n141,165\n354,786\nServices\n11,159\n29,750\nTotal cost of revenue\n152,324\n384,536\nGross profit\n112,106\n295,520\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n18,486\n48,647\nSelling, general and administrative\n30,622\n70,634\nRestructuring charges\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n49,108\n119,511\nOperating income\n62,998\n176,009\nGain on divestiture\n2,561,820\nIncome before income taxes\n2,624,818\n176,142\nIncome tax expense\n480,673\n35,357\nNet income from discontinued operations\n$\n2,144,145\n$\n140,785\nThe following table presents the significant non-cash items and capital expenditures for the discontinued operations with respect to the semiconductor automation business that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n-\n$\n8,472\nCapital expenditures\n2,862\n6,414\nStock-based compensation\n-\n7,405\nThere were no significant non-cash items and or capital expenditures related to discontinued operations in 2023.\n4. Business Combinations\nThe Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the following acquisitions at their fair values as of the acquisition date, from a market participants perspective. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, its estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement. Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Companys results of operations. The measurement period to finalize the fair values is completed within one year after the respective acquisition date.\nAcquisitions Completed in Fiscal Year 2023\nZiath Ltd\nOn February 2, 2023, the Company acquired Ziath, Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Ziath). Based in Cambridge, United Kingdom, Ziath is a leading provider of 2D barcode readers for life science applications. Founded in 2005, Ziaths innovative 2D barcode readers are a key component of the laboratory automation workflow serving pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic customers worldwide. Ziath will enhance the Companys offerings, which support the entire lifecycle of sample management from specimen collection to sample registration, storage and processing. The acquisition was completed at a purchase price of $16.0 million, net of cash acquired. The acquired business is included in the Life Sciences Products segment.\nThe allocation of the consideration included $12.0 million of goodwill, $4.1 million of technology, $1.1 million of deferred tax liability, $0.6 million of customer relationships, $0.3 million of trademarks, and several other assets and liabilities. The weighted average life of completed technology is 10 years, customer relationships is 13 years, and trademarks is 13 years. The goodwill represents the Companys ability to provide a differentiated technology enabling high throughput scanning of varied formats of consumables. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company did not present pro forma financial information for its consolidated results of operations for the acquisition because such results are immaterial.\nB Medical Systems S.\u00e1. r.l.\nOn October 3, 2022, the Company acquired B Medical Systems S.\u00e1 r.l. and its subsidiaries (\"B Medical\"), for a purchase price of $432.2 million including contingent consideration, which the Company estimated to be $17.0 million as of the measurement date. B Medical is a market leader in temperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions that enables the delivery of life-saving treatments to more than 150 countries worldwide. B Medicals results of operations are reported in the Companys Life Sciences Products segment from the date of acquisition. The Company paid a total initial cash purchase price at closing of $424.0 million, as adjusted for cash acquired and other items pursuant to the acquisition agreement. B Medical Systems Holdings S.A (the Seller) was eligible to earn up to \u20ac50.0 million in contingent consideration based upon achievement of certain financial metrics by B Medical. The Company repaid B Medicals outstanding debt of $43.1 million prior to September 30, 2022 which was included in the purchase price and was classified in prepaid assets as of September 30, 2022. In addition, the Company recorded $381.0 million in short-term restricted cash as of September 30, 2022, which was reserved to complete the acquisition which occurred on October 3, 2022.\nThe contingent consideration payment from the Company to the Seller was based on achievement of certain revenue targets over the one-year period from October 3, 2022 to September 30, 2023. The Company recorded the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates revenue projections, revenue growth rates of comparable companies, implied volatility and a risk adjusted discount rate. Each quarter, the Company was required to remeasure the fair value of this liability as assumptions changed over time and any resulting adjustments in the fair value of this liability were recorded in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement. This fair value measurement was directly impacted by the Companys estimate of future incremental revenue growth of the business. Accordingly, if actual revenue growth was higher or lower than the estimates within the fair value measurement, the Company would record additional charges or gains. This liability was revalued from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to zero as of June 30, 2023.\nThe purchase price was allocated to B Medicals tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of October 3, 2022, as set forth below (in thousands):\nFair Value\nAccounts receivable\n$\n19,549\nInventory\n51,978\nOther assets\n10,769\nProperty plant and equipment\n54,149\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets:\nCompleted technology\n100,600\nTrademarks\n5,500\nCustomer relationships\n36,700\nBacklog\nOther liabilities\n(32,533)\nDeferred income taxes, net\n(43,393)\nGoodwill\n228,241\nTotal purchase price, net of cash acquired\n$\n432,160\nDuring the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 the Company recorded adjustments which resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $9.2 million since the initial preliminary purchase price allocation. These adjustments include a $1.0 million decrease to property, plant and equipment, a $0.4 million increase to intangible assets, a $9.6 million decrease to other assets, a $2.3 million increase to inventory, a $0.8 decrease in other liabilities, and a $0.4 million decrease to deferred taxes.\nIn performing the purchase price allocation, the Company considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, and historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of B Medicals business. As part of the purchase price allocations, the Company determined the identifiable intangible assets were completed technology value, trademarks, customer relationships and backlog. The fair value of the intangible assets was estimated using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, and the cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of 13%. The cash flows were based on estimates used to price the transaction, and the discount rate applied was benchmarked to the implied rate of return from the transaction and the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average life of completed technology is 10 years, customer relationships is 16 years, trademarks is five years and backlog is one year. The intangible assets acquired are amortized over their respective weighted average life using methods that approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized. The calculation of the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired was recorded to goodwill. Goodwill of $228.2 million largely reflects the potential expansion of the Company's cold chain capabilities in the Companys Life Sciences Products segment by adding differentiated solutions for reliable and traceable transport of temperature-controlled specimens. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe following financial information reflects our consolidated results from B Medical (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenue\n$\n113,122\nNet loss\n$\n(26,463)\nThe Company incurred $4.9 million and $4.0 million in transaction costs recognized in earnings and presented within Selling, general and administrative in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the acquisition for fiscal years ending 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects our consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition had taken place on October 1, 2021 (in thousands). The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that we would have reported had the transaction occurred at the beginning of these periods nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenue\n$\n665,072\n$\n672,151\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(5,356)\n$\n2,111,185\nTo present our consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition had taken place on October 1, 2021, the unaudited pro forma earnings for the fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022 have been adjusted to exclude $5.3 million and include $23.2 million, respectively, of property, plant and equipment, inventory, and intangible asset step-up depreciation and amortization expense. Non-recurring acquisition related items and significant GAAP adjustments in the fiscal years ending 2023 and 2022 exclude $3.6 million and include $4.9 million, respectively, of transaction costs, net. Additional adjustments for fiscal year ended 2022 exclude $6.1 million of debt interest expense, include $1.1 million expense of capitalized research and development costs, and include a $6.4 million tax benefit adjustment. The pro forma financial information does not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the integration of B Medical. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations.\nAcquisition Completed in Fiscal Year 2022\nBarkey Holding GmbH\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company acquired Barkey Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (Barkey), a leading provider of controlled-rate thawing devices for customers in the medical, biotechonlogy and pharmaceutical industries, head quartered in Leopoldsh\u00f6he, Germany.

S. dollar and the Euro. Under the terms of the cross-currency swap agreement, the Company notionally exchanged $1.0 billion for \u20ac915.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.20%. The designated notional amount was $960.0 million, and the actual interest rate was 1.28%. The 1.28% rate was in the range of the market value for that day and was the true interest rate on the notional amount. The Company designated the cross-currency swap as a hedge of net investments against one of its Euro denominated subsidiaries requiring an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity. At the maturity of the cross currency-swap on February 1, 2023, the Company delivered a notional amount of \u20ac852.0 million and received a notional amount of $960.0 million at an USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.13, which included realization of a gain of $29.3 million recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn February 1, 2023, the Company entered into another cross-currency swap agreement to hedge the variability of exchange rate impacts between the U.S. dollar and the Euro.

Stockholders Equity\nShare Repurchases\nOn November 4, 2022, the Companys Board of Directors terminated the Companys then existing $50.0 million share repurchase authorization and approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of shares of the Companys common stock from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions (including under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement), or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. The repurchase authorization can be discontinued at any time.\nOn November 23, 2022, the Company executed an ASR agreement (the ASR Agreement) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the Dealer) to repurchase an aggregate of up to $500.0 million of the Companys common stock. Under the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company made a payment of $500.0 million to the Dealer on November 28, 2022 and received an initial delivery of 6.1 million shares of common stock from the Dealer, representing approximately 70% of the total shares of common stock that were expected to be repurchased under the ASR Agreement. The final number of shares repurchased by the Company was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the Companys common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement. The final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement occurred in April 2023, and the Company received 4.0 million additional shares of common stock from the Dealer as of the settlement date.

Following the final termination of the ASR Agreement in April 2023, other arrangements commenced under which the Company expects to repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million shares of common stock in open market purchases, subject to market and business conditions, legal requirements, and other factors. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has acquired 7.4 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases totaling $338.5 million (excluding fees, commissions, and excise tax) under these other arrangements. These shares of common stock repurchased by the Company were retired, accounted for as a reduction to stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share as of the applicable settlement dates.\nEffective January 1, 2023, all corporate share repurchases are subject to a one percent excise tax on the value of the repurchase, net of share issuances, subject to certain exclusions. The excise tax was part of The Inflation Reduction Act passed by the U.S. government in 2022.

No shares have subsequently been granted to employees who belong to the discontinued operations.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants\nRestricted stock units granted with a required service period typically have three-year vesting schedules in which one-third of awards vest at each annual anniversary of grant date, subject to the award holders meeting service requirements.\nCertain members of the Board of Directors have elected to defer receiving their annual stock awards and related quarterly dividends, if any, until they attain a certain age or cease to provide services as a member of the Companys Board of Directors. Annual deferred stock awards granted during fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 vested upon issuance.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants\nPerformance-based restricted stock units are earned based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The criteria for performance-based awards are weighted and have threshold, target and maximum performance goals.\nPerformance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in fiscal year 2023, 2022 and 2021 allow participants to earn 100% of restricted stock units if the Companys performance meets or exceeds its target goal for each applicable financial metric, and up to a maximum of 200% if the Companys performance for such metrics meets or exceeds the maximum or stretch goal. Performance below the minimum threshold for each financial metric results in award forfeiture. Performance goals are measured over a three-year period for each years restricted stock unit awards and at the end of the period to determine the number of restricted stock units earned, if any, by recipients who continue to meet the service requirement. Upon the third anniversary of each years restricted stock unit awards grant date, the Companys Board of Directors determines the number of restricted stock units earned for participants who continue to meet the service requirements on the vest date.\nAwards Granted to the Board of Directors\nThe stock-based compensation granted to members of the Companys Board of Directors includes common stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and deferred common stock and restricted stock unit awards.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan that allows its employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the Companys stock at the beginning or the end of the semi-annual offering period, whichever is lower. On February 8, 2017, the stockholders approved the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan allows for purchases by employees of up to 1,250,000 shares of the Companys common stock. As of September 30, 2023, 586,421 shares of common stock remain available for purchase under the Plan. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued 83,715 shares and 82,035 shares, respectively, under the Plan.\nValuation Assumptions for an Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated on the commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended September 30,\nRisk-free interest rate\n5.2\n%\n1.7\n%\n0.3\n%\nVolatility\n%\n%\n%\nExpected life\n6 months\n6 months\n6 months\nDividend yield\n-\n%\n-\n%\n0.6\n%\nThe risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for notes with terms approximating the expected life of the shares granted. The expected stock price volatility is determined based on the Companys historic stock prices over a period commensurate with the expected life of the shares granted. The expected life represents the weighted average period over which the shares are expected to be purchased. Dividend yields are projected based on the Companys history of dividend declarations and managements intention for future dividend declarations.\n16. Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables summarize assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2023\nDescription\nTotal Fair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents\n$\n525,952\n$\n525,952\n$\n-\n$\n-\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n450,211\n85,949\n364,262\n-\nForeign exchange contracts\n-\n-\nNet investment hedge\n13,036\n-\n13,036\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n989,243\n$\n611,901\n$\n377,342\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts\n-\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\nAs of September 30, 2022\nDescription\nTotal Fair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets:\nCash equivalents\n$\n374,804\n$\n374,055\n$\n$\n-\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n1,263,782\n651,800\n611,982\n-\nForeign exchange contracts\n-\n-\nNet investment hedge\n124,789\n-\n124,789\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n1,764,009\n$\n1,025,855\n$\n738,154\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n-\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of money market funds and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. The Company considers all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.\nAvailable-For-Sale Securities\nAvailable-for-sale securities primarily consist of highly rated corporate debt securities and U.S. government backed securities which are classified as Level 1. Investments classified as Level 2 consist of debt securities that are valued using matrix pricing and benchmarking because they are not actively traded, and bank certificates of deposit. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices.\nForeign Exchange Contracts & Net Investment Hedge\nOur foreign exchange contract assets and liabilities, and our net investment hedge assets are measured and reported at fair value using the market method valuation technique. The inputs to this technique utilize current foreign currency exchange forward market rates published by third-party leading financial news and data providers. These are observable data that represent the rates that the financial institution uses for contracts entered into at that date; however, they are not based on actual transactions, so they are classified as Level 2.\nContingent Consideration Liability\nThe contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of B Medical is measured and reported at fair value using the real options method based on the unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value and classified with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The contingency was based on the acquired business performance through September 30, 2023. Please refer to Note 4, Business Combinations for further details. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration resulting from a change in the underlying inputs are recognized in results of operations until the arrangement is settled. This liability was revalued from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2022 to zero as of June 30, 2023, with the offset to the changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no changes to the measurement of the contingent consideration liability in the fourth quarter.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nDuring fiscal year 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any material fair value measurements for assets or liabilities on a nonrecurring basis.\n17. Income Taxes\nThe components of the income tax (benefit) expense from continuing operations for the fiscal years are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nCurrent income tax (benefit) expense\nFederal\n$\n(599)\n$\n(4,826)\n$\n(14,247)\nState\n1,528\n(867)\nForeign\n9,757\n4,627\n15,484\nTotal current income tax (benefit) expense\n10,686\nDeferred income tax (benefit) expense:\nFederal\n(18,684)\n(815)\n(11,469)\nState\n(402)\n(180)\n(2,283)\nForeign\n(9,150)\n1,937\n(6,718)\nTotal deferred income tax (benefit) expense\n(28,236)\n(20,470)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n$\n(17,550)\n$\n1,350\n$\n(20,100)\nThe components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the fiscal years are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nDomestic\n$\n(58,065)\n$\n(39,392)\n$\n(88,763)\nForeign\n27,632\n29,456\n39,794\nLoss before income taxes\n$\n(30,433)\n$\n(9,936)\n$\n(48,969)\nThe differences between the income tax (benefit) expense on income (loss) from continuing operations and income taxes computed using the applicable U.S. statutory federal tax rates for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nIncome tax benefit computed at federal statutory rate\n$\n(6,331)\n$\n(2,086)\n$\n(10,284)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n(851)\n(776)\n(1,005)\nForeign income taxed at different rates\n(22)\n(1,182)\n(2,594)\nImpact of investments in subsidiaries\n(6,058)\n-\n7,128\nNontaxable gain from acquisition earn-out liability reversal\n(3,959)\n-\n-\nChange in deferred tax asset valuation allowance\n1,137\n1,337\n(3,247)\nImpact of change in uncertain tax positions\n(1,321)\n(358)\n(10,607)\nGlobal intangible low taxed income, net of foreign tax credits\n-\n4,060\n4,051\nImpact of tax rate changes\n(1,391)\n1,531\nCompensation\n1,598\n(1,199)\nTax credits\n(1,434)\n(2,102)\n(4,050)\nMerger costs\n1,056\n1,629\nOther non-deductible expenses and other taxes\n1,304\nImpact of effective state tax rate change\n-\n-\nResearch and development expense deduction\n(1,278)\n(910)\n(730)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n$\n(17,550)\n$\n1,350\n$\n(20,100)\nThe Company recorded net deferred tax assets in the amount of $6.1 million related to its outside basis difference in a German subsidiary. The benefit includes $8.1 million related to U.S. foreign exchange losses on the future repatriation calculated at foreign exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. This benefit is offset by $2.0 million of state income taxes, net of the federal benefit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, it became apparent that the basis difference with regard to $450 million of foreign cash maintained in the German subsidiary would reverse within the next twelve months based on significant capital needs.\nThe Company has not provided deferred income taxes on the outside basis differences of any other foreign subsidiary and maintains its general assertion of indefinite reinvestment regarding those subsidiaries and the remaining earnings of its German subsidiary as of September 30, 2023. The remaining foreign earnings are expected to be reinvested in foreign operations and acquisitions. Including the expected remittance noted previously, unremitted foreign earnings total approximately $1.3 billion. The Company did not calculate estimated deferred tax liabilities on the remaining earnings because such calculations would not be practicable due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation. The taxes on these earnings would primarily consist of foreign withholding taxes, taxes on foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from potential future distributions, and U.S. state income taxes. Substantially all of the unremitted earnings of the Company have been taxed in the U.S. based on the international tax regulations.\nThe significant components of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible\n$\n10,426\n$\n9,704\nFederal, state and foreign tax credits\n-\nOther assets\n1,095\nEquity compensation\n2,183\n3,508\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n9,692\n7,397\nLease liabilities\n17,513\n14,700\nCapitalized research and development\n6,807\n-\nDeferred revenue\n3,672\n3,609\nOutside basis differences in subsidiaries\n6,058\nDeferred tax assets\n57,121\n40,013\nDepreciation and intangible amortization\n(97,572)\n(56,856)\nRight-of-use assets\n(16,632)\n(14,146)\nOther liabilities\n(317)\n(402)\nNet unrealized gain on hedging and investments\n(1,574)\n(27,144)\nDeferred tax liabilities\n(116,095)\n(98,548)\nValuation allowance\n(8,348)\n(5,927)\nNet deferred tax asset (liability)\n$\n(67,322)\n$\n(64,462)\nThe deferred tax assets on the balance sheets for September 30, 2023 and 2022 also include $0.6 million and $1.1 million deferred tax charge related to the companys intercompany profit elimination, respectively.\nASC Topic 740 requires that all available evidence, both positive and negative, be considered in determining, based on the weight of that evidence, whether a valuation allowance is needed. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or the entire deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is considered a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an annual and quarterly basis. The Company evaluates the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historical cumulative basis and a forward-looking basis in the course of performing this analysis.\nAfter evaluating all the relevant positive and negative evidence, the Company is not recording any additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the United States. The Company is in a net deferred tax liability position and has sufficient future taxable income from the reversal of taxable temporary difference to offset the deductible temporary differences. The Company continued to hold a United States valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain state tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards. The Company also maintains valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign tax-paying components as of the end of fiscal year 2023.\nIt is reasonably possible in future years that the Company may not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred assets and recording a valuation allowance may be necessary. The Company has recognized pre-tax losses in the United States from continuing operations in recent years. If the Company continues to recognize losses in the United States and uses those losses to offset the future taxable temporary differences, it may become necessary to record a valuation allowance against future losses.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company has tax-effected federal, state and foreign net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $0.4 million, $2.1 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates through 2030. The state of net operating loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2026. The majority of the foreign net operating loss carryovers have an indefinite carry-forward in Germany.\nThe Company has performed studies to determine if there are any annual limitations on the federal net operating losses under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of these studies, the Company has determined that ownership changes have occurred primarily in connection with acquisitions when the Company has issued stock to the sellers, as well as ownership changes in the subsidiaries acquired by the Company. The benefits of the net operating losses that will expire before utilization have not been recorded as deferred tax assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Limitations on the current year use of net operating loss carryovers have also been recorded in the tax expense.\nThe Company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities involve judgment and estimation, and they are monitored based on the best information available. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the consolidated liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n1,679\n$\n2,006\n$\n16,722\nReductions from lapses in statutes of limitation\n(1,381)\n(327)\n(14,716)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n$\n1,679\n$\n2,006\nAll of the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company recognizes interest related to unrecognized benefits as a component of the income tax (benefit) expense, of which $0.1 million, $0.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, was recognized for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes in various jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to the Companys interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it files.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to income tax audits in various global jurisdictions in which it operates. The years subject to examination vary for the United States and international jurisdictions, with the earliest tax year being 2018. Based on the outcome of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits could change from those recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently does not anticipate it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest on those benefits will be reduced in the next 12 months.\n18. Net Income (Loss) per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share and basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding are as follows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended September 30,\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(12,883)\n$\n(11,286)\n$\n(28,869)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(1,374)\n2,144,145\n139,616\nNet income (loss)\n(14,257)\n2,132,859\n110,747\nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in computing basic income (loss) per share\n66,253\n74,897\n74,229\nDilutive restricted stock units\n-\n-\nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted income (loss) per share\n66,253\n74,897\n74,455\nBasic net income (loss) per share:\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(0.19)\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n(0.39)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(0.02)\n28.63\n1.88\nBasic net income (loss) per share\n$\n(0.22)\n$\n28.48\n$\n1.49\nDiluted net income (loss) per share:\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(0.19)\n$\n(0.15)\n$\n(0.39)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(0.02)\n28.63\n1.88\nDiluted net income (loss) per share\n$\n(0.22)\n$\n28.48\n$\n1.49\nRestricted stock units of 332,029, 64,122 and 24,012, respectively, during fiscal year 2023, 2022 and 2021 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\n19. Segment and Geographic Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance. The Companys Chief Executive Officer is the Companys chief operating decision maker.\nThe Company operates in two reportable segments: the Life Sciences Products segment, and the Life Sciences Services segment. These reportable segments also represent the Companys operating segments. The Company previously operated in three reportable segments, the Semiconductor Solutions Group segment, the Life Sciences Products segment, and the Life Sciences Services segment. As discussed in Note 3, Discontinued Operations, the sale of the semiconductor automation business, which comprised the Semiconductor Solutions Group segment, was completed on February 1, 2022. Historical information has been adjusted to reflect the new reportable segments.\nThe Companys Life Sciences Products segment provides automated cold storage solutions for biological and chemical compound samples. The Companys storage systems provide reliable automation and sample inventory management at temperatures down to -190\u00b0C and can store anywhere from one to millions of samples. The Companys sample management solutions include consumable vials and tubes, polymerase chain reaction, plates, instruments for supporting workflows, and informatics. This portfolio provides customers with a high level of sample quality, security,\navailability, intelligence, and integrity throughout the lifecycle of samples providing customers with complete end-to-end cold chain of custody capabilities. The Company also provides controlled rate thawing devices and transportation solutions that enable the delivery of life-saving treatments for customers in the medical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries adding differentiated solutions for reliable and traceable transport of temperature-sensitive samples. The Company also provides vaccine cold storage and transport, as well as 2D barcode readers for life sciences applications.\nThe Companys Life Sciences Services business is a leading provider of solutions addressing the many needs of customers in genomic analysis and the management and care of biological samples used in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, healthcare, clinical, and academic research and development markets. The Company processes millions of samples annually, each containing valuable information that must be delivered or preserved with the sample. The Companys genomic services provide a broad capability to customers for gene sequencing, synthesis, editing and related services. The Companys sample management services include off-site storage, transport services, laboratory services, sample procurement, and interactive informatics solutions. The Company also offers expert-level consultation services to clients throughout their experimental design and implementation process. The storage services include short- and long-term sample storage and management of the cold chain of custody from collection, to storage, to retrieving the sample which ultimately may go back into the research workflow.\nManagement considers operating income, which excludes charges related to amortization of intangible assets other than completed technology, restructuring and related charges, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, merger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase, and other unallocated corporate expenses, as the primary performance metric when evaluating the Companys operations.\nThe following is the summary of the financial information for the Companys reportable segments for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenue:\nLife Sciences Products\n$\n305,184\n$\n199,230\n$\n199,606\nLife Sciences Services\n359,888\n356,268\n314,097\nTotal revenue\n$\n665,072\n$\n555,498\n$\n513,703\nOperating income (loss):\nLife Sciences Products\n$\n(30,321)\n$\n11,033\n$\n23,094\nLife Sciences Services\n(14,722)\n10,784\n22,659\nSegment operating income (loss)\n(45,043)\n21,817\n45,753\nAmortization of intangible assets other than completed technology\n28,207\n24,965\n29,299\nRestructuring and restructuring related charges\n4,577\n13,749\nContingent consideration - fair value adjustments\n(18,549)\n-\nMerger and acquisition costs and costs related to share repurchase(1)\n13,842\n17,329\n20,662\nOther unallocated corporate expenses\n2,946\n13,132\nTotal operating loss\n(73,126)\n(24,735)\n(31,089)\nInterest income\n43,735\n20,286\nInterest expense\n-\n(4,589)\n(2,037)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n(632)\n-\nOther, net\n(1,042)\n(266)\n(16,475)\nLoss before income taxes\n$\n(30,433)\n$\n(9,936)\n$\n(48,969)\n(1) Includes expenses related to governance-related matters.\nAssets:\nSeptember 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLife Sciences Products\n$\n927,033\n$\n378,790\nLife Sciences Services\n794,752\n849,603\nTotal assets\n$\n1,721,785\n$\n1,228,393\nPrior year amounts in the Operating income (loss) table above have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Companys reportable segments assets to the amounts presented in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nSegment assets\n$\n1,721,785\n$\n1,228,393\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities\n1,134,256\n2,305,081\nDeferred tax assets\n1,169\nOther assets\n29,108\n181,479\nTotal assets\n$\n2,885,720\n$\n3,716,122\nRevenue from external customers is attributed to geographic areas based on locations in which customer orders are placed.

This customer is related to the Life Science Products segment and is a distributor shipping to end users in approximately 50 countries. The Company had no individual customer that accounted for more than 10% of its consolidated revenue for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. There was no customer that accounted for more than 10% of the Companys accounts receivable balance for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n20. Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or, in certain instances, provide reasonable ranges of potential losses.\nThe Company may also have certain indemnification obligations pursuant to claims made under the definitive agreement it entered into with Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) in connection with the\nCompanys sale of its semiconductor cryogenics business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, Edwards asserted claims for indemnification under the definitive agreement relating to alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to customer warranty claims and inventory (the 2020 Claim). In addition, in January 2023, Edwards filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in the County of New York seeking indemnification from the Company under such definitive agreement for $1.0 million and other related damages, including interest and attorneys fees, arising from a third-party claim that was included as part of their initial claims (the 2023 Claim).\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability of $2.5 million for the litigation with Edwards related to the 2020 and 2023 Claim of which $0.8 million was paid during the third quarter of 2023.\nIn April 2023, the Company responded to and filed a counterclaim against Edwards for the 2023 Claim alleging breach of the definitive agreements by Edwards and seeking a declaratory judgment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company and Edwards entered into a settlement agreement related to the 2023 Claim to avoid the costs and uncertainties of potential litigation. Under the settlement agreement, the Company paid Edwards $0.8 million from one of the indemnification escrows established at closing of the sale in return for the release of the 2023 Claim and any residual funds in this escrow. The 2020 Claim remains outstanding and $1.7 million remains in the balance of the accrued liability.\nThe Company cannot determine the probability of any losses or outcome of the 2020 Claim including the amount of any indemnifiable losses, if any, resulting from these claims. However, the Company does not believe that this claim will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. If the resolution of the 2020 Claim results in indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable indemnification deductibles established under the definitive agreement, Edwards would be required to seek recovery under the representation and warranty insurance Edwards obtained in connection with the closing of the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business. Management believes that any indemnifiable losses in excess of the applicable deductibles established in the definitive agreement would be covered by such insurance. For indemnifiable claims other than those arising from breaches of representations and warranties and for indemnifiable claims arising from breaches of representations and warranties exceeding the maximum coverage of the representations and warranties insurance policy, Edwards could seek recovery of such indemnifiable losses, if any, directly from the Company. In the event of unexpected subsequent developments and given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, there can be no assurance that the Companys assessment of any claim will reflect the ultimate outcome, and an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nTariff Matter\nWith the assistance of a third-party consultant, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 the Company initiated a review of the transaction value it used to calculate tariffs on inter-company imports of samples shipped from its GENEWIZ business. As a result, this review and a new interpretation surrounding the valuation method used to calculate the estimated transaction value, the Company revised its estimate of the tariffs owed and recorded a liability of $6.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company submitted a payment in the amount of $5.9 million to the customs authorities during fiscal 2022, related to November 2021 and prior periods. The customs authorities are in process of reviewing the Companys calculation of tariffs for these periods to determine if any further tariffs are owed. The company is currently in process of revising its tariff calculation methodology to align with the interpretation provided by customs authorities. The estimated amount owed to customs authorities under this revised methodology has been accrued in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPurchase Commitments\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had non-cancellable commitments of $73.5 million, comprised of purchase orders for inventory of $51.3 million, and information technology related commitments of $22.2 million.\n21. Subsequent Events\nSegment Change\nEffective October 1, 2023, the Company realigned its organizational structure from two principal business segments to three principal business segments to enhance its commercial strategy for accelerating growth and to enable additional profitability initiatives. The three new principal business segments are aligned with industry end-users and purchase decision-makers: Multiomics and Synthesis Solutions, Sample Management Solutions, and B Medical Systems.\n\u25cf Multiomics and Synthesis Solutions. The Multiomics and Synthesis Solutions business resources will operate under a single structure that aligns scientists, marketing resources, and decision-making around the customer, with a full embodiment of the GENEWIZ heritage of solid science, superior service.\n\u25cf Sample Management Solutions (SMS). Sample & Repository Solutions (SRS), Ultracold Systems and Consumables and Instruments resources will operate as a single business unit offering end-to-end sample management services and products.\n\u25cf B Medical Systems (BMS). BMS will continue under its current management structure, focused on the manufacturing and distribution of temperature-controlled storage and transportation solutions in international markets to governments, health institutions, and non-government organizations.\nAs a result of the segment change, the Company utilized a relative fair value approach to allocate goodwill to the reporting units existing under the new organizational structure as of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The book value of the B Medical reporting unit approximates fair value and is expected to include approximately $107 million of goodwill as of October 1, 2023. In the event the financial performance of any of the reporting units does not meet managements expectations in the future, the Company experiences a prolonged macroeconomic or market downturn, or there are other negative revisions to key assumptions used in the DCF Method, the Company may be required to perform additional impairment analyses with respect to such reporting unit and could be required to recognize an impairment charge.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares of common stock for $103.9 million (excluding fees, commissions, and excise tax) under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization subsequent to September 30, 2023 through the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn November 13, 2023, the Company announced its intention in fiscal 2024 to repurchase the remaining $500 million in shares of common stock available under the 2022 Repurchase Authorization.\nPlease refer to Note 13, Stockholders Equity for further detail regarding the 2022 Repurchase Authorization. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Financial Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of our chief executive and chief financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Sates, or GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our assets;\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nIn October 2022, we completed our acquisition of B Medical Systems S.\u00e1 r.l. and its subsidiaries (B Medical). We have excluded B Medical from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. B Medical is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total revenue and assets represented approximately 17% of our consolidated revenue and 5% of our consolidated assets for the year ended and as of September 30, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, no director nor officer of the Company adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except that on July 17, 2023, Lindon Robertson, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, terminated a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement that had been entered into on December 8, 2022, for the sale of up to 43,213 shares during the time period from December 8, 2022 through December 8, 2023, of which 0 shares were sold under this trading arrangement before its termination.\nAppointment of Principal Financial Officer\nIn connection with the previously announced retirement of Lindon Robertson, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, on November 20, 2023, the Company appointed Herman Cueto, the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to act as the Companys Principal Financial Officer.\nItem 9C.
