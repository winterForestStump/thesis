Acquisitions and other investments, and Note 6. Equity method investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.\nSale of AmerisourceBergen common stock\nOn May 11, 2022, the Company sold 6.0 million shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) common stock pursuant to Rule 144 at a price of $150 per share for a total consideration of $900 million.

Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.\nCareCentrix acquisition\nOn August 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a majority interest in CareCentrix. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired approximately 55% controlling equity interest in CareCentrix, a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors, for cash consideration of $332 million.\nThe Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in consolidation of CareCentrix within the U.S. Healthcare segment in its financial statements.\nSee Note 3.

These agreements have been amended multiple times, most recently in June 2021, in connection with the Company's sale of its Alliance Healthcare business to AmerisourceBergen (the Alliance Healthcare Sale). Pursuant to those amendments, the U.S. distribution agreement was extended through 2029 and the parties committed to pursue additional opportunities in sourcing and distribution. The parties also agreed that Alliance Healthcare UK will remain the distribution partner of Boots until 2031.\nThe Company also holds a substantial investment in AmerisourceBergen. The Company accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the Companys investment being classified within the operating income of its U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings (loss) from AmerisourceBergen are reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nSee Managements discussion and analysis in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2. Discontinued operations, Note 6. Equity method investments and Note 19. Related parties, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, for further information.\nIndustry overview\nThe retail pharmacy industry across the globe is highly competitive and dynamic and has experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. The Company believes the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in the availability of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the U.S., baby boomers increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients.\nThe retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third-party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third-party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the U.S., can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the U.S. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the U.S. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government, which shall take effect in 2023. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation for drugs used by Medicare beneficiaries. The mechanics of the rebate calculation would mimic those of the Medicaid rebate, but the expansion of inflation-based rebates may further complicate pricing strategies, particularly as to the launch of our new products. When third-party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.\nThese industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years. Since the completion of the strategic combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in December 2014, the Company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 3\nGeneric prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payers. The Company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the U.S., generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. In general, in the U.S., the specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription, but lower gross margin, as compared to generic prescription drugs.\nThe Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the Company competes to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and the Company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited access to primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings.\nSegments\nThe Company's operations are conducted through three reportable segments:\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy,\nInternational, and\nU.S. Healthcare.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the Companys business activities, structure and strategy. The United States segment was renamed to U.S. Retail Pharmacy and the Walgreens Health segment was renamed to U.S. Healthcare. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. The information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names.\nIn fiscal 2022, our segment sales were: U.S. Retail Pharmacy $109.1 billion, International $21.8 billion and U.S. Healthcare $1.8 billion. Additional information relating to our segments is included in Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, and in Note 17. Segment reporting and Note 18. Sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\nThe Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment includes the Walgreens business which is comprised of the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, specialty and home delivery pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.\nSales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise. The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Company operated 8,886 retail stores in the segment as of August 31, 2022. The principal retail pharmacy brands in the segment are Walgreens and Duane Reade. The Company is a market leader in the U.S. and, as of August 31, 2022, approximately 78% of the population of the U.S. lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.\nThe Company is focused on creating a neighborhood health destination and a more modern pharmacy aligned to a wider range of healthcare services. Significant investments have accelerated the Company's customer-centric approach, with specific focus on transforming omni-channel capabilities and offerings across retail and healthcare. The Companys services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers, including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. The Company utilizes its retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to its customers and patients, as illustrated by the Companys ability to play a significant role in providing vaccinations. Additionally, through our key collaborations, we aim to develop new healthcare delivery models and to improve the speed, efficiency and safety of the prescription fulfillment process. We have taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, to provide an integrated primary care and pharmacy model that aims to drive better health outcomes, reduce costs and provide a differentiated patient experience to the communities we serve.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 4\nThe Company also provides specialty pharmacy and mail services and offers certain other health and wellness services throughout the U.S. The Company employs more than 85,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.\nThe segment provides customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise, such as NICE!, Finest Nutrition, No7, and Soap & Glory, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across the U.S. Integrated with the Companys e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive notifications when a refill is due and choose their delivery option, which includes in-store pick up, drive-through or delivery to their home.\nIn fiscal 2021, we launched myWalgreens, replacing the former Balanced Rewards customer loyalty program, to provide a new interface for customers to access the enhanced and growing Walgreens digital offering. The new program simplifies how customers accumulate and use rewards. Points have been replaced by Walgreens Cash, reflecting the actual value of the reward and allowing the cash benefit to be applied as the customer chooses, not just to future transactions at Walgreens but even in support of their favorite charity or community cause. The number of myWalgreens members continues to grow and as of August 31, 2022, totaled approximately 102 million.\nThe Walgreens Find Care platform also includes telehealth service providers, connecting patients and customers with options to access convenient and affordable care from their mobile devices. Additionally, the Company has expanded the retail functionality of its mobile application, such as extending drive-through service to include retail products, curbside collection for online orders and same day offerings including pick up orders within 30 minutes. The segment is also implementing new approaches to promotions, product selection and other areas to deliver greater value to its customers in its stores, including an enhanced beauty offering.\nThe components of the segments sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, health and wellness, beauty and personal care, and consumables and general merchandise). The segments sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the cough, cold and flu seasons and winter holiday. This seasonality also can affect the segments proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the segments fiscal year sales were as follows:\nFiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020\nPharmacy 74 % 76 % 75 %\nRetail 26 % 24 % 25 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\nThe Company filled 819.6 million prescriptions (including vaccinations) in the segment in fiscal 2022. Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 1.2 billion in fiscal 2022. The Company fills prescriptions under Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit and prescription drug plans and programs, including the federal 340B drug pricing program. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 97% of the segments fiscal 2022 Pharmacy sales.\nThe Company fills prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 5% of the segments fiscal 2022 sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 22% of the segments fiscal 2022 sales.\nThe Company's myWalgreens Credit Card program features the myWalgreens Mastercard and the myWalgreens Credit Card. These cards are the first ever of their kind to reward more personalized wellbeing choices and offer industry-leading rewards at Walgreens locations, Walgreens.com, Duane Reade stores, via the Walgreens mobile app, and wherever Mastercard is accepted.\nAmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the segments pharmacies. The Company purchases its non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.\nThe segments sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of the Companys control can affect timing for a generic conversion, the Company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 5\nThe current environment of the Companys pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure, a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions), an increased volume of Medicare Part D prescriptions and increased consumer use of prescription discount cards. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.\nThe Company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, government, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payers. Agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and the Companys reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2022 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.\nThe Company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time.\nThe Companys 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides the Company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. Similarly, the specialty prescription business, which generates higher sales dollars per prescription, may result in gross margin pressures within the industry, as compared to generic prescription drugs. The segments performance is also impacted by the current environment, including the uncertainty as a result of COVID-19. For more information, see Risk factors in Item 1A. Risk factors\nIn addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on funding from our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly based on seasonality and other factors.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.\nRisks from Changes in Public Policy and Other Legal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.\nWe are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\nA significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.\nWe could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 14\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Organization\nCertain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nConflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nGlobal health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nCOVID-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to severely impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. As a result, governmental authorities imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety, all of which had an adverse impact on footfall in our stores, general economic activity and consumer behavior and spending patterns. COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 and related measures have impacted and may continue to impact many aspects of our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to our growth, product costs, supply chain disruptions and the potential for inventory spoilage, labor shortages and costs, operating costs, logistics constraints, customer demand for our products and industry demand generally, consumer spending, our liquidity, the price of our securities, our ability to access capital markets, and the global economy and financial markets generally. Our stores are open and operational, however, any future illness or absence of a substantial number of employees could require that we temporarily close one or more of our stores. We have experienced and may experience in the future, disruptions in store and distribution centers operations, including the temporary closure of certain stores.\nWe have incurred and continue to incur additional costs to protect the health and well-being and meet the needs of our customers and team members. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our customers and employees. Illness, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our business operations. Further, the shift to a remote working environment and other policies has, and will continue to have, impacts on our business, including increased costs related to information technology infrastructure and the ability of our business and that of our suppliers to work with the same productivity. The increase in remote work arrangements has increased certain operational risks, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of public safety measures, and the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 15\nReductions in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third-party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, governmental agencies, and other third-party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the U.S., plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliations payments can vary significantly and may not follow a predictable path. Further, in an environment where some PBM clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.\nIn addition, many payers in the U.S. are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost, which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third-party payers, could adversely affect us.\nA shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans, products and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, our U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years and more recently during COVID-19, and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S. and a larger proportion of our revenues. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin. Our U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in recent years, and that trend may continue. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted market competitive reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Changes in pricing and other terms of our contracts with PBM companies can significantly impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM companys pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 16\nWe could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.\nThe profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations.\nConsolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams.\nOur business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.\nOur Board of Directors approved the plans to increase the Transformational Cost Management Program described in \"Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" in Part II, Item 7 as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these programs. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Transformational Cost Management Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to implement the programs or deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nChanges in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.\nOur performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), as well as looting, vandalism, acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. In addition to general levels of inflation that we have experienced, we are also subject to risk of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to, for example, the continuing impacts of COVID-19, related global supply chain disruptions, and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. If inflation continues to increase, we may not be able to adjust prices sufficiently to offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin. Furthermore, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 17\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving and changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.\nThe level of competition in the retail pharmacy, healthcare services and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. All of our businesses face intense competition from multiple existing and new businesses, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. We continue to develop our offerings to respond to market dynamics; however, if our customers are not receptive to these changes, if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner, or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nSpecialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. Accordingly, it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market, or our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To better serve this evolving market, the Company wholly owns and operates AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients of AllianceRx Walgreens were and are not obligated to contract through AllianceRx Walgreens, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through AllianceRx Walgreens which impacts gross sales. If AllianceRx Walgreens is not able to compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during COVID-19. The pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.\nIf the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge the demand for products and services we sell or our customers purchasing habits, we may be faced with sales declines, excess product inventories and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 18\nOur substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.\nOur substantial international business operations are subject to a number of risks, including, without limitation, compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands; tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the U.S.; and the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets.\nThese factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals.\nWe recognize the rising importance of environmental, social, and governance matters among our team members, customers, and certain shareholders and are committed to upholding a culture dedicated to corporate responsibility. We have established certain goals that allow us to better communicate and align to our environmental, social, and governance strategy. However, these goals are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are outside of our control and might prohibit us from meeting the goals. Further, there is a risk that team members, customers, or certain shareholders might not be satisfied with our goals or strategy and efforts to meet the goals. Some of the risks that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategy within the timeframe or costs projected; the availability or cost of renewable energy, materials, goods, and/or services required, and evolving regulations or requirements that change or limit our ability to set standards or gather information from our supplier partners or third party contractors. Failure to meet our goals could negatively impact public perception of our company with interested stakeholders.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance matters are also increasingly important to current and potential employees. In order to retain and attract talent we know that it is critical that we clearly communicate our environmental, social, and governance strategy, and a delay or inability to meet our goals on time could impact our reputation as a desirable place to work. With increased interest from certain shareholders, an inability to meet our goals could also have a negative impact on our stock price. These impacts could make it more difficult for us to operate efficiently and effectively and could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial conditions.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nDisruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as COVID-19 or other health epidemics or pandemics, labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a suppliers financial distress, natural disasters, looting, vandalism or acts of war (such as the conflict in Ukraine) or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nWe outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. We rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. If our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 19\nWe use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products.\nThe Company and AmerisourceBergen are parties to various agreements and arrangements, including a pharmaceutical distribution agreement between the Company and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. These agreements were amended in June 2021 in connection with the Alliance Healthcare Sale. Pursuant to those amendments, the U.S. distribution agreement was extended through 2029 and the parties committed to pursue additional opportunities in sourcing and distribution. The parties also agreed that Alliance Healthcare UK will remain the distribution partner of Boots until 2031. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes substantially all of our branded and generic pharmaceutical products. Consequently, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences, including those resulting from COVID-19. For example, if AmerisourceBergens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, pandemic, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to retain and recruit, or failure to manage succession of, key personnel could have an adverse impact on our future performance.\nOur ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced employees at all levels, including in executive and other key strategic positions, is essential for us to meet our objectives. Competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees which could have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any failure to adequately plan for and manage succession of key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.\nWe may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The terms of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of, or requested modifications to, those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. If we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 20\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.\nThe long-term effects of global climate change present both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. In addition, many of our operations and facilities around the world are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores, distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. We also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years, which may increase our costs associated with compliance and merchandise. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Strategy\nWe may not be successful in executing elements of our business strategy, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe engage in strategic initiatives to, among other reasons, maximize long-term shareholder value, expand on our consumer-centric approach, strengthen our partnerships with local healthcare providers and improve health outcomes. These strategic initiatives may not result in improvements in future financial performance. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these strategic initiatives, or that these initiatives will not result in additional unanticipated costs. The failure to realize the benefits of any strategic initiatives or successfully structure our business to meet market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances.\nA significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence, acquire and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our growth strategies, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to integrate and retain qualified and experienced employees from acquired businesses at all levels, including in executive and other key strategic positions, is essential for us to meet our growth strategy and successfully complete acquisition, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances.\nThese transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 21\nBusinesses acquired as part of our U.S. Healthcare segment could experience losses or liabilities that would result in a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.\nHealthcare businesses acquired as part of our U.S. Healthcare segment could experience losses or liabilities, including medical liability claims, causing us to incur significant expenses and requiring us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance. These businesses have in the past been subject to medical liability claims in the ordinary course of business, and although we carry insurance covering medical malpractice claims, including professional liability insurance, in amounts we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business, successful medical liability claims could resulting in substantial damage awards that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. Professional liability insurance is expensive and insurance premiums may increase significantly in the future, particularly as we expand our services. As a result, adequate professional liability insurance may not be available to our providers or to us in the future at acceptable costs or at all. Any claims made against us or our acquired businesses that are not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against, result in substantial damage awards against us and divert the attention of our management and our providers from our operations, which could harm our business. In addition, any claims may significantly harm our business or reputation.\nIn addition, the businesses acquired as part of our U.S. Healthcare segment expose us to risks that are inherent in the provision of healthcare services. If patients, clients or partners assert liability claims against us, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert managements attention from operations, and decrease market acceptance of our services and care delivery model. We do not control the providers and other healthcare professionals in our U.S. Healthcare segment with respect to the practice of medicine and the provision of healthcare services, and the risk of liability, including through unexpected medical outcomes, is inherent to the healthcare industry.\nThe businesses acquired as part of the U.S. Healthcare segment have also entered and intend to continue to enter risk-based contracts with payors, pursuant to which they contract with payors to receive a fee for professional services based on the number of patients assigned or attributed to U.S. Healthcare providers and assume the financial responsibility for the healthcare expenses of such patients, These contracts may also include arrangements that contemplate sharing certain of the savings generated with respect to U.S. Healthcare segments patients costs of care back with the payor. To the extent that patients require more care than is anticipated or the cost of care increases, aggregate compensation amounts may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with treatment. If medical costs and expenses exceed estimates, except in very limited circumstances, our healthcare businesses will not be able to increase the fee received under these risk agreements during their then-current terms and could suffer losses with respect to such agreements, which may adversely impact the growth, profitability and liquidity of our U.S. Healthcare segment.\nThe anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized.\nAs of August 31, 2022, we beneficially owned approximately 25.4% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one nominee for election to AmerisourceBergens board of directors. The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Companys U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation matters, will impact the Companys results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely impact our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 22\nFrom time to time, we may choose to divest certain assets or businesses as we execute our strategy and our ability to engage in such transactions will be subject to market conditions beyond our control which will affect our ability to transact on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe have, from time to time, divested certain assets or businesses in order to redeploy capital into our core strategies. The success of such transactions in the future will be subject to market conditions, availability of financing and other circumstances beyond our control. For instance, on June 28, 2022, we announced our decision to maintain the Boots and No7 Beauty Company businesses under existing ownership. This marked the conclusion of the review that began in January 2022 in line with our strategic priorities. In the future, we may intend to relaunch a process for the sale of the businesses or contemplate other opportunities to monetize our interest in these businesses. In addition, we have recently divested of a portion of our interests in AmerisourceBergen (See Part II, Item 7, Investment in AmerisourceBergen for further information) and Option Care Health, Inc. and may choose to divest more of our interests in the future. However, our ability to divest these or any of our other assets, will be subject to global financial markets and market instability which may severely impact the ability to divest, divestiture terms, financing availability and other considerations for potential buyers.\nFrom time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control and some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.\nFrom time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. Some of the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons.\nCybersecurity, Data Privacy and Information Security Risks\nA significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems or those of businesses we rely on could harm us.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber-attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, changes in security processes, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. We rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services. Information technology projects or services frequently are long-term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including strategic and business partners, key payers and vendors.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 23\nPrivacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden and any failure to comply could harm us.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. In the U.S., for example, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the healthcare industry, including healthcare providers such as pharmacies. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of personal information of California residents, and other jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data. Outside the U.S., for example, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders.\nCompliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. We also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply. A significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy and information security laws could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations, financial position and results of operations.\nWe and businesses we interact with experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches.\nThe protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach or theft of customer, employee, or company data, could create significant workflow disruption, attract media attention, damage our customer relationships, reputation and brand, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs and banking and credit programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payers, strategic partners and cloud service providers. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including from vandalism or theft of physical systems or media and from perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions.\nCompromises of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact that result in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, have in the past and could in the future adversely impact us. Any such compromise could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. The risks associated with data security and cybersecurity incidents have increased during COVID-19 given the increased reliance on remote work arrangements.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 24\nWe are subject to payment-related and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay\u2122, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which has made and could continue to make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we offer branded credit cards, money (wire) transfer services and sell prepaid debit, credit and gift cards at certain business units. These products and services require us to comply with global anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and damage to our reputation.\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\nWe have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.\nWe have outstanding debt and other financial obligations. As of August 31, 2022, we had approximately $11.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\nrequiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes;\nmaking it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing;\nreducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and\nexposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations and undrawn revolving credit facilities is at variable interest rates.\nWe may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. Incurrence of additional debt by us and changes in our operating performance could also adversely affect our credit ratings. Any actual or anticipated downgrade of our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, financial covenants, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.\nOur long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 25\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on funding from our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.\nThe Company is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and international subsidiaries, to pay dividends and meet its obligations. The Companys subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to the Company, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of the Company's common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of the Company, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to the Company by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries earnings and business considerations. Future dividends to the Company will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its Board of Directors.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly based on seasonality and other factors.\nOur operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis, including increased variability during COVID-19, and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. For instance, our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February), which falls during the holiday season, typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year. Other factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the impact and duration of COVID-19, the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; seasonality, including the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms; the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliation payments, fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges, including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; market conditions, widespread looting or vandalism; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nAs of August 31, 2022, we had $22.3 billion of goodwill and $10.7 billion of other intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. We determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt and equity, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization, whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise. There can be no assurance that impairments will not occur, and any impairment may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 26\nWe are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe operate or have equity method investments in several countries across the globe which expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than a businesses functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British pound sterling, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.\nWe operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the UK, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plans assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation and other macroeconomic factors, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nRisks from Changes in Public Policy and Other Legal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the U.S. and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government, which shall take effect in 2023. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation for drugs used by Medicare beneficiaries. The mechanics of the rebate calculation would mimic those of the Medicaid rebate, but the expansion of inflation-based rebates may further complicate pricing strategies, particularly as to the launch of our new products. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, thereby reducing our profitability.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 27\nWe expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing, and these pressures could be further exacerbated if payer deficits or shortfalls increase due to COVID-19 or otherwise. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies and practices as well as applicable government regulations, including, for example, in connection with the federal 340B drug pricing program, could also significantly reduce our profitability.\nWe are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, including those contained in Note 11. Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. For example, in January 2019, Walgreen Co., on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates, resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into, among other things, a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a five-year term and provides that Walgreen Co. shall, among other things, continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal healthcare program requirements, provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees. Failure to meet the Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us, including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of non-compliance. In addition, in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs, or subjected to other significant penalties, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial results.\nLegal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioid matters, including federal multidistrict litigation that consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and others, as well as numerous lawsuits brought in state courts. Additionally, the Company has received from the Department of Justice and the Attorney Generals of numerous states subpoenas, civil investigative demands and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. The Company incurs and expects to continue to incur significant expense in order to resolve those and other opioids-related matters, including through settlement agreements. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. See Note 11. Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.\nThe Companys financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment. For example, AmerisourceBergen is involved in litigation and legal proceeding, including those relating to opioid matters. Any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results.\nLike other companies in the retail pharmacy, healthcare services and pharmaceutical wholesale industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. There continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding business, compliance and reporting practices of the Company and other industry participants. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. In addition, under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of false claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 28\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources.\nA significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.\nWe operate in complex, highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing, billing practices, utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, each of which continues to evolve, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing healthcare fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the U.S., the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government, which shall take effect in 2023. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another partys intellectual property rights.\nChanges in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S. and the National Health Service in the UK; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and brand, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 29\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.\nWe are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and economic and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the UK Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. Violations of these laws and regulations or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws may subject us to penalties, sanctions, including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, including through services provided by third-party healthcare providers, we are also exposed to risks relating to the products and services we offer. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us and mandatory or voluntary product recalls may apply to us with respect to any of the retail products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide, particularly with regard to our private branded products that are not available from other retailers. For example, from time to time, the FDA issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances, and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities or third-party healthcare providers that we do business with, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nAs a large corporation with operations in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions, from time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nTax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 30\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Organization\nCertain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of August 31, Stefano Pessina, our Executive Chairman (together with his affiliates, the SP Investors), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 17% of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in the Company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. In addition, issuances or sales of our common stock (or the exercise of related registration rights), including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors and certain other former Alliance Boots stockholders, are subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement (as defined herein). As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nConflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.\nConflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the shareholders agreement (the Company Shareholders Agreement) with certain SP Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Chairman, indirectly controls Alliance Sant\u00e9 Participations S.A. (ASP), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his spouse Ornella Barra, our Chief Operating Officer, International serve as directors of ASP. There are other arrangements between affiliates of Mr. Pessina and the Company, with required disclosures included in the Companys annual proxy statement, including with respect to Alliance Healthcare Italia SpA, which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Pessina (and in which, until April 2022, the Company held an indirect 9% interest), which operates Boots branded stores in Italy. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transactions approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.\nUnder the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).\nWhile these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 31\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. Activity under this program was suspended in July 2020 and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume. If resumed, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Item 1B. Unresolved staff comments\nThere are no unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC Staff 180 days or more before the end of the fiscal year relating to the Companys periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. Item 2. Properties\nThe following information regarding the Companys properties is provided as of August 31, 2022 and does not include properties of unconsolidated, partially-owned entities.\nRetail stores and clinics\nThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment operated 8,886 retail stores and 3 specialty pharmacies. The International segment operated 3,989 retail stores and 341 standalone Boots Opticians locations. The U.S. Healthcare segment included 334 VillageMD clinics of which 146 were co-located clinics, 124 were standalone clinics and 64 were affiliate clinics.\nThe following is a breakdown of the Companys domestic and international retail stores and clinics by segment:\nRetail stores and clinics\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy:\nUnited States 1\n8,784\nPuerto Rico 104\nU.S. Virgin Islands 1\n8,889\nInternational:\nUnited Kingdom 2,573\nMexico 1,133\nChile 295\nThailand 237\nThe Republic of Ireland 92\n4,330\nU.S. Healthcare - standalone clinics 124\nWalgreens Boots Alliance total 13,343\n1 Includes VillageMD co-located clinics\nThe Companys domestic and international retail stores and clinics, which includes Boots Opticians and specialty pharmacy locations, covered approximately 143 million square feet. The Company owned approximately 8% and 4% of these U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segment locations, respectively.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in Risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.\nCertain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented.\nINTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Walgreens Boots Alliance or the Company) is a global leader in retail pharmacy and is positioning itself to become a leading provider of healthcare services. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy,\nInternational, and\nU.S. Healthcare.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the Companys business activities, structure and strategy. The United States segment was renamed to U.S. Retail Pharmacy and the Walgreens Health segment was renamed to U.S. Healthcare. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. The information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names. See Note 17. Segment reporting and Note 18. Sales, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.\nFACTORS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY\nThe Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of COVID-19 (COVID-19) on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the U.S. and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates.\nSpecialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. To better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in March 2017, the Company and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that sought to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. On December 31, 2021, the Company purchased Primes portion of the joint venture and now wholly own the joint venture, which was renamed AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients of AllianceRx Walgreens are not obligated to contract through AllianceRx Walgreens, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through AllianceRx Walgreens which impacts gross sales. However, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, the Company does not anticipate this will have a material impact on operating income.\nIn January 2022, the Company announced a strategic review of its Boots business, including the No7 beauty company. In June 2022, the Company announced the conclusion of the strategic review and decision to retain existing ownership in these businesses.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 35\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Companys pharmacies in the State of Florida. The settlement amount of $683 million includes $620 million to be paid in equal installments to the State of Florida over 18 years and will be applied as remediation of past and future opioid damages, as well as a one-time payment of $63 million for attorneys fees. The Company made the first annual settlement payment of $97.4 million into escrow on June 17, 2022.\nThese and other factors can affect the Companys operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nCOVID-19\nSince the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to directly and indirectly impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic and supply chain disruption in every region in which we operate, which has adversely affected our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets experienced volatility and could continue to experience volatility due to COVID-19 and other factors. As COVID-19 and its direct and indirect consequences continue to evolve, COVID-19 has impacted, and may again impact our business operations. In response to COVID-19 and emerging variants, various domestic and foreign, federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives were implemented that were designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S., and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and if available, may continue to do so in the future.\nThe Company continues to play a critical role in fighting COVID-19. The Company has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. government to help administer COVID-19 vaccinations to the general public and to high priority groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff. The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access, including same-day and walk-in appointments, mobile clinics, employer partnerships and extended hours. As of August 31, 2022, the Company has administered more than 69 million COVID-19 vaccinations, including 23 million booster vaccinations, and more than 45 million COVID-19 tests in the U.S. In fiscal 2022, the Company has administered approximately 35 million COVID-19 vaccinations and more than 31 million COVID-19 tests in the U.S.\nIn fiscal 2022, the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions filled increased 1.3%, including a positive impact of 12 basis points from COVID-19 vaccinations. Comparable retail sales increase was aided by at-home COVID-19 test sales.\nThe Company continues to monitor COVID-19 and its potential future impacts on the consumer, customer and healthcare utilization patterns, as well as the U.S. and global economies, including supply chains and the labor force. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact on the Company, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse.\nThe Companys current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and in Item 1A, Risk factors.\nU.S. Healthcare\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company announced the launch of its new healthcare strategy. The Company plans to become a leading provider of local clinical care services by leveraging its consumer-centric technology and retail pharmacy network to deliver value-based care. The Companys goal is to provide better consumer experiences, improve health outcomes and lower costs.\nThe Companys U.S. Healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 36\nThe U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in Village Practice Management Company, LLC (VillageMD), a leading, national provider of value-based primary care services; a majority position in Shields Health Solutions Parent, LLC (Shields), a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals, a majority position in CCX Next, LLC (CareCentrix), a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors; and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members caregivers through both digital and physical channels. On September 20, 2022, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 30% equity interest in Shields, not currently owned.\nThe Company is now aligned into three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare. Fiscal 2021 data related to the U.S. Healthcare segment, has been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform to the current period presentation.\nSee Note 17.

Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.\nTRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOn December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program). The Company achieved this goal at the end of fiscal 2021.\nOn October 12, 2021, the Company expanded and extended the Transformational Cost Management Program through the end of fiscal 2024 and increased its annual cost savings target to $3.3 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2022, the Company increased its annual cost savings target from $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. The Company is currently on track to achieve the savings target.\nThe Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Companys information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program which focus on the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International reportable segments along with the Company's global functions. Divisional optimization within the Companys segments includes activities such as optimization of stores, including plans to close approximately 350 stores in the UK and approximately 450 to 500 stores in the U.S. As of August 31, 2022, the Company has closed 235 and 287 stores in the UK and U.S., respectively.\nThe Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, of which $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. In addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program represent current or future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments.\nThe Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as follows:\nTransformational Cost Program Activities Range of Charges\nLease obligations and other real estate costs1\n1,250 to 1,350 million\nAsset impairments2\n750 to 800 million\nEmployee severance and business transition costs 1,025 to 1,075 million\nInformation technology transformation and other exit costs 300 to 350 million\nTotal cumulative pre-tax exit and disposal charges 3.3 to 3.6 billion\nOther IT transformation costs 275 to 325 million\nTotal estimated pre-tax charges 3.6 to 3.9 billion\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 38\n1Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n2Primarily related to store closures and other asset impairments.\nFrom the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to August 31, 2022, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $2.2 billion, of which $2.0 billion is recorded as exit and disposal activities.

The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.\nINVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN\nAs of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company owns approximately 25.4% and 28.5% of AmerisourceBergen outstanding common stock, based on the share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOn May 11, 2022, the Company sold 6.0 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock pursuant to Rule 144 at a price of $150 per share for a total consideration of $900 million, decreasing the Company's ownership of AmerisourceBergens common stock from 58,854,867 shares, held at August 31, 2021 to 52,854,867 shares held as of August 31, 2022. The transaction resulted in the Company recording a pre-tax gain of $417 million in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, including a $32 million loss reclassified from within Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company has a shareholders agreement with AmerisourceBergen, which was most recently amended and restated (the A&R Shareholders Agreement) in connection with the Company's sale of its Alliance Healthcare business to AmerisourceBergen (the Alliance Healthcare Sale). Pursuant to the A&R Shareholders Agreement, the Company has designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. The Company is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to acquire up to an additional 12,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market, and thereafter to designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.\nThe Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the investment classified within the Operating income of the Companys U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized equity earnings (losses) in AmerisourceBergen of $418 million, $(1.1) billion, and $341 million, respectively. The equity losses for fiscal 2021 were primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of a loss of $5.6 billion, net of tax, related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nThe Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale in June 2021 per the Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen. See Note 2. Discontinued operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.\nThe financial performance of AmerisourceBergen will impact the Companys results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Part I. Item 1. Business Relationship with AmerisourceBergen and Note 6. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 40\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following table presents certain key financial statistics for the Company for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n2022 2021 2020\nSales $ 132,703 $ 132,509 $ 121,982\nGross profit 28,265 28,067 26,078\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 27,295 24,586 25,436\nEquity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen 418 (1,139) 341\nOperating income 1,387 2,342 982\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) 1\n5,133 5,117 4,730\nEarnings before interest and income tax provision 4,385 2,900 1,060\nNet earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. - continuing operations (GAAP) 4,337 1,994 180\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. - continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure)1\n4,360 4,256 3,772\nDiluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (GAAP) 5.01 2.30 0.20\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure)1\n5.04 4.91 4.28\nPercentage increases (decreases)\n2022 2021 2020\nSales 0.1 8.6 1.6\nGross profit 0.7 7.6 (7.4)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 11.0 (3.3) 8.0\nOperating income (40.8) 138.4 (79.4)\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure)1\n0.3 8.2 (27.0)\nEarnings before interest and income tax provision 51.2 173.7 (78.8)\nNet earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. - continuing operations (GAAP) 117.5 NM (95.3)\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. - continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure)1\n2.5 12.8 (27.0)\nDiluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (GAAP) 117.6 NM (95.1)\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure)1\n2.5 14.6 (23.5)\nPercent to sales\n2022 2021 2020\nGross margin 21.3 21.2 21.4\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 20.6 18.6 20.9\n1See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nNM - Not meaningful.

For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2021.\nNet earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021\nFiscal 2022 net earnings attributable to the Company were $4.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share were $5.01 compared to $2.30 for the prior year period. The increases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflect a $2.5 billion after-tax gain during the three months ended November 30, 2021 due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held minority equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields to fair value, and a $1.2 billion charge, net of tax, from the Company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen in the prior fiscal year offset by the fiscal 2022 impairment charges related to intangible assets in Boots UK, and the charge related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in fiscal 2022.\nOther income, net in fiscal 2022 was $3.0 billion compared to $558 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in other income is mainly due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields to fair value, and the partial sale of the Companys equity method investments in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care Health.\nNet interest expense was $400 million and $905 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of early debt extinguishments completed during fiscal 2021 and lower interest rates on remaining debt.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a 0.8% benefit and 33.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to pre-tax gains from the consolidation of the Companys investments in VillageMD and Shields, for which a majority of these gains were not subject to tax. Additionally, the Company recognized tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care, capital gains recognized from internal restructuring, and based on forecasted capital gains. See Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments and Note 6. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to the Company in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $4.4 billion compared with the prior year period. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $5.04 compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.9 percentage points as a result of currency translation.\nExcluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2022 primarily reflects improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and a continued rebound in International segment sales and profitability, partly offset by a decrease in U.S. pharmacy operating results, and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations by segment for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\nThe Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment includes the Walgreens business which is comprised of the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, specialty and home delivery pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 42\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n(in millions, except location amounts)\n2022 2021 2020\nSales $ 109,078 $ 112,005 $ 107,701\nGross profit 23,669 23,736 22,302\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 21,180 20,042 19,331\nEquity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen 418 (1,139) 341\nOperating income 2,907 2,554 3,312\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) 1\n5,029 5,019 4,761\nNumber of prescriptions 2\n819.6 827.5 818.0\n30-day equivalent prescriptions 2,3\n1,216.4 1,210.6 1,165.3\nNumber of locations at period end 8,901 8,973 9,028\nPercentage increases (decreases)\n2022 2021 2020\nSales (2.6) 4.0 3.0\nGross profit (0.3) 6.4 (5.6)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 5.7 3.7 0.1\nOperating income 13.8 (22.9) (26.0)\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) 1\n0.2 5.4 (18.9)\nComparable sales 4\n5.1 5.1 2.8\nPharmacy sales (5.3) 5.5 4.3\nComparable pharmacy sales 4\n4.7 6.7 3.2\nRetail sales 5.6 (0.4) (0.4)\nComparable retail sales 4\n6.1 1.2 1.6\nComparable number of prescriptions 2,4\n(1.0) 2.4 (1.3)\nComparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions 2,3,4\n1.3 5.0 2.9\nPercent to sales\n2022 2021 2020\nGross margin 21.7 21.2 20.7\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 19.4 17.9 17.9\n1See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n2Includes vaccinations, including COVID-19.\n3Includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 43\n4Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods.\nNM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.\nSales fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021\nThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segments sales for fiscal 2022 decreased by 2.6 percent to $109.1 billion, including a 650 basis point impact of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline. Comparable sales increased by 5.1 percent in fiscal 2022.\nPharmacy sales decreased by 5.3 percent in fiscal 2022, including 8.6 percentage point of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline and represented 73.7 percent of the segments sales. Excluding AllianceRx Walgreens, pharmacy sales increased 4.2 percent in fiscal 2022. The increase is due to brand drug inflation and COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, partially offset by generic drug utilization and reimbursement pressure. In fiscal 2021, pharmacy sales increased 5.5 percent and represented 75.8 percent of the segments sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.7 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 6.7 percent in fiscal 2021. Within comparable sales, prescriptions filled in fiscal 2022 increased by 1.3 percent from a year earlier, including a positive impact of approximately 12 basis points from COVID-19 vaccinations. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 0.3 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to a reduction of 0.5 percent in fiscal 2021. The effect of generics on segment sales was a reduction of 0.2 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to a reduction of 0.4 percent for fiscal 2021. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2 percent of prescription sales for fiscal 2022 compared to 97.5 percent for fiscal 2021. The total number of prescriptions (including vaccinations) filled in fiscal 2022 was 819.6 million compared to 827.5 million in fiscal 2021. Prescriptions (including vaccinations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,216.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 1,210.6 million in fiscal 2021.\nRetail sales increased by 5.6 percent in fiscal 2022 and were 26.3 percent of the segments sales. In comparison, fiscal 2021 retail sales decreased by 0.4 percent and comprised 24.2 percent of the segments sales. Comparable retail sales increased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2022 and increased 1.2 percent in fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by health and wellness, including favorable impact of at-home COVID-19 tests and cough, cold and flu, as well as personal care and beauty, partially offset by the planned decline in tobacco.\nOperating income fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021\nThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segments operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 13.8 percent to $2.9 billion, including income of $418 million from the Company's share of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Excluding the impact of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen, the year over year decrease in operating income was driven by higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, including charges related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in the third quarter, offset by COVID-19 testing and retail gross profit growth.\nGross margin was 21.7 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to 21.2 percent in fiscal 2021. Gross margin was positively impacted in fiscal 2022 by retail margin, offset by pharmacy margin. The increase in retail margin was primarily due to favorable rate and product mix. The decrease in pharmacy margin was primarily driven by continued reimbursement pressure.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.4 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to 17.9 percent in fiscal 2021. The increase was driven by costs related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida, COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and labor investments, partially offset by savings related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 44\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy segments adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 0.2 percent to $5.0 billion. The increase was primarily due to retail gross profit growth and COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nSee --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nInternational\nThe Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.\nThe International segment operates in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso and therefore the segments results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk\nInterest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable-rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates, such as U.S. treasury rates and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.\nIn March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, announced that it will cease publication of LIBOR by June 2023.\nCertain of our credit facilities provide that, under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities, we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the U.S. market for alternative benchmarks. Such an alternative benchmark rate could include the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nInformation regarding the Companys transactions are set forth in Note 9.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of major accounting policies\nOrganization\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company), is a global leader in retail pharmacy and is positioning itself to become a leading provider of healthcare services. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare. See Note 17. Segment reporting and Note 18. Sales, for further information.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest and certain Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the equity-method of accounting for equity investments in less than majority-owned companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experiences and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including estimates of the impact of COVID-19. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that require consideration of estimates and assumptions in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of fiscal 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Companys carrying value of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets. The Companys future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Companys consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ.\nThe impact of COVID-19, the influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payor and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, changes in laws and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Companys operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years.\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the majority of the Company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Companys retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe (Disposal Group) to AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen). The Disposal Group met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Therefore, the operating results of the Disposal Group are reported as discontinued operations for all prior periods.\nEffective as of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company is aligned into three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the Companys business activities, structure and strategy. The United States segment was renamed to U.S. Retail Pharmacy and the Walgreens Health segment was renamed to U.S. Healthcare. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. The information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names. See Note 17. Segment reporting for further information.\nUnless otherwise specified, disclosures in these Consolidated Financial Statements reflect continuing operations only. Certain prior period data, primarily related to discontinued operations, have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2. Discontinued operations, for further information.\nCertain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for all periods presented.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables, which generally settle within one to seven business days, of $127 million and $146 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 66\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestricted cash and other cash flows from operating activities\nRestricted cash\nThe Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations.\nThe following represents a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, (in millions):\nAugust 31, 2022 August 31, 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,358 $ 559\nMarketable securities 1,114 634\nRestricted cash - (included in other current assets) 86 77\nCash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash $ 2,558 $ 1,270\nOther cash flows from operating activities\nOther cash flows from operating activities of $(146) million for fiscal 2022 include gains on sale-leaseback transactions of $619 million offset by long-lived asset impairment of $380 million. Other cash flows from operating activities of $(64) million for fiscal 2021 include gains on sale-leaseback transactions of $367 million offset by asset impairment of $203 million. Other cash flows from operating activities of $464 million for fiscal 2020 include asset impairment of $462 million offset by gains on sale-leaseback transactions of $308 million.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily consist of trade receivables due from customers and amounts due from third-party payors (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies). Trade receivables were $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other accounts receivable balances, which consist primarily of receivables from vendors and manufacturers, including receivables from AmerisourceBergen (see Note 19. Related parties), were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCharges for the Companys expected credit losses are recognized based upon all available information regarding the collectability of receivables, including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the short contractual life of the receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses for trade receivables at August 31, 2022 and 2021 were $66 million and $53 million, respectively.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, distribution of products, and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.\nThe Companys U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method was $6.5 billion and $6.2 billion at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At August 31, 2022 and 2021, U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory would have been greater by $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, if it had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (FIFO) cost and net realizable value.\nThe Companys International segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the FIFO method. The total carrying value of the inventory for International segment was $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Leasehold improvements, equipment under finance lease and finance lease properties are amortized over their respective estimated useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The majority of the Companys fixtures and equipment is depreciated under the composite method of depreciation.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 67\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the Companys property, plant and equipment (in millions) and estimated useful lives (in years):\nEstimated useful life 2022 2021\nLand and land improvements 20 $ 2,333 $ 2,782\nBuildings and building improvements 3 to 50\n6,996 7,453\nFixtures and equipment 3 to 20\n9,375 9,974\nCapitalized system development costs and software 3 to 10\n3,087 2,802\nAssets under construction 1\n1,785 1,294\nFinance lease properties 996 1,016\n$ 24,572 $ 25,321\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization 12,843 13,073\nBalance at end of year $ 11,729 $ 12,247\n1.In fiscal 2022, Assets under construction have been presented separately. Prior period data has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe Company capitalizes application development stage costs for internally developed software. These costs are amortized over a three to ten year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $307 million, $284 million and $300 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unamortized costs were $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment, including capitalized system development costs and software was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain retail stores, primary care clinics, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land and equipment. Initial terms for leased premises in the United States are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five-year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options.\nThe lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Companys economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 68\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nSee Note 5. Leases, for further information.\nBusiness combinations\nThe Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. If the Company obtains new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nVariable interest entities\nThe Company consolidates certain subsidiaries of Village Practice Management Company, LLC (VillageMD) which are clinical entities and managed services organizations (collectively, the Entities) where VillageMD has a controlling financial interest. The Entities were established to employ healthcare providers, contract with payors, or to deliver healthcare services to patients and are designed to comply with certain regulatory and legal requirements.\nThe Company generally has no equity interests in the Entities. The Entities are variable interest entities because there is insufficient equity at-risk in the Entities to finance their operations without additional financial support. The Company's service agreements (SAs) are variable interests in the Entities because they transfer substantially all the residual risks and rewards of ownership in the Entities to the Company.\nThe Company has the power to direct the activities of the Entities that most significantly impact their economic performance through the SAs. The activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the Entities pertain to establishing the scope of services provided, fees charged for clinical services, and managing policies and procedures related to management of the Companys patient population.\nThe SAs generally provide the Company with rights to substantially all the earnings of the Entities and obligate the Company to fund losses of the Entities. As a result, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the Entities and consolidates the Entities. The assets and liabilities of the Entities and the Entities results of operations are presented in the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nThe Entities revenues consist of amounts recognized for services provided to patients. Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of provider compensation expenses as well as clinical operating and support costs. The Company is also exposed to the risk of loss from the Entities involvement with risk-based arrangements.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units. Reporting units are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.\nThe Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Companys fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 69\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSee Note 7. Goodwill and other intangible assets, for additional disclosure regarding the Companys intangible assets.\nEquity method investments\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.\nThe Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.\nSee Note 6. Equity method investments, for further information.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to market risks, including interest rate and currency risks, arising from operating and financing risks. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nDerivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies:\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same line item, generally interest expense, net.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings and is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nCash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 70\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.\nPension and post-retirement benefits\nThe Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nThe Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The Company records the service cost component of net pension cost and net post-retirement healthcare benefit cost in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company records all other net cost components of net pension cost and net post-retirement benefit cost in Other income, net. The post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.\nSee Note 14. Retirement benefits, for further information.\nRedeemable non-controlling interests\nThe Company presents non-controlling interests in temporary equity within its Consolidated Balance Sheets if it is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date on the option of the holder, or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the Company.\nThe carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interests is equal to the greater of the carrying value of non-controlling interests adjusted each reporting period for income (or loss) attributable to the non-controlling interests as well as any applicable distributions made or the redemption value. Re-measurements to the redemption value of the redeemable non-controlling interests are recognized in additional paid in capital. The Company reports the portion of its earnings or loss for redeemable non-controlling interest as Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests - continuing operations, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe following is a roll forward of the redeemable non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nAugust 31, 2020 $ -\nRecognition upon acquisition of subsidiary 309\nRedemption price adjustments 1\nNet loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (3)\nCurrency translation adjustments and other (6)\nAugust 31, 2021 $ 319\nRecognition upon acquisition of subsidiary 2\n2,684\nAcquisition of non-controlling interests 3\n(2,047)\nRedemption price adjustments 1\nNet loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (73)\nCurrency translation adjustments and other (20)\nAugust 31, 2022 4\n$ 1,042\n1.Remeasurement of non-controlling interests, probable of redemption but not currently redeemable, to their redemption value, is recorded to Paid in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 71\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2.Includes, $1.9 billion of redeemable non-controlling interests, representing the maximum purchase price to redeem non-controlling units in VillageMD for cash, and redeemable non-controlling interests in Shields Health Solutions Parent, LLC (Shields) and CCX Next, LLC (CareCentrix).\n3.Includes, $1.9 billion paid to existing shareholders of VillageMD as part of the fully subscribed tender offer and the acquisition of the remaining 30% non-controlling equity interests in the pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany.\n4.Redeemable non-controlling interests primarily relates to Shields, CareCentrix, and Innovation Associates, Inc.\nSee Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments, for further details.\nNon-controlling interests\nThe Company presents non-controlling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the portion of its earnings or loss for non-controlling interest as net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Non-controlling interests primarily relates to VillageMD.\nCurrency\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated primarily at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAssets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at end-of-period exchange rates, except for non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are generally included in Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nCommitments and contingencies\nThe Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Companys assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Managements assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to managements assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. See Note 11. Commitments and contingencies, for further information.\nRevenue recognition\nSales are recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of goods or services to the customer. Sales are reported on the gross amount billed to a customer less discounts if it has earned revenue as a principal from the sale of goods and services. Sales are reported on the net amount retained (i.e., the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a vendor) if the Company has earned a commission or a fee as an agent.\nRetail and Pharmacy\nThe Company recognizes revenue, net of taxes and expected returns, at the time it sells merchandise, provides services or dispenses prescription drugs to the customer. The Company estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) for dispensing prescription drugs. The estimates are based on all available information including historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 72\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Companys loyalty rewards programs represent separate performance obligations and are accounted for using the deferred revenue approach. When goods are sold, the transaction price is allocated between goods sold and loyalty points awarded based upon the relative standalone selling price. The revenue allocated to the loyalty points is recognized upon redemption. Loyalty programs breakage is recognized as revenue based on the redemption pattern. Customer purchases of the Company's own gift cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed. Gift card breakage (i.e., unused gift card) is recognized as revenue based on the redemption pattern.\nThe Company recognizes contract liabilities to record the Companys obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, for example the Companys myWalgreens and Boots Advantage Card loyalty programs. Under such programs, customers earn Walgreens Cash or reward points on purchases for redemption at a later date.\nWholesale\nWholesale revenue is recognized, net of taxes and expected returns, upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery.\nHealthcare services\nThe Company provides healthcare services under fee-for-service and value-based arrangements. Fee-for-service revenues are recognized at the point-in-time medical care is provided. Revenues are reported based on expected net collection rates, which are calculated based on historical collection rates in relation to amounts billed at the time of service. Revenues from value-based arrangements (risk-based revenues) are primarily earned from contracts in which the Company has full or shared risk for the healthcare payors eligible members (value-based patients). Risk-based revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract (generally, one year or less) as our stand-ready obligation to provide healthcare services is satisfied. We receive fees from payors which are generally based on a fixed monthly percentage of the premium received by the payor from the payors members, or a portion of the payors savings relative to an agreed-upon financial benchmark. We estimate transaction price based on historical data and data from the payors. Estimates are adjusted to the final settlement amount received from the payor. The Company evaluates whether it is a principal or agent in an arrangement based on the Companys exposure to financial risk under the arrangement and the Companys control over the provision of services. The Company has determined that it acts as a principal in the vast majority of its arrangements.\nCost of sales\nRetail, Pharmacy and Wholesale\nCost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. Cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.\nVendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of Selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the suppliers products purchased by the Company.\nHealthcare services\nFor operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization. Medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers that provide medical care to patients. Cost of care represents the cost of our employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses and provider benefits. Clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate our clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 73\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, if reimbursement represents a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, and expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses, were $862 million in fiscal 2022, $772 million in fiscal 2021 and $532 million in fiscal 2020.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. Long-lived assets related to the Companys retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.\nImpairment charges for long-lived assets included in Selling, general and administrative expenses were $380 million, $182 million and $401 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\nThe determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nStock compensation plans\nStock based compensation is measured at fair value at the grant date. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive service period. The fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent. Subsequently, the Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance goals and vesting and adjusts compensation expense accordingly, including the reversal of previously recognized compensation expense if it is no longer probable that the awards will vest. See Note 13. Stock compensation plans, for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans.\nInsurance\nThe Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Companys U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Companys estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 74\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nEarnings per share\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. There were 17.1 million, 17.2 million and 19.0 million weighted outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nAdoption of new accounting pronouncements\nReceivables - nonrefundable fees and others\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other. This ASU clarifies the accounting for the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium by giving consideration to securities which have multiple call dates. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nInvestments - equity securities; Investments - equity method and joint ventures; Derivatives and hedging\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in this ASU clarify the interaction between the accounting for investments in equity securities, investment in equity method and certain derivatives instruments. The ASU is expected to reduce diversity in practice and increase comparability of the accounting for these interactions. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIncome taxes - simplifying the accounting for income taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), which removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nEffects of reference rate reform on financial reporting\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable, or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. The ASU provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, which adds implementation guidance to the above ASU to clarify certain optional expedients in Topic 848. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 75\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNew accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nAcquired contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). This ASU is expected to reduce diversity in practice and increase comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024). The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.\nDisclosures by business entities about government assistance\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This ASU requires disclosures that are expected to increase the transparency of transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entitys financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company will adopt this ASU on September 1, 2022.\nLiabilities-Supplier Finance Programs\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. This ASU requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the programs nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. This ASU is expected to improve financial reporting by requiring new disclosures about the programs, thereby allowing financial statement users to better consider the effect of the programs on an entitys working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 (fiscal 2024), except for the amendment on roll forward information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 (fiscal 2025). The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.\nNote 2.

The transaction resulted in the Company recording a pre-tax gain of $417 million in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, including a $32 million loss reclassified from within Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the Companys investment being classified within the operating income of its U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings (loss) from AmerisourceBergen are reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 84\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized equity earnings (losses) in AmerisourceBergen of $418 million, $(1.1) billion and $341 million, respectively. The equity losses for fiscal 2021 were primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of a loss of $5.6 billion, net of tax, related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nThe Level 1 fair market value of the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. As of August 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $3.9 billion. This premium of $3.9 billion is recognized as part of the carrying value in the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference is primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.\nOther investments\nThe Companys other equity method investments primarily include its U.S. investments in Option Care Health, through its subsidiary HC Group Holdings I, LLC (HC Group Holdings), and BrightSpring Health Services, and the Companys investments in China in Sinopharm Medicine Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd, Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Company Limited.\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company sold 11.0 million shares of Option Care Health common stock for a total consideration of $363 million, decreasing the Company's ownership of Option Care Healths common stock from 20.5% to 14.4% at August 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $145 million in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Subsequent to the sale, the Company continues to account for its investment using the equity method of accounting.\nThe Company reported $50 million, $627 million and $31 million of post-tax equity earnings from other equity method investments, for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the Company also recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $124 million related to an equity method investment in China. The impairment was derived using Level 3 inputs, including financial projections and market multiples of comparable companies.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company acquired majority equity interests in VillageMD and Shields. The Company accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations resulting in the remeasurement of its previously held minority equity interests and convertible debt securities at fair value resulting in pre-tax gains of $2.2 billion and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields, respectively, recognized in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As a result of these transactions, the Company now consolidates VillageMD and Shields within the U.S. Healthcare segment in its financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $290 million in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, due to the partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's then equity method investee HC Group Holdings. As a result of these sales HC Group Holdings lost the ability to control Option Care Health and, therefore, deconsolidated Option Care Health in its financial statements. As a result of this deconsolidation, HC Group Holdings recognized a gain of $1.2 billion and the Company recorded its share of equity earnings in HC Group Holdings of $576 million in Post-tax earnings from other equity method investments.\nSummarized financial information\nSummarized financial information for the Companys equity method investments in aggregate is as follows:\nBalance sheet (in millions)\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nCurrent assets $ 50,985 $ 49,538\nNon-current assets 26,497 27,442\nCurrent liabilities 52,083 48,766\nNon-current liabilities 19,712 22,046\nShareholders equity 1\n5,687 6,168\n1Shareholders equity at August 31, 2022 and 2021 includes $564 million and $646 million, respectively, related to non-controlling interests.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 85\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

Goodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value.\nBased on the analysis completed as of the June 1, 2022 valuation date, the fair values of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 7% to approximately 198%. The Boots reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 7%, compared to 18% as of June 1, 2021. As of August 31, 2022, the carrying value of goodwill within the Boots reporting unit was $906 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded, within Selling, general and administrative expenses, an impairment loss of $783 million, related to indefinite-lived pharmacy license and trade name intangible assets in the Boots reporting unit, part of the International segment. Due to the impairment recognized in fiscal 2022, the fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit equate to their carrying values. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit was $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company recorded, within Selling, general and administrative expenses, an impairment loss in the International segment of $49 million on certain indefinite-lived trade name assets of Boots.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within the International segment, Boots and International Other, as a result of the significant impact of COVID-19 on their financial performance. Based on this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on Boots goodwill and $294 million on certain indefinite lived trade name assets of Boots, in the International segment, within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Companys reporting units. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions, as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts and economic, industry and market trends, and the impact these may have on the reporting units.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset or asset group may be impaired. In fiscal 2020, the Company evaluated certain definite-lived intangibles for impairment resulting in an impairment charge of $47 million. No impairment was recorded for definite-lived intangibles in fiscal 2022 or 2021.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 86\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

Interest paid in fiscal 2022 and 2021 included charges on early extinguishment of debt of $6 million and $387 million, respectively.\nNote 9. Financial instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to market risks, including interest rate and currency risks, arising from operating and financing risks. The Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk.\nThe notional amounts and fair value of derivative instruments outstanding were as follows (in millions):\nAugust 31, 2022 Notional Fair value Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets\nDerivatives designated as hedges:\nForeign currency forwards $ 448 $ 19 Other current assets\nCross currency interest rate swaps 150 12 Other current assets\nCross currency interest rate swaps 750 83 Other non-current assets\nForeign currency forwards 3 - Other non-current assets\nForeign currency forwards 221 1 Other current liabilities\nDerivatives not designated as hedges:\nForeign currency forwards $ 2,874 $ 49 Other current assets\nForeign currency forwards 1,098 6 Other current liabilities\nTotal return swap 183 6 Other current liabilities\nAugust 31, 2021 Notional Fair value Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets\nDerivatives designated as hedges:\nForeign currency forwards $ 575 $ 7 Other current assets\nCross currency interest rate swaps 155 1 Other non-current assets\nForeign currency forwards 6 - Other non-current assets\nForeign currency forwards 31 1 Other current liabilities\nCross currency interest rate swaps 109 9 Other current liabilities\nCross currency interest rate swaps 801 23 Other non-current liabilities\nForeign currency forwards 23 1 Other non-current liabilities\nDerivatives not designated as hedges:\nForeign currency forwards $ 3,636 $ 38 Other current assets\nTotal return swap 224 2 Other current assets\nForeign currency forwards 808 3 Other current liabilities\nTotal return swap 37 - Other current liabilities\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 91\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNet investment hedges\nThe Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash flow hedges\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows of certain floating-rate debt. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and released to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges\nThe Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of foreign currency risks. The Company also utilizes total return swaps to economically hedge variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations.\nThe income (expense) due to changes in fair value of these derivative instruments were recognized in earnings as follows (in millions):\nLocation in Consolidated Statements of Earnings 2022 2021 2020\nForeign currency forwards Selling, general and administrative expense 1\n$ - $ (75) $ (63)\nTotal return swap Selling, general and administrative expense (33) 58 24\nForeign currency forwards Other income, net 1,2\n523 (8) 11\n1.In fiscal 2022, certain expenses related to derivative instruments used as economic hedges, were presented as Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, whereas these expenses were recorded within Selling, general, and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in prior periods.\n2.Excludes remeasurement gains and losses on economically hedged assets and liabilities.\nDerivatives credit risk\nCounterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty.\nDerivatives offsetting\nThe Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 10. Fair value measurements\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad Levels:\nLevel 1 -Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2 -Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.\nLevel 3 -Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 92\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

See Note 9. Financial instruments, for additional information.\n3The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves. See Note 9. Financial instruments, for additional information.\n4Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of August 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021.\n5Level 3 debt securities include investments in convertible debt securities of VillageMD which are valued on a quarterly basis using the Probability Weighted Expect Return Method with gains or losses recorded in Other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inputs include the enterprise value, expected holding term of the investment, volatility and risk-free interest rates.\n6Includes investments in Treasury debt securities.\nThere were no transfers between Levels in fiscal 2022 or 2021.\nThe carrying value of the Company's commercial paper and credit facilities approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.\nThe Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Companys debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of August 31, 2022, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of long term notes outstanding including the current portion were $7.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.\nThe fair values of the notes outstanding are Level 1 fair value measures and determined based on quoted market price and translated at the August 31, 2022 rate, as applicable. The fair values and carrying values of these issuances do not include notes that have been redeemed or repaid as of August 31, 2022. See Note. 8 Debt, for further information. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 93\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 11. Commitments and contingencies\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, subpoenas, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities in pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other areas. Some of these proceedings may be class actions, and some involve claims for large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and they may remain unresolved for several years. Legal proceedings in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive.\nFrom time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. The Companys business, compliance and reporting practices are subject to intensive scrutiny under applicable regulation, including review or audit by regulatory authorities. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described herein. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private parties. In such an action, a private party purports to act on behalf of federal or state governments, alleges that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if its claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on its own purporting to act on behalf of the government.\nThe results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs.\nWe describe below certain proceedings against the Company in which the amount of loss could be material. We accrue for legal claims when, and to the extent that, the amount or range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have meritorious defenses in each of these proceedings, and we intend to defend each case vigorously, but there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined a material loss is reasonably possible, except as otherwise disclosed, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that is reasonably possible above any accrued amounts in these proceedings, due to various reasons, including: we have factual and legal arguments that, if successful, will eliminate or sharply reduce the possibility of loss; we do not have sufficient information about the arguments and the evidence plaintiffs will advance with respect to their damages; some of the cases have been stayed; certain proceedings present novel and complex questions of public policy; legal and factual determinations and judicial and governmental procedure; the large number of parties involved; and the inherent uncertainties related to such litigations.\nLitigation Relating to 2016 Goals\nOn December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co. and Walgreen Co., as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. (Cutler v. Wasson et al., No. 1:14-cv-10408 (N.D. Ill.)) The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015, described below. On November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the resolution of the securities class action.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 94\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. (Washtenaw County Employees Retirement System v. Walgreen Co. et al., No. 1:15-cv-3187 (N.D. Ill.)) The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The Companys motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint filed on August 17, 2015 was granted in part and denied in part on September 30, 2016. The court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification on March 29, 2018, and plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on December 19, 2018. A motion to dismiss the first amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part on September 23, 2019. Fact discovery and expert discovery have concluded. On November 2, 2021, the Court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants cross motion. On March 2, 2022 the Court granted the Companys motion to reconsider a portion of that ruling. On June 29, 2022 the Court granted preliminary approval of a settlement in the amount of $105 million which was fully accrued at August 31, 2022. The Court issued a final judgment order approving the settlement on October 13, 2022.\nSecurities Claims Relating to Rite-Aid Merger\nOn December 11, 2017, purported Rite Aid shareholders filed an amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the M.D. Pa. class action) arising out of transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between the Company and Rite Aid. The amended complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements regarding the transactions. The Court denied the Companys motion to dismiss the amended complaint on April 15, 2019. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses, and the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Fact and expert discovery have concluded and summary judgement briefing is complete. In October and December 2020, two separate purported Rite Aid Shareholders filed actions in the same court opting out of the class in the M.D. Pa. class action and making nearly identical allegations as those in the M.D. Pa. class action (the Opt-out Actions). The Opt-out Actions have been stayed until the earlier of (a) 30 days after the entry of an order resolving any pre-trial dispositive motions in the M.D. Pa. class action, or (b) 30 days after the entry of an order of final approval of any settlement of the M.D. Pa. class action.\nClaims Relating to Opioid Abuse\nThe Company is among an array of defendants in multiple actions in federal courts alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse, which have been commenced by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and others. In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated many of these cases in a consolidated multidistrict litigation, captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804, Case No. 17-md-2804), which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (N.D. Ohio). The Company is a defendant in the following multidistrict litigation (MDL) bellwether cases:\nOne case remanded to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (City and Cnty. of San Francisco, et al. v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-07591-CRB). Following a bench trial, the court entered a liability finding against Walgreens in August 2022. The court has scheduled a second trial regarding remedies for November 2022 at which time the court will determine how much is to be paid. The Company has the right to appeal any judgment but is unable to predict the outcome relative to remedies or apportionment as well as the outcome of any appeal as the trial is ongoing.\nTwo cases in N.D. Ohio (Cnty. of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., Case No. 18-op-45032; Cnty. of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., Case No. 18-op-45079). In November 2021, the jury in that case returned a verdict after trial in favor of the plaintiffs as to liability, and a second trial regarding remedies took place in May 2022. In August 2022, the court entered orders providing for injunctive relief and requiring the defendants to pay $650.6 million over a 15-year period to fund abatement programs. The court found that the damages are subject to joint and several liability and as such made no determination as to apportionment. These decisions are currently on appeal.\nOne case remanded to the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma (The Cherokee Nation v. McKesson Corp., et al., Case No. 18-CV-00056-RAW-SPS), which has since been remanded to the District Court of Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, in a decision that is on appeal. The court has indicated that trial will commence in March 2023.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 95\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

Purdue Pharma L.P., Case No. 18-op-45004), previously scheduled for trial in November 2020 but postponed indefinitely.\nThe Company also has been named as a defendant in numerous actions brought in state courts relating to opioid matters. Trial dates have been set in cases pending in state courts in the following states:\nNew Mexico (State of New Mexico, ex rel. Hector Balderas, Attorney General v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., Case No. D-101-cv-2017-02541, First Judicial District Court, Santa Fe County, New Mexico - September 2022, currently ongoing).\nWest Virginia (State of West Virginia, ex rel.

Fisher, et al., Case No. CV-2019-902806.00, Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama - scheduled for trial in January 2023, but currently stayed pending a petition to the Alabama Supreme Court).\nNevada (State of Nevada v. McKesson Corporation, et al., Case No. A-19-796755-B, Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada - April 2023).\nMissouri (Jefferson County, Missouri v. Dannie E. Williams, M.D., et al., Case No. 20JE-CC00029, Twenty-Third Judicial Circuit, Jefferson County, Missouri - April 2024).\nFlorida (Florida Health Sciences Center, Inc., et al. v. Richard Sackler, et al., Case No. CACE 19-018882, Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court, Broward County, Florida - October 2024).\nTwo consolidated cases in New York state court (County of Suffolk v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., Index No. 400001/2017; County of Nassau v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al., Index No. 400008/2017, Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County, New York) were resolved as to the Company in June 2021.\nThe relief sought by various plaintiffs in these matters includes compensatory, abatement, restitution and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. In connection with these matters, the Company has engaged an expanded number of parties regarding possible resolution. Significant uncertainties remain. Additionally, the Company has received from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of numerous states subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and other requests concerning opioid-related matters. The Company continues to communicate with the Department of Justice with respect to purported violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act in dispensing opioid prescriptions at certain Walgreens locations.\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Companys pharmacies in the State of Florida. This settlement agreement is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by the state and government subdivisions in the State of Florida. The estimated settlement amount of $683 million includes $620 million in remediation payments, which will be paid to the State of Florida in equal installments over 18 years, and will be applied as opioid remediation, as well as a one-time payment of $63 million for attorneys fees. The Company made the first annual settlement payment of $97.4 million into escrow on June 17, 2022. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a $683 million liability associated with this settlement. The settlement accrual is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings within Selling, general and administrative expenses as part of the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 96\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 12. Income taxes\nU.S. tax law changes\nOn August 16, 2022, the United States government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA establishes a new corporate alternative minimum tax based on financial statement income adjusted for certain items. The new minimum tax is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 (fiscal 2024). The enactment of the IRA did not have a material impact to the Companys financial statements.\nDuring 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued regulations to apply retroactively covering certain components of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Certain guidance included in these regulations is inconsistent with the Companys interpretation that led to the recognition of $247 million of tax benefits in prior periods. The tax benefits relate to the Companys one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which was enacted as part of the 2017 U.S. tax law changes. Despite this guidance, the Company remains confident in its interpretation of the U.S. tax law changes and intends to defend this position through litigation, if necessary. However, if the Company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position, it may be required to reverse all or a portion of the benefits previously recorded.\nUK tax law changes\nOn June 10, 2021, the UK Finance Act 2021 was enacted increasing the UK tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. The Company recorded tax expense of $344 million from re-measuring the net UK deferred tax liability in fiscal 2021. On July 22, 2020, the UK Finance Bill 2020 was enacted increasing the UK tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020. The Company recorded tax expense of $139 million from re-measuring the net UK deferred tax liability in fiscal 2020.\nThe components of earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision were (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nU.S. $ 2,998 $ 61 $ 759\nNon-U.S. 987 1,934 (313)\nTotal $ 3,985 $ 1,995 $ 446\nThe provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of the following (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrent provision\nFederal $ 39 $ 79 $ 184\nState 37 115 49\nNon-U.S. 260 234 135\n$ 336 $ 428 $ 368\nDeferred provision\nFederal $ (78) $ (10) $ (83)\nState (20) (46) 2\nNon-U.S. - tax law change - 344 139\nNon-U.S. - excluding tax law change (268) (49) (87)\n(366) 239 (29)\nIncome tax (benefit) provision $ (30) $ 667 $ 339\nThe Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a 0.8% benefit and 33.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to pre-tax gains from the consolidation of the Companys investments in VillageMD and Shields, for which a majority of these gains were not subject to tax. Additionally, the Company recognized tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care, capital gains recognized from internal restructuring, and based on forecasted capital gains.

In addition, these deferred tax assets include $91 million of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets, $7.3 billion will expire at various dates from 2023 through 2039. The residual deferred tax assets of $483 million have no expiration date.\nThe Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. The assessment of realization of deferred tax assets is performed based on the weight of the positive and negative evidence available to indicate whether the asset is recoverable, including tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $7.5 billion against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2022.\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds were $387 million, $336 million and $626 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, unrecognized tax benefits of $618 million and $594 million were reported as long-term liabilities; $473 million and $475 million were reported against deferred taxes; and $116 million and $114 million were reported against related tax receivables in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 99\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of year $ 1,098 $ 494 $ 455\nGross increases related to tax positions in a prior period 63 229 60\nGross decreases related to tax positions in a prior period (51) (52) (23)\nGross increases related to tax positions in the current period 21 446 9\nSettlements with taxing authorities (19) (13) (4)\nLapse of statute of limitations (2) (6) (3)\nBalance at end of year $ 1,110 $ 1,098 $ 494\nAt August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, $529 million, $524 million and $353 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $136 million due to anticipated federal and state tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple state tax jurisdictions.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $97 million and $84 million, respectively. For the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the amounts reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties were $13 million, $26 million and $11 million, respectively.\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examinations for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2014. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2008. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in the UK prior to 2015, Luxembourg prior to 2017 and in Germany prior to 2014.\nThe Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays expired in September 2022. Upon expiration, a reduced tax rate will extend through December 2029. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $104 million, $118 million and $124 million (inclusive of capital GILTI tax cost) during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above.\nAt August 31, 2022, it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration.\nNote 13. Stock compensation plans\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2021 Omnibus Plan). The 2021 Omnibus Plan replicates the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan and provides incentive compensation to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and other eligible employees.\nThe Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the 2021 Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the 2021 Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive equity awards to certain employees. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with vesting requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability. Stock-based compensation expense associated with such plans for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $133 million, $155 million and $137 million, respectively.\nCertain majority-owned subsidiaries within the U.S. Healthcare segment maintain standalone stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense associated with such plans for fiscal 2022 was $269 million, including the impact of fair value adjustments resulting from acquisitions. Awards granted under standalone stock-based compensation plans include subsidiary units, profits interests, and options. Awards generally vest over time or subject to achievement of certain subsidiary performance targets. Certain awards accelerate vesting upon a change in control or upon the Companys acquisition of additional subsidiary equity above a certain threshold.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 100\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards, inclusive of awards issued under the 2021 Omnibus Plan and the standalone subsidiary stock compensation plans, was $399 million at August 31, 2022, which will be fully recognized over the next three years.\nNote 14. Retirement benefits\nThe Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a post-retirement health plan.\nDefined benefit pension plans (non-U.S. plans)\nThe Company has various defined benefit pension plans outside the U.S. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan (the Boots Plan), which covers certain employees in the UK. The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010, with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold the majority of its assets in a diverse portfolio (\"Matching Portfolio\") which aims to broadly match the characteristics of the plans liabilities by investing in bonds, derivatives and other fixed income assets, with the remainder invested in predominantly return-seeking assets. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management.\nThe following tables present classes of defined benefit pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy (in millions):\nAugust 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nEquity securities:\nEquity securities 1\n$ 967 $ - $ 967 $ -\nDebt securities:\nFixed interest government bonds 2\n688 402 285 -\nIndex linked government bonds 2\n1,785 1,785 - -\nCorporate bonds 3\n1,980 - 1,980 -\nReal estate:\nReal estate 4\n548 - - 548\nOther:\nOther investments, net 5\n636 10 (87) 713\nTotal $ 6,603 $ 2,197 $ 3,145 $ 1,261\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 101\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 investments. If closing prices are not available, or the investments are in a commingled fund, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price and typically are categorized as Level 2 investments.\n2Debt securities: government bonds comprise of fixed interest and index linked bonds issued by central governments and are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices.\n3Debt securities: corporate bonds comprise bonds issued by corporations in both segregated and commingled funds\nand are valued using recently executed transactions, or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices.\n4Real estate comprise of investments in certain property funds which are valued based on the underlying properties. These properties are valued using a number of standard industry techniques such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Real estate investments are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2022 were driven by actual return on plan assets still held at August 31, 2022 and purchases during the year.\n5Other investments mainly comprise of net receivable (payable) amounts for unsettled transactions, cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, insurance linked securities and direct private placements. Cash is categorized as a Level 1 investment and cash in commingled funds is categorized as Level 2 investments. Amounts receivable (payable) are categorized as level 2 investments. Cash equivalents are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Derivatives which are exchange-traded and for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market, or exchange on which they are traded, and are categorized as Level 1 investments. Over-the-counter derivatives typically are valued by independent pricing services and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Insurance linked securities are categorized as Level 2. Direct private placements are typically bonds valued by reference to comparable bonds and are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2022 were primarily driven by purchases during the year.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 102\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

The Companys contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is made pursuant to the applicable plan document approved by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors. Plan activity is reviewed periodically by certain Committees of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision is an expense of $234 million, $221 million and $227 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Companys contributions were $236 million, $222 million and $226 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is UK based to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was $90 million, $101 million and $91 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPost-retirement healthcare plan\nThe Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. The Companys post-retirement health benefit plan obligation was $122 million and $154 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid is $9 million.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 104\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 15. Capital stock\nIn June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the June 2018 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock, which program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it had suspended activities under this program and no shares were repurchased in fiscal 2021 or 2022. As of August 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $2.0 billion remaining under the June 2018 stock repurchase program.\nThe Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.\nIn addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $187 million, $110 million and $103 million were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Segment reporting\nIn conjunction with the launch of its new consumer-centric healthcare strategy, in fiscal 2022, the Company announced the creation of a new operating segment Walgreens Health. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2022, the Company aligned to three reportable segments: United States, International and Walgreens Health.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the Companys business activities, structure and strategy. The United States segment was renamed to U.S. Retail Pharmacy and the Walgreens Health segment was renamed to U.S. Healthcare. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. The information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names..\nAs a result of the change, the Company is now aligned into three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare.\nThe operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Companys operating segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included.\nU.S. Retail Pharmacy\nThe Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment includes the Walgreens business which is comprised of the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, specialty and home delivery pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise.\nInternational\nThe Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and a pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.\nU.S. Healthcare\nThe Companys U.S. Healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.\nThe U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in VillageMD, a leading national provider of value-based primary care services; a majority position in Shields, a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals; a majority position in CareCentrix, a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors, and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members caregivers through both digital and physical channels.\nSelling, general and administrative costs for the U.S. Healthcare segment for fiscal 2021 have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe results of operations for reportable segments include procurement benefits. Corporate-related overhead costs are not allocated to reportable segments and are reported in Corporate and Other.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 107\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

The Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 45% equity interest for approximately $392 million of cash consideration. The acquisition is subject to limited customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 2023.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 112\nManagements Report on Internal Control\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting excludes internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances.\nAdditionally, the scope of managements evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting at VillageMD, Shields and CareCentrix within the U.S. Healthcare segment, as described in Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staffs general guidance that an assessment of a business may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022. The acquisition of these businesses represented approximately 2.2% of the Companys total assets as of August 31, 2022 after excluding goodwill and intangibles assets recorded, and 1.4% of the Companys sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022.\nBased on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2022. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.\n/s/ Rosalind G. Brewer /s/ James Kehoe\nRosalind G. Brewer James Kehoe\nChief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer\nOctober 13, 2022\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 113\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 13, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment -Boots Reporting Unit and Certain Boots Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company uses the income and the market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units in its goodwill impairment analysis. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach requires management to estimate fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping or a comparable marketplace transactional multiple. The Company primarily uses the multi-period excess earnings model and the relief from royalty model to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Changes in assumptions or the selection of companies in the comparable industry group could have a significant impact on the valuation of the reporting units and the amount of a goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, if any.\nWe identified the valuation of the Boots Reporting Unit and certain Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical audit matter due to the materiality of the assets carrying values, the difference between the fair values and the carrying values, and because the current economic environment has affected the business. Auditing managements judgments used in the quantitative assessment regarding significant assumptions related to future revenue growth, EBITDA margins, the selection of the discount rate, the selection of the royalty rates for the Boots trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets, and the market multiples selected for the Boots Reporting Unit requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 114\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the fair value of goodwill for the Boots Reporting Unit and certain Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the goodwill and intangible asset impairment analyses, including those over the development of forecasts of future revenues, EBITDA margins, and the selection of royalty rates, market multiples, and discount rates.\nWe evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast future revenues and EBITDA margins by comparing actual results to managements historical forecasts.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of managements forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins by performing certain procedures, including:\n\u25e6Comparing the forecasts to internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n\u25e6Comparing the business forecasts and planned initiatives to third-party economic and industry data.\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the risk of impairment if key assumptions are changed.\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our fair value specialists, the (1) valuation methodology used for the Boots Reporting Units goodwill and the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets, and (2) the reasonableness of the related discount rates, by performing certain procedures, including:\n\u25e6Comparing the valuation methodologies used to generally accepted valuation practices for each asset type.\n\u25e6Evaluating the appropriateness of the Companys selection of companies in its industry comparable group for comparability to the Reporting Unit.\n\u25e6Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n\u25e6Developing an independent discount rate range and comparing the discount rate selected by management to this range.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has a complex legal structure involving numerous domestic and foreign locations with constantly changing tax laws and regulations. The Companys management is required to interpret and apply these tax laws and regulations in determining the amount of its income tax liability and provision. When an uncertain tax position is identified by management, the Company must evaluate whether it is more likely to be sustained than not on the basis of its technical merits. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill, knowledge, and significant judgment related to the identified position. This significant judgment includes determining the correct value of the unrecognized tax benefit based on the selected method of measurement, data, and assumptions determined by management.\nBecause of the numerous taxing jurisdictions in which the Company files its tax returns and the complexity of tax laws and regulations, auditing uncertain tax positions and the determination of whether the more likely than not threshold was met requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our income tax specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to unrecognized tax benefits included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over income taxes, including those over identifying uncertain tax positions and measuring liabilities.\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, a selection of underlying tax positions to evaluate the more likely than not principle as it applied to the specific underlying tax position.\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, the Companys unrecognized tax positions by performing the following:\n\u25e6Obtaining management and third-party opinions or memoranda regarding the analysis of uncertain tax positions and identifying the key judgments and evaluating whether the analysis was consistent with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.\n\u25e6Evaluating managements method of measuring its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including underlying data and assumptions.\n\u25e6Evaluating the basis for certain intercompany transactions, such as transfer pricing, as well as internal restructuring, by comparison to economic studies performed by management and third-party data.\n\u25e6Evaluating the matters raised by tax authorities in former and ongoing tax audits and considering the implications of these matters on open tax years.\n\u25e6Assessing changes and interpretation of applicable tax law.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 115\nCommitments and Contingencies - Opioid Abuse Litigation - Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is among an array of defendants in multiple actions in federal courts alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse, which have been commenced by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and others. The Company is named as a defendant along with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacy chains. The Company reviews all loss contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability in the amount of its estimate for the ultimate loss. The Company also performs an assessment of loss contingencies where a loss is reasonably possible. If it is reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred and the effect on the financial statements could be material, the Company discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made within the notes to the financial statements. As of August 31, 2022, the Company has determined that a liability associated with these claims, whether through settlement or litigation, is not probable and a loss or range of loss is not reasonably estimable.\nWe identified litigation and claims involving opioid abuse as a critical audit matter because of the challenges auditing managements judgments applied in determining the likelihood of loss related to the resolution of such claims, as well as the judgment in determining a reasonable estimate of loss or a range of loss. Specifically, auditing managements determination of whether any contingent loss arising from the related litigation and claims is probable, reasonably possible, or remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment due to the large number of parties involved, together with the novelty and complexity of the issues.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to litigation and claims involving opioid abuse included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to managements review of litigation and claims involving opioid abuse, and approval of the accounting treatment and related disclosures based on the most recent facts and circumstances.\n\u25e6We inquired of the Companys internal and external legal counsel to understand the basis for the Companys conclusion that any potential loss from the litigation and claims involving opioid abuse, including through broad resolution via settlement, is neither probable nor reasonably estimable as of August 31, 2022. In addition, we requested and received a written response from internal and external legal counsel as it relates to litigation and claims involving opioid abuse.\n\u25e6We evaluated managements analysis of litigation and claims involving opioid abuse, read Board of Directors meeting minutes, including relevant sub-committee meeting minutes, and compared to responses from internal and external counsel. As part of our procedures, we made inquiries of management and the audit committee to evaluate and corroborate our understanding obtained through inquiries of internal and external legal counsel. We also performed public domain searches for evidence contrary to managements analysis.\n\u25e6We obtained and reviewed the relevant court rulings and briefs identified by management that have been filed supporting the Companys legal defenses.\n\u25e6We compared the Company's assessment of this matter to relevant history of similar legal contingencies that have been settled or otherwise resolved to evaluate the consistency of the Company's assessment of litigation and claims involving opioid abuse as of August 31, 2022.\n\u25e6We consulted with our auditing experts to assist in our evaluation of the case facts and the Companys related accounting treatment for the litigation and claims involving opioid abuse.\n\u25e6We evaluated any events subsequent to August 31, 2022 that might impact our evaluation of litigation and claims involving opioid abuse, including any related accrual or disclosure.\n\u25e6We obtained written representations from executives of the Company.\n\u25e6We read the Companys related disclosures and evaluated them for consistency with our testing.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 13, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 116\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated October 13, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Managements Report on Internal Control, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Village Practice Management Company, LLC (\"VillageMD\"), Shields Health Solutions Parent, LLC (\"Shields\"), and CCX Next, LLC (\"CareCentrix\") which were acquired during the year ended August 31, 2022. The acquisition of VillageMD, Shields and CareCentrix represented approximately 2.2% of the Companys total assets as of August 31, 2022 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and 1.4% of the Companys sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at VillageMD and Shields.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 13, 2022\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 117 Item 9. Changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a majority equity interest in VillageMD and Shields. The Company accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations resulting in consolidation within the U.S. Healthcare segment. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired businesses. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nReport on internal control over financial reporting\nManagements report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls.\nAs we transform our business processes, we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions. These changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via third-party outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems. These initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness. As these changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2022 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nWBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 118\nInherent limitations on effectiveness of controls\nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Item 9B.
