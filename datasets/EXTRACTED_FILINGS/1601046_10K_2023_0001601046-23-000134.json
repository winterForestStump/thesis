We believe that our technology leadership serves as a competitive differentiator. The proprietary software and hardware technologies unavailable in the commercial markets and developed by our R&D technology centers around the world enable many Keysight products to deliver differentiated design and measurement solution capability to address our customers' engineering requirements. We compete with a variety of organizations that offer similar services and solutions, but none of our competitors offer the full range of product and services at the scale we do or serve all the same markets in the aggregate or by segment. Our competitors include companies or divisions of companies with substantial sales, marketing, research, and financial capabilities, as well as well-established regional competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets. We also face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new competitors or consolidation among industries or customers. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\nRisks Related to Our Business\nUncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Global and regional economic uncertainty, inflation, potential recession or depression has and may continue to impact our business, resulting in:\nincreased cost to manufacture products or deliver solutions;\nreduced customer purchasing power;\nreduced demand for our solutions and services and reduced or delayed orders;\nincreased risk of excess and obsolete inventory;\nincreased price pressure for our solutions and services; and\ngreater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our future investment portfolio.\nIn addition, global and regional macroeconomic developments, such as increased unemployment, decreased income, uncertainty related to future economic activity, volatility in financial markets, reduced access to credit, increased interest rates, volatility in capital markets, decreased liquidity, uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, and Asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories. Financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers, including distributors, due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays, reduced purchasing power, delays in payment or inability to pay us, and inventory issues. Economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.\nEconomic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause we operate our businesses and sell our solutions worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. However, there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\ninability to conduct business in certain countries or regions or with certain customers due to U.S. sanctions or trade restrictions;\ninability to sell certain products, technologies, or services to countries, regions, facilities, or customers due to U.S. sanctions or trade restrictions;\nchanges in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions, including but not limited to changes that favor national interests and economic volatility;\nnegative impact of economic and political measures taken by a country to contain the spread of global pandemic conditions;\nnegative consequences from changes in tax laws;\ndifficulty in protecting intellectual property;\ninjunctions or exclusion orders related to intellectual property disputes;\ninterruptions to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\nlocal competition;\ndiffering labor regulations;\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\ninadequate local infrastructure;\npotential incidences of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and\nvolatile geopolitical turmoil, including popular uprisings, regional conflicts, terrorism, and war.\nWe centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations: India and Malaysia. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\nFurther, even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks.\nEconomic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNationalistic economic policies and political trends such as opposition to globalization and free trade, sanctions or trade restrictions, including those on advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing, withdrawal from or re-negotiation of global trade agreements, tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests, the distancing or potential exit of countries from the European Union, and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs, reduced ability to hire employees, reduced access to supplies and materials, reduced demand or access to customers, and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically. Each of these factors may adversely affect our business.\nInternational trade disputes and increased tariffs between the United States and the United Kingdom, the European Union, Singapore, Malaysia and China, among other countries could substantially change our expectations and ability to operate in such jurisdictions as we have done historically. Many of our suppliers, vendors, customers, partners, and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in China. Their ability to supply materials to us, buy products or services from us, or otherwise work with us is affected by their ability to do business in China. If the U.S.s relationship with China results in additional trade disputes, trade protection measures, retaliatory actions, tariffs and increased barriers, policies that favor domestic industries, or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions, then our deployment of resources in jurisdictions affected by such measures could be misaligned and our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers, vendors, customers, partners, and other entities with whom we do business operate.\nVolatile geopolitical turmoil, including popular uprisings, regional conflicts, terrorism and war could result in market instability, which could negatively impact our business results.\nWe are a global company with international operations, and we sell our products and solutions in countries throughout the world. Regional conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in economic sanctions and the decision to discontinue our operations in Russia, the war between Israel and Hamas, and the risk of increased tensions between China and Taiwan, could limit or prohibit our ability to transfer certain technologies, to sell our products and solutions, and could result in additional closure of facilities in sanctioned countries. In addition, international conflict has resulted in increased pressure on the supply chain and could further result in increased energy costs, which could increase the cost of manufacturing, selling and delivering products and solutions; inflation, which has resulted in increases in the cost of manufacturing products and solutions, reduced customer purchasing power, increased price pressure, and reduced or cancelled orders; increased risk of cybersecurity attacks; and market instability, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated.\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technology-related spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, due to the uncertainties and volatile economic environment created by inflation, the potential for recession, increased geopolitical tensions, including regional conflict and war and continued supply chain challenges, the markets we serve may experience increased volatility and may not experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers' markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services. If our customers' markets decline, orders may decline, may be delayed or cancelled, and we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. In such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, R&D and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\nA decreased demand for our customers products or trade restrictions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business depends on our customers ability to manufacture, design, and sell their products in the marketplace. International trade disputes affecting our customers could adversely affect our business. Tariffs on imports to or from China could increase the cost of our customers components and raw materials, which could make our customers products and services more expensive and could reduce demand for our customers products. Protectionist and retaliatory trade measures by either China or the United States could limit our customers ability to sell their products and services and could reduce demand for our customers products. Our customers and other entities in our customer chain could decide to take actions in response to international trade disputes that we could not foresee. A decrease in demand or significant change in operations from our customers due to international trade disputes could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition to the above, our customers and suppliers have become subject to U.S. export restrictions and sanctions, such as being added to the U.S. Department of Commerces Lists of Parties of Concern and having U.S. export privileges denied or suspended. When a customer or supplier of ours becomes subject to such sanctions, we suspend our business with such customer or supplier. Because of the continued tense political and economic relationship between the U.S. and China and between the U.S. and Russia, new restrictions or sanctions have been imposed with little notice, which could leave us without an adequate alternative solution to compensate for our inability to continue to do business with such customer or supplier. Some of our suppliers and customers in the supply chain are working on unique solutions and products in the market, and it may be difficult if not impossible to replace them, especially with short notice. We cannot predict what impact future sanctions could have on our customers or suppliers, and therefore, our business. Any export restrictions or sanctions and any tariffs or other trade restriction imposed on our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our financial condition and business.\nFailure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition, rapid technological changes, and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete.\nWe generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new solutions, services and enhancements, our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\nproperly identify and assess customer needs;\ninnovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\nmanufacture and deliver our solutions in sufficient volumes and on time;\ndifferentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;\nprice our solutions competitively;\nanticipate our competitors' development of new solutions, services or technological innovations; and\ncontrol product quality in our manufacturing process.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate.\nOn a regular basis, we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in. We are currently devoting significant resources to new technologies in the communications, aerospace and defense, automotive, Internet of Things, and mobile industries. We are investing in R&D, developing relationships with customers and suppliers, and re-directing our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies. Our income could be harmed if we fail to expand our customer base, if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect, or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate. We provide solutions for the design, development, and manufacturing stages of our customers workflow. Our customers who currently use our solutions in one stage of their workflow may not use our solutions in other aspects of their manufacturing process.\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by volatile global economic conditions, geopolitical conflict, or the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our solutions and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. Making such estimations in an economic climate affected by inflation or potential recession, fluctuations in global currency, geopolitical tension and war is particularly difficult as increased volatility may impact seasonal trends making it more difficult to anticipate demand fluctuations. Supply chain fluctuations could impact our ability to purchase parts and components. Some parts require custom design and may not be readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to re-engineer our solution. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancellable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased. If demand for our solutions is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourced vendors could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure of our IT providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies and could impact our results of operations and stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions.\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand is lower than our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. During a general market upturn or an upturn in our business, if we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income, margin and operating results. By contrast, if, during an economic downturn, we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins and operating results.\nKey customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a global company, we have key customers all over the world, although no one customer makes up more than 10 percent of our revenue. Sales to those customers could be reduced or eliminated as a result of failure to respond to customer needs, reduced customer demand, increased sales to our competitors, inability to manufacture or ship products and solutions, supply chain constraints, trade restrictions, sanctions and embargoes. We have experienced forced reductions in sales and been prevented from selling large orders to certain key customers due to trade restrictions, which we have been able to mitigate with the addition of new customers and new business. If we have future reductions in sales or lose key customers, there is no guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the impact of such reductions or losses, which could negatively impact our income, operating results and financial condition.\nCertain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. These customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions. Large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times or fail to meet other obligations. While we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability, we may agree to some or all of these provisions to secure these orders and grow our business. Such actions expose us to significant additional risks, which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIndustry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere is potential for industry consolidation in our markets. As companies attempt to expand, strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the communications market, rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.\nAdditionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base, our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if, as a result of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms, which would decrease our revenue. Consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, internal reorganizations and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\nIn the normal course of business, we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. Additionally, we occasionally make changes to our internal structure to align business products, services and solutions with market demands and to obtain cost synergies and operational efficiencies. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. If market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions or reorganizations. Further, such third-party transactions often have post-closing arrangements, including, but not limited to, post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team, employees and business infrastructure into our existing operations without impacting the business operations of the newly acquired company. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances performance and expands the markets of the newly acquired company. The acquired company may not enhance the performance of our businesses or product lines such that we do not realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\nthe achievement of anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the acquired company;\nthe scalability of production, manufacturing and marketing of products of a newly acquired company to broader adjacent markets;\nthe ability to cohesively integrate operations, product definitions, price lists, contract terms and conditions, delivery, and technical support for products and solutions of a newly acquired company into our existing operations;\nthe compatibility of our infrastructure, operations, policies and organizations with those of the acquired company;\nthe retention of key employees and/or customers;\nthe management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas; and\nthe management of relationships with our strategic partners, suppliers, and customer base.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted. Additionally, we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments, and we may be required to incur impairment charges, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nAny inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance.\nOur ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance. Appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, limited due diligence, high valuations, difficulty obtaining business and intellectual property evaluations, other interested parties, negotiations of the definitive documentation, satisfaction of closing conditions, the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms, and availability of funding. The inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate, revenue, and financial performance.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nWe may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in R&D activities or need funds to make acquisitions. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience share dilution, which could affect the market price of our stock. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants.\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nOur incurrence of debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\nrequiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on outstanding debt;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nreducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; and\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry.\nOur current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens. If we breach\nany of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\nVolatility in currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial results.\nA substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in U.S. Dollars, although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies and could be impacted by significant currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our hedging programs are designed to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, within any given 12-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, including those caused by currency controls, which could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond a 12-month period, our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in the number of available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\nWe are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.\nOur effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape.\nOur effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because, among other things, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in tax laws, such as tax reform in the United States or changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developments (OECD) multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting and the taxation of the Digital Economy, could impact our effective tax rate.\nIf tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. Any changes to the positions we have taken could result in an impact to our financial statements. Our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax, accounting, and other laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act and The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S, regulations, principles, and interpretations in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we do business. With the existence of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests, it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates, or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours. Upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business, we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered, to the extent such incentives are offered.\nKeysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia, that will expire or require renewal at various times in the future. The tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions, we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided. We believe that we will satisfy such conditions, but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied. The Singapore tax incentive expires July 31, 2024, and the Malaysia incentive expires October 31,2025.\nOur taxes could increase if the existing Singapore or Malaysia incentives are revoked or are not renewed upon expiration. We cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist going forward. As a result, our effective\ntax rate could be higher than it would have been had we renewed the tax incentives and could harm our operating results after tax.\nGlobal health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had an impact on our supply chain and could have a material impact on our global operations, our customers and our vendors, which could adversely impact our business results and financial condition.\nGlobal health crises could have a material impact on our global operations, our employees, our customers and our vendors, which could adversely impact our business results and financial conditions. For example, the continued evolution of COVID-19 and its variants, as well as periodic spikes in infection rates, local outbreaks on our sites or supplier, customer or vendor sites, in spite of safety measures or vaccinations, could cause disruptions to our operations or those of our suppliers, customers or vendors. Pandemic conditions could lead to global supply chain challenges, which could adversely impact our ability to procure certain components and could impact our ability to manufacture products and cause delays in delivery of our solutions to our customers. As new variants of viruses appear, especially variants that are more easily spread, cause more serious outcomes, or are resistant to existing vaccines, new health orders and safety protocols could further impact our on-site operations and our ability to manufacture, ship or deliver products and solutions to customers.\nThese factors could materially and negatively impact our business results, operations, revenue, growth and overall financial condition.\nVolatile changes in weather conditions and effects of climate change could damage or destroy strategic facilities, including our headquarters, which could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nWe and our customers and suppliers are vulnerable to the increasing impact of climate change. Volatile changes in weather conditions, including extreme heat or cold, could increase the risk of wildfires, floods, blizzards, hurricanes and other weather-related disasters. Such extreme weather events can cause power outages and network disruptions that may result in disruption to operations and may impact our ability to manufacture and ship products, which may negatively impact revenue. Disasters created by extreme conditions could cause significant damage to or destruction of our facilities resulting in temporary or long-term closures of our facilities and operations and significant expense for repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed facilities. This could also result in loss or damage to employee homes, employees relocating to other parts of the country or being unwilling to relocate to strategic locations, housing shortages and loss of or inability to recruit key employees. This could result in adverse impact to the available workforce, damage to or destruction of inventory, inability to manufacture and deliver solutions, cancellation of orders, and breaches of customer contracts leading to reduced revenue.\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event, our operations could be significantly harmed.\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are vulnerable to catastrophic loss due to natural or man-made disasters. Several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations. For example, our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California and our production facilities in Japan are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\nOur commitment to net zero emissions in company operations by fiscal year 2040 will be subject to significant costs and regulations, which could impact business operations, processes, revenue, and reputation.\nIn May 2021, the company disclosed its commitment to achieving net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by the end of fiscal year 2040. The company plans to meet this commitment by reducing energy consumption through efficiency and conservation measures, investments in renewable energy and selective purchase of certified offsets for residual emissions. The company also committed in September 2021 to developing approved science-based targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In addition to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions defined by our net zero goal, the company has developed Scope 3 reduction and engagement targets across relevant categories as part of our commitment to science-based targets, which were approved by Science Based Target Initiative (\"SBTi\") on October 27, 2023. The\ndevelopment and implementation of goals and targets may require significant and expensive capital improvements, changes in product development, manufacturing processes and shipping methods. These changes may materially increase the cost to manufacture and ship products and solutions, result in price increases to customers, reduce product or solution performance, and create customer dissatisfaction, potentially adversely impacting our revenue and profitability.\nAchieving net zero emissions goals and targets may entail compliance with evolving laws and regulatory requirements, which may cause us to change or reconfigure facilities and operations to meet regulatory standards. If operations are out of compliance, we may be subject to civil or criminal actions, fines and penalties and be required to make significant changes to facilities and operations and temporarily or permanently shut down non-compliant operations, which could result in business disruption and significant unexpected expense, delays in or inability to develop, manufacture and ship products and solutions, customer dissatisfaction, loss of revenue and damage to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions through energy reduction measures or our investments in renewable energy are not successful, we may fail to achieve our net zero emission commitment by fiscal year 2040. If we are unable to achieve Scope 3 reduction and engagement targets, we may fail to achieve our commitment to science-based targets. Failing to achieve the companys net zero or science-based targets commitments could result in regulatory non-compliance, criminal or civil actions against us, assessment of fees and penalties, inability to develop, manufacture and ship products, customer dissatisfaction with our products and solutions, reduced revenue and profitability, shareholder lawsuits and damage to our reputation.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services.\nFrom time to time parties have claimed that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case-by-case basis. On January 1, 2022, Centripetal Networks filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Virginia, alleging that certain Keysight products infringe certain of Centripetals patents. In addition, in February 2022, Centripetal filed complaints in Germany alleging infringement of certain of Centripetals German patents, and in April 2022, Centripetal filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC) requesting that they investigate whether Keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the U.S. which are alleged to infringe Centripetal patents. Although we deny the allegations and are aggressively defending each case, the outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict.\nDisputes and litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property are costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations. Claims of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement (which may not be available under acceptable terms, or at all), require us to redesign certain of our solutions (which would be costly and time-consuming) and/or subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development, sale and importation of certain solutions or services. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all.\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.\nOur pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We have applied for trademarks related to our global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide. Any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand. Different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner, or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons. In addition, competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability\nto enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to infringe our intellectual property rights, capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others, which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\nIf we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our IT systems or our software products, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on several centralized IT systems to provide solutions and services, maintain financial records, retain sensitive data such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, suppliers, and business partners, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals.\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, employee training and routine updates and modifications. Despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge, and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.\nOur software products may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cybersecurity attackers, allowing them to introduce malicious code into our products to gain access to customer networks. Such attacks could lead to disruptions to our customers operations or processes, system downtime, financial loss, loss of their intellectual property, business information and proprietary data, or corruption of data, which could impact Keysights reputation, and result in loss of confidence in our products, loss of orders, and loss in revenue, which could materially impact our financial results. We proactively scan for vulnerabilities in our product lines. When vulnerabilities are discovered, we respond with a predefined Product Security Response Process to address the vulnerability, but we cannot eliminate the possibility of a successful cybersecurity attack or exploitation of undiscovered vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, instability, or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, implementation of new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software, catastrophes, or other unforeseen events. Such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets, such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. Further, such events could result in loss of revenue, loss of or reduction in purchase orders, inability to report financial information, litigation, regulatory fines and penalties, and other damage that could have a material impact on our business operations. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions, and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition.\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel, including personnel joining our company through acquisitions. The markets in which we operate are dynamic, and we may need to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures from time to time. We believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate. However, global labor shortages, inflationary pressure on wages, and increased global attrition have intensified competition for talent in most fields across the geographic areas in which we operate, and it may become more difficult to retain key employees. If we fail to retain key personnel and are unable to hire highly qualified replacements, we may not be able to meet key objectives, such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals, and maintain or expand our business.\nIf we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.\nWe and our customers are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including, but not limited to, export regulations, sanctions and embargoes, packaging, data privacy, product content, environmental, health and safety and labor. These regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time. We have been required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and to remedy violations of certain import/export\nregulations. Any future failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, high financial penalties, product recalls or impositions of fines, and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. If demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety inside and outside the United States, even where not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws. In spite of these efforts, no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with all applicable environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations and violations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, fines and penalties.\nWe have developed internal data handling policies and practices to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and data privacy regulations similar to GDPR in other jurisdictions. Our existing business strategy does not rely on aggregating or selling personally identifiable information, and as a general matter Keysight does not process personally identifiable information on behalf of our customers. We devote resources to keep up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business. Despite our efforts, no assurance can be given that we will be compliant with data privacy regulations. New laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. If we fail to comply with GDPR or other data privacy regulation, we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties, and may suffer damage to our reputation or brand, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties.\nBecause we have extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results.\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. On January 1, 2022, Centripetal Networks filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Virginia, alleging that certain Keysight products infringe certain of Centripetals patents. In addition, in February 2022, Centripetal filed complaints in Germany alleging infringement of certain of Centripetals German patents, and in April 2022, Centripetal filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC) requesting that they investigate whether Keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the U.S. and alleged to infringe Centripetal patents. Although we deny the allegations and are aggressively defending each case, the outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur internal controls may be determined to be ineffective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company, the value of our stock, and our access to capital.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, among other things. We devote significant resources and time to comply with such internal control over financial reporting requirements. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital, or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.\nFuture investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans.\nWe sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the U.S. plans, and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the United States. Because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition.\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\nSome of our properties have been the subject of remediation by HP Inc. (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of Agilent's separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent's separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation. As a result, HP will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In connection with the separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.\nOn December 17, 2021, Keysight and HP signed a restrictive covenant related to our Santa Rosa facility that prohibits certain uses of the property (such as running a daycare facility, hospital or school) and terminates HPs remediation obligation related to that facility. HPs remediation obligations relating to Keysights Colorado Springs facility are ongoing.\nOur current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the United States, even if the sites outside the United States are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur share price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the ticker symbol KEYS. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\nour ability to obtain third-party financing as needed;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\nthe operating and share price performance of other comparable companies;\ninvestor perception of our company;\nnatural or other disasters that investors believe may affect us;\noverall market fluctuations;\nresults from any material litigation or government investigations;\nchanges in laws or regulations affecting our business;\nnew or expanded trade restrictions;\neconomic conditions such as inflation or recession;\ngeopolitical conflicts; and\nother external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, when the market price of a companys shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock. The payment of any dividends in the future, and the timing and amount thereof, to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\nthe inability of our shareholders to call a special meeting;\nthe inability of our shareholders to act without a meeting of shareholders;\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\nthe division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, and this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;\na provision that shareholders may only remove directors with cause;\nthe ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 80 percent of our voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (relating to the number, term and removal of our directors, the filling of our board vacancies, the advance notice to be given for nominations for elections of directors, the calling of special meetings of shareholders, shareholder action by written consent, the ability of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, elimination of liability of directors to the extent permitted by Delaware law, exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and amendments of the certificate of incorporation) and certain provisions in our amended and restated bylaws (relating to the calling of special meetings of shareholders, the business that may be conducted or considered at annual or special meetings, the advance notice of shareholder business and nominations, shareholder action by written consent, the number, tenure, qualifications and removal of our directors, the filling of our board vacancies, director and officer indemnification and amendments of the bylaws).\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation (an \"interested stockholder\") shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (iii) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or Keysight's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nOur executive offices are located in the United States in an owned facility in Santa Rosa, California. We own or lease 134 operating facilities located throughout the world that handle manufacturing, research and development, administration, assembly, sales, quality, assurance testing, distribution, and packaging of our products. These facilities are primarily located in the following countries: United States, Malaysia, Japan, China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Spain, Korea, Singapore, and Romania.\nAs of October 31, 2023, we own or lease approximately 5.4 million square feet(a) of space worldwide, a summary of which is provided below:\nTotal square feet\n(in millions)\nOwned facilities 3.5\nLeased facilities 1.9\nTotal 5.4\nOccupancy of our facilities\nManufacturing plants, R&D facilities and warehouse and administrative facilities 5.2\nSales facilities 0.2\nTotal 5.4\n(a) Excludes 0.8 million square feet of vacated space, all of which is leased to third parties or is in restructuring.\nAll of these facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nOn August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we were assessed a penalty of $6.6 million to be paid over three years, $2.5 million of which was suspended and designated for remediation activities over three years, including employment of a special compliance officer. To date, we have paid $3.1 million of the penalty. The suspended portion of the penalty has been satisfied by amounts we have spent on qualifying compliance activities to date.\nOn January 1, 2022, Centripetal Networks filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Virginia, alleging that certain Keysight products infringe certain of Centripetals patents. In addition, in February 2022, Centripetal filed complaints in Germany alleging infringement of certain of Centripetals German patents, and in April 2022, Centripetal filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC) requesting that they investigate whether Keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the U.S. and which are alleged to infringe Centripetal patents. We deny the allegations and are aggressively defending each case.\nAlthough there are no matters pending that we currently believe are probable and reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial position, or results of operations or cash flows, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and is difficult to predict. An adverse outcome in any outstanding lawsuit or proceeding could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief. If adverse results are above managements expectations or are unforeseen, management may not have accrued for the liability, which could impact our results in a financial period.\nWe are also involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations, and other proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, commercial, and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") with the ticker symbol \"KEYS. As of December 12, 2023, there were 16,230 shareholders of record.\nStock Price Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative 5-year total stockholder return on our common stock relative to the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. The graph assumes that the value of the investment in our common stock and in each index on October 31, 2018 (including reinvestment of dividends) was $100 and tracks it each year thereafter on the last day of our fiscal year through October 31, 2023. The historical performance set forth below is not indicative of future stock price performance.\nWe have not paid any dividends, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. All decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends and stock repurchases are at the discretion of our board of directors and will be evaluated regularly in light of our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nThe information required by this item with respect to equity compensation plans will be included under the caption \"Equity Compensation Plans\" in our proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nIssuer Purchases Of Equity Securities\nThe table below summarizes information about the companys purchases, based on trade date, of its equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023.

Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors including, but not limited to, those risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview and Executive Summary\nKeysight Technologies, Inc. (\"we,\" \"us,\" \"Keysight\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator in the computing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers business success by helping them solve critical challenges in the development and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, \"accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,\" speaks to the value we provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test solutions that address the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market faster.\nOur fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\nMacroeconomic headwinds and challenging geopolitical environment\nOur global operations continue to be affected by many external headwinds, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, currency movements, increased geopolitical tensions, and trade restrictions. These headwinds are also negatively impacting our customers' operations and financial performance. As a result, demand has declined year-over-year as our customers are exercising caution in spending to manage financial results and adapt to post-pandemic industry dynamics. As we work through these near-term headwinds, we are exercising our financial playbook and the structural flexibility in our operating model to continue delivering strong financial results. We believe that Keysights technology leadership, differentiated first-to-market solutions portfolio, durable and resilient business model driven by the strength of the Keysight Leadership Model, continued customer engagement in new technology innovation spanning diverse applications across global markets, and our culture position us well to weather these macro and industry dynamics and deliver consistent long-term value to our customers.\nFor discussion of risks related to potential impacts of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical challenges on our operations, business results and financial condition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYears ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nOrders of $5,190 million for 2023 decreased 13 percent compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on order change for 2023 compared to 2022. Orders declined across all regions, including double-digit decline in Asia Pacific. Total orders for 2022 were $5,984 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 3 percentage points on order growth for 2022 compared to 2021. Orders grew across all regions, including double-digit growth in Asia Pacific.\nRevenue of $5,464 million for 2023 increased 1 percent compared to 2022. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on revenue growth for 2023 compared to 2022. A revenue increase in the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group was partially offset by a decline in the Communications Solutions Group. Revenue from the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group represented approximately 67 percent and 33 percent, respectively, of total revenue for 2023. Revenue of $5,420 million for 2022 increased 10 percent compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on revenue growth for 2022 compared to 2021. Revenue for both the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group grew compared to 2021. Revenue from the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group represented approximately 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total revenue for 2022.\nNet income was $1,057 million in 2023 compared to net income of $1,124 million and $894 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net income for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by higher income tax expense, R&D expense, and selling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by higher interest income, higher revenue, and favorable mix. The increase in net income for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher revenue volume, lower amortization of acquisition-related balances, and lower variable people-related costs, partially offset by higher material costs and higher selling, general and administrative, R&D, and income tax expenses.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, we generated operating cash flows of $1,408 million, $1,144 million and $1,322 million, respectively.\nOutlook\nOur first-to-market solutions strategy enables customers to develop new technologies and accelerate innovation and provides a platform for Keysight's long-term growth. Our customers are expected to continue to make R&D investments in certain next-generation technologies, including 5G, early 6G, high-speed data center, satellite networks and Artificial Intelligence-Machine Learning (\"AI-ML\") network modeling, new automotive mobility technologies, industrial internet of things (\"IoT\"), and defense modernization. We continue to engage actively with our customers, and closely monitor the current macro economic environment, including trade, tariffs, monetary and fiscal policies, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain challenges. Despite the near-term challenges, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth trends of our markets and our ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Exposure\nOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses, and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis. The result of hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations. We experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities. Our cash flow hedging program is designed to hedge short-term currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.\nResults from Operations - Years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nA summary of our results is as follows:\nYear Ended October 31, 2023 over 2022\n% Change 2022 over 2021\n% Change\n2023 2022 2021\nin millions, except margin data\nRevenue $ 5,464 $ 5,420 $ 4,941 1% 10%\nProducts $ 4,336 $ 4,386 $ 3,993 (1)% 10%\nPercentage of revenue\n79 % 81 % 81 % (2) ppts -\nServices and other $ 1,128 $ 1,034 $ 948 9% 9%\nPercentage of revenue\n21 % 19 % 19 % 2 ppts -\nGross margin 64.6 % 63.7 % 62.1 % 1 ppt 2 ppts\nProducts 64.2 % 63.3 % 62.2 % 1 ppt 1 ppt\nServices and other 66.3 % 64.9 % 61.9 % 1 ppt 3 ppts\nResearch and development $ 882 $ 841 $ 811 5% 4%\nPercentage of revenue\n16 % 16 % 16 % 1 ppt (1) ppt\nSelling, general and administrative $ 1,307 $ 1,283 $ 1,195 2% 7%\nPercentage of revenue\n24 % 24 % 24 % - -\nOther operating expense (income), net $ (15) $ (8) $ (17) 80% (53)%\nIncome from operations $ 1,358 $ 1,334 $ 1,080 2% 24%\nOperating margin 24.8 % 24.6 % 21.9 % - 3 ppts\nInterest income $ 102 $ 16 $ 3 518% 676%\nInterest expense $ (78) $ (79) $ (79) (1)% -\nOther income (expense), net $ (25) $ 14 $ 6 - 105%\nIncome before taxes $ 1,357 $ 1,285 $ 1,010 6% 27%\nProvision for income taxes $ 300 $ 161 $ 116 87% 39%\nNet income $ 1,057 $ 1,124 $ 894 (6)% 26%\nRevenue\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.

Gross margin increased 2 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by lower amortization of acquisition-related balances, price increases, higher revenue volume, and lower variable people-related costs, partially offset by higher material costs.\nExcess and obsolete inventory charges were $27 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nResearch and development expense increased 5 percent in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by continued investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leading-edge technologies, partially offset by lower variable people-related costs. Research and development expense increased 4 percent in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by investments in key growth opportunities in our end markets and leading-edge technologies, as well as incremental costs of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower variable people-related costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 2 percent in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher infrastructure-related, restructuring, and travel-related costs, partially offset by lower selling and variable people-related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7 percent in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by increased investment in sales resources, higher infrastructure-related, travel-related, and marketing costs, as well as incremental costs of acquired businesses, partially offset by lower variable people-related costs.\nOther operating expense (income) was income of $15 million, $8 million, and $17 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. During fiscal year 2022, other operating expense (income) includes asset impairment charges of $7 million related to the discontinuance of our Russia operations.\nOperating margin was flat in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by gross margin gains offset by higher R&D expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating margin increased 3 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by gross margin gains and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.\nInterest income for 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $102 million, $16 million, and $3 million, respectively, and primarily relates to interest earned on our cash balances. The increase in interest income in fiscal 2023 is primarily driven by an increase in interest rates and higher year-over-year cash balances. Interest expense for 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $78 million, $79 million, and $79 million, respectively, and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes.\nOther income (expense) for 2023, 2022, and 2021 was expense of $25 million, income of $14 million, and income of $6 million, respectively, and primarily includes net income related to our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans (interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service credits, and gains (losses) on settlements and curtailments), currency gains (losses), gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and the change in fair value of our equity investments. The increase in net other expense for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by losses on derivative instruments and higher amortization of net actuarial losses, partially offset by a net gain on our equity investments. The increase in net other income for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by $38 million lower amortization of net actuarial losses and a 2021 loss on a partial settlement of a non-U.S. pension plan, partially offset by a loss on our equity investments.\nOur headcount was approximately 14,900 at October 31, 2023, compared to approximately 15,000 at October 31, 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nProvision for income taxes $ 300 $ 161 $ 116\nEffective tax rate 22 % 13 % 11 %\nThe effective tax rate was 22 percent, 13 percent, and 11 percent for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The tax rate in 2023 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental expenditures, partially offset by the net impact from the proportion of worldwide earnings taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions and the U.S. tax imposed on those non-U.S. earnings. The tax rate in 2022 and 2021 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of worldwide earnings that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. tax imposed on earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThere was an increase in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 of 9 percent, primarily due to a 5 percent increase from the impact of the U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental expenditures. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\") became effective for Keysight on November 1, 2022, requiring that research and experimental expenditures be capitalized for U.S. tax purposes. The capitalized expenses are amortized over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside the U.S. The capitalization of research and experimental expenditures increases the U.S. tax on non-U.S. earnings as part of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax. There was an additional 2 percent increase in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 due to a decrease in 2022 taxes resulting from changes in tax reserves. The other changes in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 were not individually significant.\nThere was an increase in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 of 2 percent, primarily due to a 3 percent decrease in the 2021 effective tax rate from nonrecurring tax benefits, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease in 2022 effective tax rate from changes in tax reserves. The remaining 2 percent increase was comprised of various components that were not individually significant. The 2022 benefit from the change in tax reserves is primarily due to an audit settlement and an out-of-period adjustment. The 2021 significant nonrecurring tax benefits include the release of valuation allowance on Netherlands net operating losses in 2021 and a decrease due to the 2021 actual tax impact of acquired entity integration compared to the estimate at acquisition based on the finalization of the integration plan. The other changes in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 were not individually significant.\nKeysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia, that will expire at various times in the future. The tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. The Singapore tax incentive expires July 31, 2024, and the Malaysia tax incentive expires October 31, 2025. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of potential options on our effective tax rate. The impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by $95 million, $81 million, and $70 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in tax benefit from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of non-U.S. earnings, which increased the earnings taxed at incentive tax rates in 2023.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds requires significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe open tax years for the U.S. federal income tax return and most state income tax returns are from November 1, 2019 through the current tax year. For the majority of our non-U.S. entities, the open tax years are from November 1, 2017 through the current tax year. For certain non-U.S. entities, the tax years remain open, at most, back to the year 2008.\nThe company is being audited in Malaysia for fiscal year 2008. This tax year predates our separation from Agilent. However, pursuant to the agreement between Agilent and Keysight pertaining to tax matters, as finalized at the time of separation, for certain entities, including Malaysia, any historical tax liability is the responsibility of Keysight. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, Keysight paid income taxes and penalties of $68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights. The company believes there are strong technical defenses to the current assessment; the statute of limitations for the fiscal year 2008 in Malaysia was closed, and the income in question is exempt from tax in Malaysia. The company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all available recourses to resolve this issue favorably for the company. Our appeals to both the Special Commissioners of Income Tax and the High Court in Malaysia have been unsuccessful. The final hearing with the Court of Appeal took place on October 23, 2023. The decision is expected to be rendered on February 29, 2024. There are limited further legal options available after the conclusion is returned from the Court of Appeal.\nAt this time, management does not believe that the outcome of any future or currently ongoing examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with managements current expectations. If that were to occur, it could have an impact on our effective tax rate in the period in which such examinations are resolved.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various other countries globally. Changes in tax law, tax rates, or in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates may affect deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded and our future effective tax rate. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a fifteen percent minimum tax based on \"adjusted financial statement income,\" which is effective for Keysight beginning November 1, 2023. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reached agreement among various countries to implement a minimum fifteen percent tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two proposals. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. Some of these legislative changes could result in double taxation of our non-U.S. earnings, a reduction in the tax benefit received from our tax incentives, or other impacts to our effective tax rate and tax liabilities. Given the numerous proposed tax law changes and the uncertainty regarding such proposed legislative changes, the impact of Pillar Two cannot be determined at this time.\nWe do not recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to impact the GILTI tax expense in future years. We recognize the tax expense related to GILTI in each year in which the tax is incurred.\nSegment Overview\nWe have two reportable operating segments, the Communications Solutions Group and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. The profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, interest income, interest expense and other items.\nCommunications Solutions Group\nThe Communications Solutions Group (\"CSG\") serves customers spanning the global commercial communications and aerospace, defense, and government end markets. The groups solutions consist of electronic design and test software, instrumentation, systems, and related services.

Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on the year-over-year revenue change. Revenue decline in Asia Pacific and the Americas was partially offset by an increase in Europe. Revenue decline in the commercial communications end market was partially offset by growth in the aerospace, defense and government end market. The Communications Solutions Group revenue declined due to cautious customer spending across the communications ecosystem as those customers work through post-pandemic inventory dynamics and macroeconomic uncertainty. At the same time, our R&D engagements with customers remained strong and we continue to see investments in defense modernization and space and satellite communications, AI-ML and data center expansions, research in 5G and 6G, advanced quantum research, and new capabilities and devices as well as open radio access networks and release 17 features. Communications Solutions Group revenue for 2022 increased 8 percent compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on year-over-year revenue growth for 2022 compared to 2021. Revenue grew across all regions and in both the commercial communications and the aerospace, defense and government markets.\nRevenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 66 percent of total Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2023 and decreased 7 percent compared to 2022. Revenue declines in Asia Pacific and the Americas was partially offset by a slight increase in Europe. We saw demand for our wireline solutions, driven by AI-ML and data center expansion, and continue to see steady R&D investments in new capabilities and devices for 5G as well as Open RAN and release 17 features. Revenue from the commercial communications market represented approximately 69 percent of total Communications Solutions Group revenue in 2022 and increased 11 percent compared to 2021.

Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points on year-over-year revenue growth for 2023 compared to 2022. Revenue grew across all regions and markets. While we saw moderation of demand particularly in semiconductor and manufacturing applications in the second half of the year, the revenue increase was driven by continued investments in key long-term strategic initiatives, such as next-generation electric vehicle (\"EV\") and autonomous vehicle (\"AV\") mobility, digital health, industrial IoT, and advanced semiconductor technologies. Revenue for the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group in 2022 increased 14 percent compared to 2021.

Operating margin in 2022 was flat compared to 2021, primarily driven by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales, partially offset by gross margin declines.\nFinancial Condition\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity is affected by many factors, including normal ongoing operations of our business and fluctuations due to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Under certain circumstances, U.S. and local government regulations may limit our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs.\nOverview of Cash Flows\nOur key cash flow activities were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nin millions\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,408 $ 1,144 $ 1,322\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (288) $ (251) $ (353)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (687) $ (861) $ (671)\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs, the timing of payments for income taxes, variable pay, pension funding, and other items impact reported cash flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $264 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased $178 million in 2022 compared to 2021.\nNet income in 2023 decreased $67 million compared to 2022. Non-cash adjustments to net income were lower by $54 million, primarily due to a $36 million increase in unrealized gains on equity and other investments, a $14 million decrease in amortization, a $10 million increase in deferred tax benefit, and a $7 million decrease in other non-cash adjustments, which was primarily driven by prior year one-time asset impairment charges related to the discontinuance of our Russia operations, partially offset by a $10 million increase in share-based compensation, and a $3 million increase in depreciation expense.\nNet income in 2022 increased $230 million compared to 2021. Non-cash adjustments to net income were higher by $32 million, primarily due to a $60 million decrease in deferred tax benefits, a $31 million unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, a $22 million increase in share-based compensation expense and a $7 million asset impairment charge, partially offset by a $70 million decrease in amortization, a $16 million lower pension settlement loss and a $2 million decrease from other miscellaneous non-cash activities.\nThe aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable used net cash of $196 million during 2023, compared to net cash used of $273 million in 2022 and $112 million in 2021. The decrease in aggregate net cash used in 2023 is primarily driven by higher collections, net of payments, partially offset by an increase in inventory driven by an incremental stock build-up to secure supply to support order fulfillment along with an increase in demo inventory. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable depends on the cash conversion cycle, which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases, as well as collections and payments in a period.\nNet cash used for retirement and post-retirement benefits was $8 million in 2023 compared to net cash used of $19 million in 2022 and net cash provided of $7 million in 2021. See Note 12, \"Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans,\" for additional information.\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, we terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements resulting in proceeds of $107 million. See Note 9, \"Derivatives,\" for additional information.\nThe aggregate other movements in assets and liabilities provided net cash of $78 million during 2023, compared to net cash used of $112 million in 2022 and net cash provided of $141 million in 2021. The difference between 2023 and 2022 cash flows is primarily due to lower prepaid inventory deposits driven by easing of supply chain constraints and other lower prepaid expenses, unrealized loss on foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments (see Note 9, \"Derivatives\"), and changes in other assets and liabilities, offset by higher income tax payments, net of\naccruals, higher variable compensation and other payroll-related payments, net of accruals, and changes in deferred revenue. The difference between 2022 and 2021 cash flows is primarily due to higher prepaid inventory deposits driven by supply chain constraints, higher income tax payments, net of accruals, higher variable compensation and other payroll-related payments, net of accruals, higher prepaid expenses, and changes in deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash changes in investing activities primarily relates to investments in property, plant and equipment and acquisitions of businesses to support our growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $37 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and decreased by $102 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Investments in property, plant and equipment increased $11 million compared to 2022 and increased $11 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in capital spending in 2023 was driven by capital investments to increase the resiliency of our supply chains.\nIn 2023, we used $288 million for investing activities, including $196 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment; $85 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisition activities; and $7 million for purchase of a cost-method investment.\nIn 2022, we used $251 million for investing activities, including $185 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment; $33 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisition activities; and $33 million for investments, including $30 million for purchase of an equity investment.\nIn 2021, we used $353 million for investing activities, including $174 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment; $102 million, net of $11 million of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Sanjole Inc.; and $76 million, net of cash acquired, for other acquisition activities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash changes in financing activities primarily relate to proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, and treasury stock repurchases.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $174 million in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased by $190 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decline in net cash used in 2023 was primarily due to lower treasury stock repurchases.\nIn 2023, we used $687 million for financing activities, including $702 million for treasury stock repurchases and $49 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $67 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.\nIn 2022, we used $861 million for financing activities, including $849 million for treasury stock repurchases and $74 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $63 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.\nIn 2021, we used $671 million for financing activities, including $673 million for treasury stock repurchases and $53 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $59 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.\nTreasury stock repurchases\nOn March 6, 2023, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1,500 million of the companys common stock, replacing the previously approved November 2021 program authorizing the purchase of up to $1,200 million of the companys common stock, of which $225 million remained. The stock repurchase program may be commenced, suspended, or discontinued at any time at the companys discretion and does not have an expiration date. See \"Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" under Part II Item 2 for additional information.\nDebt\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\nin millions\nTotal debt (par value) $ 1,800 $ 1,800\nRevolving credit facility $ 750 $ 750\nOn July 30, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility), which provided a $750 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 30, 2026 with an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 1 percent along with a facility fee of 0.125 percent per annum. On February 17, 2023, we entered into the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility to change the annual interest rate from LIBOR + 1 percent to SOFR + 1.1 percent. The Revolving Credit Facility permits the company, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions to request to increase the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $250 million in the aggregate. We may use amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended October 31, 2023. See Note 11, \"Debt\" for additional information.\nCash and cash requirements\nCash\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\nin millions\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 2,488 $ 2,057\nU.S. $ 362 $ 371\nNon-U.S. $ 2,126 $ 1,686\nOur cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments in institutional money market funds, short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of three months or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and money market fund asset managers with whom we invest our funds. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs. In addition, a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and short-term working capital lines of credit.\nCash requirements\nWe have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. We generally intend to use available cash and funds generated from our operations to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, we may also borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn November 3, 2023, we acquired 50.6% of the share capital of ESI Group SA (\"ESI Group\") for approximately $512 million, using existing cash. On November 7, 2023, we filed a tender offer to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of ESI Group at a price per share of 155 euros, to be primarily funded by approximately $457 million placed in an escrow account. Should the tender offer result in ESI Group's remaining minority shareholders holding no more than 10 percent of ESI Group's share capital and voting rights, then Keysight intends to proceed with a mandatory squeeze-out of all remaining ESI Group shares at the end of the tender offer period and to delist ESI Group from Euronext Paris.\nThe following table summarizes our short and long-term cash requirements as of October 31, 2023:\nTotal Due within one\nyear Due later than one\nyear\nin millions\nSenior notes obligations $ 1,800 $ 600 $ 1,200\nInterest payments on senior notes 229 74 155\nOperating lease commitments 262 46 216\nCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 544 518 26\nOther purchase commitments 75 34 41\nOther liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 1,692 1,100 592\nTotal $ 4,602 $ 2,372 $ 2,230\nSenior notes obligations and interest payments on senior notes. We have contractual obligations for principal and interest payments on our senior notes. See Note 11, \"Debt\" for additional information.\nOperating lease commitments. Commitments under operating leases primarily relates to leasehold properties. See Note 10, \"Leases,\" for additional information.\nCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. See Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" As of October 31, 2023, we had non-cancellable purchase commitments that aggregated $467 million, of which the majority is for less than one year.\nOther purchase commitments. Other purchase commitments primarily relate to software as a service and other professional services contracts.\nWe also have long-term power purchase agreements to purchase power at predominantly variable prices. These agreements are expected to support our power consumption needs with more favorable pricing and reliability than our previous supply agreements. See Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nOther liabilities. Other liabilities primarily includes contract liabilities, net pension and post-retirement benefit obligations, employee compensation and benefits, net tax liabilities, standard warranties and other accrued liabilities. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on managements estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based on historical experience.\nOf the tax liabilities included in the above table, $54 million relates to a U.S. transition tax liability and $169 million for uncertain tax positions. The remaining U.S. transition tax liability, which Keysight originally elected to pay over 8 years, is payable over the next 3 years and relates to a one-time U.S. tax on those earnings that had not been previously repatriated to the U.S. With regard to the $169 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with managements current expectations. See Note 5 Income Taxes for additional information.\nIn addition to the obligations noted above, as of October 31, 2023, we had $41 million of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that were issued by various lenders.\nFor the next twelve months, we do not expect to contribute to our U.S. defined benefit plan and U.S. post-retirement benefit plan, and we expect to contribute $12 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans. The ultimate amounts we may contribute depend on, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plans funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates, and other factors. See Note 12,\n\"Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.\"\nAdditionally, we expect capital spending to be approximately $150 million in 2024, compared to $196 million in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower investments in capacity expansion.\nAs of October 31, 2023, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future both globally and domestically.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of October 31, 2023. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective, or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuations of goodwill and other intangible assets, warranty, loss contingencies, restructuring, and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We primarily generate revenue from the sale of products (hardware and/or software), services, or a combination thereof. We enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price (SSP). We recognize revenue following a five-step model.\n1.Identify the contract with a customer: Generally, we consider customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales or other purchase agreements, to be the customer contract. All of the following criteria must be met before we consider an agreement to qualify as a contract with a customer under the revenue standard: (i) it must be approved by all parties; (ii) each partys rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred can be identified; (iii) the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified; (iv) the agreement has commercial substance; and, (v) the customer has the ability and intent to pay and collection of substantially all of the consideration is probable. We exercise reasonable judgment to determine the customers ability and intent to pay, which is based upon various factors including the customers historical payment experience or credit and financial information and credit risk management measures that we implement.\n2.Identify the performance obligations in the contract: We assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the various performance obligations in each contract. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and, (ii) our promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable or distinct from other promises in the contract.\n3.Determine the transaction price: Transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services. Our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price including rebates, rights of return, trade-in credits, and discounts. Variable consideration is generally accounted for at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information.\n4.Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract: If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations with a combination of distinct products and services, maintenance and support, professional services and/or training. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction value to each distinct performance obligation based on relative SSP. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately under similar circumstances to similar customers. Since most contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we use information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate SSP when we dont have standalone transactions.\n5.Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied: Revenue is recognized at the point in time control is transferred to the customer. For hardware sales, transfer of control to the customer typically occurs at the point the product is shipped or delivered to the customers designated location. For software license sales transfer of control to the customer typically occurs upon shipment, electronic delivery, or when the software is available for download by the customer. For sales of implementation service and custom solutions or in instances where products are sold along with essential installation services, transfer of control occurs and revenue is typically recognized upon customer acceptance. For fixed-price support and extended warranty contracts, or certain software arrangements that provide customers with a right to access over a discrete period, control is deemed to transfer over time and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term due to the stand-ready nature of the performance obligation. Revenue from hardware repairs and calibration services outside of an extended warranty or support contract is recognized at the time of completion of the related service. For other professional services or time-based labor contracts, revenue is recognized as we perform the services and the customers receive and/or consume the benefits.\nInventory valuation. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing and sales to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\nShare-based compensation. We account for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Awards granted under the Keysight Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance (\"LTP\") Program are based on a variety of targets, such as total shareholder return (\"TSR\") or financial metrics such as operating margin. The awards based on TSR were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of Keysights common stock on the date of grant. The compensation cost for financial metrics-based performance awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For additional information on valuation assumptions, see Note 4, Share-Based Compensation. The estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of Keysights common stock on the date of grant. We did not grant any option awards in 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of October 31, based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Keysight based on the terms of the plans. To estimate the present value of these future payments, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The discount rate is a critical assumption. Other important assumptions include expected long-term return on plan assets, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. See Note 12, \"Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.\"\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date, which is October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates. In addition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost: service cost and interest cost. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $6 million on U.S. net periodic benefit cost and $5 million on non-U.S. net periodic benefit cost. Lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense.\nThe company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. For most non-U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and\nexpected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $8 million on U.S. net periodic benefit cost and $8 million on non-U.S. net periodic benefit cost.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. At the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\nCompanies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.\nThe quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the results derived using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted accordingly. The income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method, which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value.\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and backlog and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 12 years. We review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. No impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") intangible assets. No material impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded in 2021. We had no IPR&D intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWarranty. Keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. Warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized.\nWe also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. Revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.\nLoss Contingencies. As discussed in Note 13, \"Supplemental Financial Information\" and Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the consolidated financial statements, we are, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). We recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation.\nRestructuring. The main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.\nAccounting for income taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax benefits, credits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. At October 31, 2023, the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to net operating losses in Luxembourg and the U.K., capital losses and net operating losses in the U.K., and California research credits. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, \"Overview, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAt various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. For further discussion of derivative financial instruments, see Note 9, \"Derivatives.\"\nCurrency exchange rate risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales and expense forecasts on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.\nOur operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenue, third-party vendor payments, and inter-company payments. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market, we enter into foreign exchange contracts as described above to substantially mitigate our currency risk. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, approximately 75 percent, 77 percent, and 77 percent, respectively, of our revenues were generated in U.S. dollars.\nThe unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, had an immaterial impact on our revenue in the year ended October 31, 2023. We calculate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each fiscal quarter of the current fiscal year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We also performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of October 31, 2023, and 2022, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nInterest rate risk\nA change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the companys fixed-rate long-term debt but not the companys earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.\nAs of October 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the companys fixed-rate debt by approximately $30 million. However, since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, nor do the investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the companys fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the companys results of operations or stockholders equity. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements Page\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 238)\nConsolidated Statement of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023\nConsolidated Statement of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Keysight Technologies, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keysight Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nU.S. Defined Benefit Plan Obligations\nAs described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has defined benefit plan obligations of $634 million for its U.S. plans as of October 31, 2023. Management remeasures the defined benefit plan obligations at least annually based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Keysight based on the terms of the plans. Management estimates the present value of the future payments using actuarial concepts and assumptions. The critical assumption used by management to estimate the defined benefit plan obligations is the discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Companys U.S. defined benefit plan obligations is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the present value of the defined benefit plan obligations; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the significant assumption related to the discount rate used in determining the present value of the defined benefit plan obligations; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the determination of the present value of the defined benefit plan obligations, including controls over the Companys methods, significant assumptions, and data. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimate and the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial concepts used to estimate the present value of the defined benefit plan obligations, (ii) developing an independent range of the U.S. discount rate and (iii) comparing management's selected discount rate to the independently developed ranges to evaluate the reasonableness of managements discount rate assumption. Developing the independent estimate involved developing a range of independent discount rates for each U.S. benefit plan based on publicly available market data for high quality corporate bonds.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nDecember 15, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2013.\nKEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue:\nProducts $ 4,336 $ 4,386 $ 3,993\nServices and other 1,128 1,034 948\nTotal revenue 5,464 5,420 4,941\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of products 1,552 1,607 1,511\nCost of services and other 380 363 361\nTotal costs 1,932 1,970 1,872\nResearch and development 882 841 811\nSelling, general and administrative 1,307 1,283 1,195\nOther operating expense (income), net (15) (8) (17)\nTotal costs and expenses 4,106 4,086 3,861\nIncome from operations 1,358 1,334 1,080\nInterest income 102 16 3\nInterest expense (78) (79) (79)\nOther income (expense), net (25) 14 6\nIncome before taxes 1,357 1,285 1,010\nProvision for income taxes 300 161 116\nNet income $ 1,057 $ 1,124 $ 894\nNet income per share:\nBasic $ 5.95 $ 6.23 $ 4.84\nDiluted $ 5.91 $ 6.18 $ 4.78\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share:\nBasic 178 180 185\nDiluted 179 182 187\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nKEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 1,057 $ 1,124 $ 894\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nGains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax benefit (expense) of $4, $(19) and $(6)\n(15) 73 26\nAmounts reclassified into earnings related to derivative instruments, net of tax benefit (expense) of $1, zero and zero\n(6) (3) (2)\nForeign currency translation, net of tax benefit (expense) of zero\n18 (165) (10)\nNet defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs:\nChange in net actuarial gain (loss), net of tax benefit (expense) of $10, zero and $(55)\n(9) 83 144\nChange in net prior service credit, net of tax benefit of zero, zero and zero\n- - (1)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (12) (12) 157\nTotal comprehensive income $ 1,045 $ 1,112 $ 1,051\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nKEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\n(in millions, except par value and share data)\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,472 $ 2,042\nAccounts receivable, net 900 905\nInventory 985 858\nOther current assets 452 429\nTotal current assets 4,809 4,234\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 761 690\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 226 220\nGoodwill 1,640 1,582\nOther intangible assets, net 155 189\nLong-term investments 81 62\nLong-term deferred tax assets 671 667\nOther assets 340 454\nTotal assets $ 8,683 $ 8,098\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 599 $ -\nAccounts payable 286 348\nEmployee compensation and benefits 304 333\nDeferred revenue 541 495\nIncome and other taxes payable 90 96\nOperating lease liabilities 40 39\nOther accrued liabilities 189 96\nTotal current liabilities 2,049 1,407\nLong-term debt 1,195 1,793\nRetirement and post-retirement benefits 64 58\nLong-term deferred revenue 216 197\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 192 186\nOther long-term liabilities 313 296\nTotal liabilities 4,029 3,937\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 14)\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock;

OVERVIEW, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOverview. Keysight Technologies, Inc. (\"we,\" \"us,\" \"Keysight\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator in the computing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers business success by helping them solve critical challenges in the development and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, \"accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,\" speaks to the value we provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test solutions that address the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market faster.\nBasis of Presentation. We have prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\nManagement is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and has full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of operations, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and statement of equity.\nPrinciples of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of October 31, 2023. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, warranty, loss contingencies, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.\nReclassifications. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, to align the presentation of revenue with the manner in which management reviews such information, the presentation of \"products\" and \"services and other\" revenue and \"costs and expenses\" in the consolidated statement of operations were reclassified to move revenue and costs and expenses primarily related to bundled licenses and technical support services from \"products\" to \"services and other.\" This resulted in reclassification of $88 million and $57 million, respectively, from \"products\" revenue to \"services and other\" revenue for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, and $10 million and $11 million, respectively, from \"cost of products\" to \"cost of services and other\" for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 to conform to the current presentation. This change had no impact on reported total revenue, income from operations and net income in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRevenue recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We primarily generate revenue from the sale of products (hardware and/or software), services, or a combination thereof. We enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\"). Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nProduct revenues are generated predominantly from the sale of various types of design and test software and hardware. Products consist of standalone software and hardware generally installed with software applications that are licensed on a perpetual and term basis. Our hardware products generally do not have any substantive acceptance terms that would otherwise preclude the transfer of control. Performance obligations related to our software licenses, including the license portion of our software subscriptions, grant the customer the right to use our software primarily via electronic delivery.\nService revenues consist of repair and calibration services, extended warranties, technical support for hardware and software, when-and-if available software updates and upgrades, and professional services, including installation and implementation, consulting, and training. Services include both hardware and software services. Repair and calibration services for hardware products are sold both as per-incident customer services and as customer agreements to provide such services over the contractual period. Extended warranties are optional to the customer and provide warranty on hardware products for additional years beyond the standard one-year warranty. Technical support for software and when-and-if available software updates and upgrades are sold either together with our software licenses and software subscriptions, or separately as part of our customer support programs. These are considered stand-ready performance obligations where customers benefit from the services evenly throughout the license or service period. These performance obligations provide the customer access evenly over the contract period. Our professional services may be sold on a time and material basis (e.g., consulting) or on a fixed-fee basis (e.g., non-recurring engineering).\nWe also generate revenues from a combination of products and services (\"custom solutions\"), including combinations of hardware, software, software subscriptions, installation, professional services, and other support services. Custom solutions provide the customer with a combination of hardware, software and professional services to meet customers' unique specifications and are accounted for as one performance obligation.\nFor our contracts with customers, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. Our standard payment terms are net 30 to 90 days, and we generally do not offer extended payment terms beyond one year. Our contracts typically contain various forms of variable consideration, including trade discounts, trade-in credits, rebates, and rights of return. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on relative SSP. SSPs for a majority of our products and services are estimated based on our established pricing practices and maximize the use of observable inputs. An observable input is the price of the good or service when it is sold as a separate item in a similar circumstance and to a similar customer as in the contract for which SSPs are being determined. We have elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by Keysight from a customer (e.g., sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes). We have also elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations.\nOur typical performance obligations include the following:\nPerformance obligation When performance obligation is typically satisfied When payment is typically due How standalone selling price is typically determined\nProduct Revenues\nHardware When customer obtains control of the product, typically at delivery (point in time) Within 30-90 days of shipment Estimated based on established pricing practices or observable based on standalone sales for certain hardware products\nSoftware licenses Primarily upon electronic delivery of the software, and the applicable license period has begun (point in time) Within 30-90 days of the beginning of license period Estimated based on established pricing practices or observable based on standalone sales for certain software products\nSoftware subscriptions\nRatably over the subscription period (over time) Within 30-90 days of the beginning of subscription period Estimated based on established pricing practices\nService Revenues\nCalibration contracts Ratably over the service contract period (over time) Within 30-90 days of the beginning of service contract period Estimated based on established pricing practices\nRepair and calibration (per- incident)\nAs services are performed (point in time)\nWithin 30-90 days of invoicing for services rendered Estimated based on established pricing practices\nExtended hardware warranty Ratably over the warranty period (over time) Within 30-90 days of invoicing Estimated based on established pricing practices or observable based on standalone sales of certain hardware warranty contracts\nTechnical support and when-and-if-available software updates Ratably over the license service contract period (over time) Within 30-90 days of the beginning of license or service contract period Estimated based on established pricing practices or observable based on standalone sales for certain support contracts\nProfessional services As services are performed based on measures of progress (over time) or at a point in time Within 30-90 days of invoicing for services rendered Estimated based on established pricing practices\nCustom Solutions\nCustom solutions (milestone-based; percentage-of-completion) As milestones are achieved based on transfer of control to customer (over time) Within 30-90 days of milestone achievement Transaction price, as pricing is custom and can vary significantly from contract to contract\nCustom solutions (point in time) When customer obtains control of the solution, typically at delivery or customer acceptance, as defined by the contract (point in time) Within 30-90 days of delivery of solution Transaction price, as pricing is custom and can vary significantly from contract to contract\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. As most of our products and services are not sold on a standalone basis, we typically estimate the SSP. In doing so, we consider our internal price list for each product and service, which reflects our desired profitability, based on an expected level of sales, and adjust for factors such as competition, customer relationship, discount provided in the contract, geographic location, and the products and services purchased in the arrangement. We use a range based on actual historical sales to determine whether the calculated SSP for a product or service is a fair representation of the SSP.\nFor capitalized contract costs, we use judgment in determining the capitalized amount and amortization period.\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, and we may provide other credits, discounts, or incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information. Returns, credits, and discounts are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of the cumulative amount of revenue recognized will not occur once the variability is subsequently resolved.\nShipping and handling costs. Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in revenue, and the associated expense is recorded in cost of products for all periods presented.\nDeferred revenue. We recognize contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, which represents the amount of service and software revenue deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. In addition, it includes the amount allocated to undelivered performance obligations.\nAccounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Such accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for credit losses, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for credit losses was approximately $5 million and $4 million, respectively, as of October 31, 2023 and 2022. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nShare-based compensation. We account for share-based awards made to our employees and directors, including restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), employee stock purchases made under Keysight's employee stock purchase plan under Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"ESPP\"), employee stock option awards, and performance share awards under Keysight Technologies, Inc. Long-Term Performance (\"the LTP\") Program, using the estimated grant date fair value method of accounting. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur and are reductions from share-based compensation expense. We recorded compensation expense for all share-based awards of $136 million in 2023, $126 million in 2022 and $104 million in 2021.\nInventory. Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not in excess of market value. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates about future demand and actual usage. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales unit forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory.\nWarranty. Keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. Warranties for products sold through distribution channels are primarily for three years. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized. See Note 13, \"Supplemental Financial Information.\"\nWe also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. Revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.\nLoss contingencies. We accrue for probable losses from contingencies, including legal settlement costs, on an undiscounted basis when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable. We periodically evaluate available information, both internal and external, relative to such contingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary.\nTaxes on income. Income tax expense is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between asset and liability amounts that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate due to new information. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of September 30, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. The impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with an impairment charge recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit. We determine fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded comparable companies. The selections of comparable businesses are based on the markets in which our reporting units operate, giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography and diversity of products and services. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business.\nAs defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. See Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for additional information about our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and acquired backlog and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 12 years. We review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. No impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") intangible assets. No material impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were recorded in 2021. We had no IPR&D intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $24 million in 2023, $27 million in 2022 and $21 million in 2021.\nResearch and development. Costs related to the research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.\nGovernment assistance. Keysight receives various forms of government assistance, primarily through grants related to the development of new products. We record proceeds from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the relevant conditions of the grant agreement and we are confident the grant funds will be received. Grants in recognition of specific expenses are recognized in the same period as an offset to those related expenses.\nGrants received from new or existing arrangements during fiscal year 2023 were $4 million and recorded as an offset to expenses in research and development in the consolidated statement of operations. Grant proceeds receivable as of October\n31, 2023 were $5 million and recorded in accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheet. Grant proceeds received prior to Keysight meeting the conditions of the grant are recorded in \"other accrued liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheet, and grant income is recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. These amounts were not material for fiscal year 2023.\nInvestments. Investments with readily determinable fair values and trading securities are reported at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. There was no impairment recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNet income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding the dilutive effect of share-based awards. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense, and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested RSUs. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original maturity or remaining maturity at the time of purchase is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\nAs of October 31, 2023, approximately $2.1 billion of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments in institutional money market funds, short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of three months or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions in which we invest our funds. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs. In addition, a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and short-term working capital lines of credit.\nWe classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or less.\nFair value of financial instruments. The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is determined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the equity method or a measurement alternative, the carrying value approximates estimated fair value. The fair value of our debt, calculated from quoted prices that are Level 1 inputs under the accounting guidance fair value hierarchy, is approximately $1,679 million as of October 31, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is estimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies, are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. See also Note 8, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" for additional information on the fair value of financial instruments.\nConcentration of credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentration of credit risk include money market fund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. These investments are categorized as cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments. In addition, we have credit risk from derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities and accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.\nCredit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.\nCredit risk is mitigated through collateral, such as letters of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of accounts receivable as of October 31, 2023 or 2022.\nDerivative instruments. We are exposed to global foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts and primarily use forward contracts to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions (cash flow exposure) and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary (balance sheet exposure). For cash flow hedges, contracts are designed at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of the hedge. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Our foreign exchange cash flow hedging contracts have maturities based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instruments are recognized in accumulated comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecast transaction occurs or it becomes probable the forecast transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in the balance sheet. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities.\nProperty, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. We use the straight-line method to depreciate assets. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives, which is generally over five years to forty years, or the remaining term of the lease; and machinery and equipment is generally depreciated over three years to ten years.\nLeases. We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and operating lease liabilities (current and non-current) on our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, other accrued liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Our finance lease and lessor arrangements are immaterial.\nROU assets and lease obligations are recognized based on their present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment to discount lease obligations. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. We initially measure payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement. Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. See Note 10, \"Leases,\" for additional information.\nImpairment of long-lived assets. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.\nRestructuring costs. The main component of our existing restructuring plans is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.\nEmployee compensation and benefits. Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are reported within employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheet. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $113 million and $109 million as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nForeign currency translation. We translate and remeasure balance sheet and statement of operations items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into\nU.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates that approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.\nFor those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are generally remeasured at monthly exchange rates that approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included in net income. Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency asset and liability remeasurement transactions are reported in other income (expense) and were a $49 million loss in 2023, a $1 million loss in 2022 and a $3 million gain in 2021. Net foreign currency losses of $49 million in 2023 include unrealized losses of $45 million on outstanding forward exchange contracts associated with the acquisition of ESI Group S.A. See Note 9, \"Derivatives.\"\nRetirement plans and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of October 31, based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Keysight based on the terms of the plans. To estimate the present value of these future payments, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of GAAP. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. See Note 12, \"Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.\"\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance. In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that requires annual disclosures of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contributions accounting model by analogy. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. We adopted this guidance effective November 1, 2022.\nOther amendments to GAAP that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n2. ACQUISITIONS\n2023 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, we acquired Cliosoft, Inc. (\"Cliosoft\") for $85 million, net of $15 million cash acquired. Cliosoft's data and intellectual property management tools enhance our portfolio of electronic design automation solutions. Based on the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we recognized additions to goodwill and other intangible assets of $56 million and $56 million, respectively. The identified intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology of $41 million, customer relationships of $13 million and backlog of $2 million. The estimated useful lives of developed technology range between 6 to 7 years, customer relationships is 6 years, and backlog is 3 years. Goodwill for the acquisition was assigned to the Communications Solutions Group (\"CSG\") and Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (\"EISG\") operating segments using the relative fair value allocation approach.\n2022 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2022, we used $33 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisition activity and recognized goodwill and other intangible assets of $20 million and $23 million, respectively, based on the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Of the $20 million goodwill, $9 million was assigned to CSG and $11 million was assigned to EISG.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)\nPro forma results of operations for 2023 and 2022 acquisitions have not been presented because the effects of the acquisitions were not material to the companys financial results.\n3. REVENUE\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by geographic region, end market, and timing of revenue recognition, as we believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Disaggregated revenue is presented for each of our reportable segments, Communications Solutions Group (\"CSG\") and Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (\"EISG\").\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCSG EISG Total CSG EISG Total CSG EISG Total\n(in millions)\nRegion\nAmericas $ 1,798 $ 407 $ 2,205 $ 1,824 $ 379 $ 2,203 $ 1,697 $ 299 $ 1,996\nEurope 536 420 956 523 359 882 500 295 795\nAsia Pacific 1,351 952 2,303 1,456 879 2,335 1,326 824 2,150\nTotal revenue $ 3,685 $ 1,779 $ 5,464 $ 3,803 $ 1,617 $ 5,420 $ 3,523 $ 1,418 $ 4,941\nEnd Market\nAerospace, Defense & Government $ 1,250 $ - $ 1,250 $ 1,171 $ - $ 1,171 $ 1,142 $ - $ 1,142\nCommercial Communications 2,435 - 2,435 2,632 - 2,632 2,381 - 2,381\nElectronic Industrial - 1,779 1,779 - 1,617 1,617 - 1,418 1,418\nTotal revenue $ 3,685 $ 1,779 $ 5,464 $ 3,803 $ 1,617 $ 5,420 $ 3,523 $ 1,418 $ 4,941\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nRevenue recognized at a point in time $ 3,012 $ 1,515 $ 4,527 $ 3,166 $ 1,393 $ 4,559 $ 2,936 $ 1,233 $ 4,169\nRevenue recognized over time 673 264 937 637 224 861 587 185 772\nTotal revenue $ 3,685 $ 1,779 $ 5,464 $ 3,803 $ 1,617 $ 5,420 $ 3,523 $ 1,418 $ 4,941\nOur point-in-time revenues are generated predominantly from the sale of various types of design and test software and hardware, and per-incident repair and calibration services. Perpetual software and the portion of term software subscription revenue in this category represents revenue recognized up front upon transfer of control at the time of electronic delivery. Revenue on per-incident repair and calibration services is recognized when services are performed. Over-time revenues are generated predominantly from the repair and calibration contracts, extended warranties, technical support for hardware and software, certain software subscription and Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") product offerings, and professional services. Technical support for software and when-and-if available software updates and upgrades are sold either together with our software licenses and software subscriptions, including SaaS, or separately as part of our customer support programs.\nAdditionally, we provide custom solutions that include combinations of hardware, software, software subscriptions, installation, professional services, and other support services, and revenue may be recognized either up front on delivery or over time depending upon the terms of the contract.\nContract Balances\nContract assets\nContract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts are primarily related to solutions and support arrangements when transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. The contract assets balances were $58 million and $88 million as of October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in \"accounts receivables, net\" and \"other assets\" in our consolidated balance sheet.\nContract costs\nWe capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We have determined that certain employee and third-party representative commission programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit. Capitalized contract costs were $43 million and $38 million as of October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The amortization expense associated with these capitalized costs was $62 million, $84 million and $77 million for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nContract liabilities\nOur contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue that arises when we receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. Contract liabilities are primarily generated from customer deposits received in advance of shipments for products or rendering of services and are recognized as revenue when products are shipped and services are provided to the customer. We classify deferred revenue as current or non-current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue.\nThe following table provides a roll-forward of our contract liabilities, current and non-current:\nYear Ended October 31,\n(in millions)\nBeginning balance $ 692\nDeferral of revenue billed in current period, net of recognition 551\nDeferred revenue arising out of acquisitions 4\nRevenue recognized that was deferred as of the beginning of the period (490)\nForeign currency translation impact -\nEnding balance $ 757\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nOur expected remaining performance obligations, excluding contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, was approximately $581 million as of October 31, 2023, and represents the companys obligation to deliver products and services and obtain customer acceptance on delivered products. As of October 31, 2023, we expect to fulfill 51 percent of these remaining performance obligations in 2024, 33 percent in 2025 and 16 percent thereafter.\n4. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nKeysight accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including RSUs, employee stock purchases made under our ESPP, employee stock option awards, and performance share awards granted to selected members of our senior management under the LTP Program, based on estimated fair values.\nDescription of Keysights Share-Based Plans\nIncentive compensation plans. The 2014 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the \"2014 Stock Plan\") was originally adopted by our board of directors on July 16, 2014, with an effective date of November 1, 2014. It was subsequently amended and restated by our board of directors on September 29, 2014 and again on January 22, 2015. Our board of directors initially reserved 25 million shares of company common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Stock Plan, plus any shares forfeited or cancelled under the 2014 Stock Plan and subsequently reduced the number to 17 million shares. The 2014 Stock Plan was further amended and restated by our board of directors on November 16, 2017 to increase the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2014 Stock Plan to 21.8 million shares. The 2014 Stock Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares and performance units with performance-based conditions on vesting or exercisability, and cash awards. The 2014 Stock Plan has a term of ten years. As of October 31, 2023, approximately 4 million shares were available for future awards under the 2014 Stock Plan.\nStock options granted under the 2014 Stock Plan may be either \"incentive stock options,\" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or non-statutory. Options generally vest at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from\nthe date of grant with a maximum contractual term of ten years. The exercise price for stock options is generally not less than 100 percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date the stock award is granted.\nPerformance share awards granted under the LTP Program are administered under the 2014 Stock Plan for the company's executive officers and other key employees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted shares of the company's stock after the end of a three-year performance period, contingent upon the achievement of metrics and targets established by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee at the beginning of the performance period. The metrics for achievement of these awards can vary and may include total shareholder return (\"TSR\") or financial metrics, such as operating margin (OM), cost synergies and others. For TSR-based awards, the peer group comparisons are set at the beginning of the performance period. For OM-based awards, the performance targets are set each year in the first quarter of the respective year. The final payout under the LTP Program may range from zero to 200 percent of the target award based on actual performance. During fiscal year 2022, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee approved performance retention awards with a target earnings per share (EPS) goal over a three-year performance period to select members of our leadership team. The performance targets are set each half year. The payout range of the award is zero or 100 percent, with no additional payout for performance above target.\nRSUs under our share-based plans are granted to directors, executives and employees. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2014 Stock Plan is determined based on the market price of Keysight common stock on the date of grant. RSUs generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant.\nThe ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of Keysight common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at the purchase date. Shares authorized for issuance in connection with the ESPP are subject to an automatic annual increase of the lesser of one percent of the outstanding shares of Keysight common stock on November 1 or an amount determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our board of directors. Under the terms of the ESPP, in no event shall the number of shares issued under the ESPP exceed 75 million shares.\nUnder our ESPP, employees purchased 477,760 shares for $64 million in 2023, 462,279 shares for $62 million in 2022 and 541,241 shares for $56 million in 2021. As of October 31, 2023, common stock authorized and available for issuance under our ESPP was 18,382,477 shares, which includes shares issued in November 2023 to participants in consideration of the aggregate contribution of $32 million as of October 31, 2023.\nImpact of Share-based Compensation Awards\nShare-based compensation expense has been recognized using a straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period. The impact of share-based compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations was as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nCost of products and services $ 25 $ 23 $ 19\nResearch and development 38 28 21\nSelling, general and administrative 73 75 64\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 136 $ 126 $ 104\nIncome tax benefit realized from exercised stock options and similar awards $ 6 $ 15 $ 10\nValuation Assumptions\nThe TSR-based performance awards were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. The estimated fair value of restricted stock awards and the financial metrics-based performance awards (both OM and EPS) is determined based on the market price of Keysights common stock on the grant date. The compensation cost for financial metrics-based performance awards reflect the cost of awards that are probable to vest at the end of the performance period.\nThe following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of TSR-based performance awards.\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nVolatility of Keysight shares 35% 36% 36%\nVolatility of index 25% 23% 23%\nPrice-wise correlation with selected peers 75% 67% 67%\nShare-based Payment Award Activity\nEmployee Stock Options\nWe have not granted any stock options since fiscal 2015. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the options outstanding were approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, with a weighted average exercise price of $31 and $30, respectively. During 2023, 0.1 million options with an intrinsic value of $15 million were exercised at the weighted average exercise price of $30. The intrinsic value of the options exercised during 2022 and 2021 was $11 million and $14 million, respectively, at a weighted average exercise price of $25 and $26, respectively. The options outstanding as of October 31, 2023 have a weighted average contractual remaining life of 1 year and an intrinsic value of $7 million, based on Keysight's closing stock price of $122.05 at October 31, 2023.\nNon-vested Awards\nThe following table summarizes non-vested award activity in 2023 for our LTP Program and restricted stock unit awards:\nShares Weighted average grant date fair value per share\n(in thousands)\nNon-vested at October 31, 2022 2,092 $ 139\nGranted 880 173\nVested (904) 119\nForfeited (33) 161\nLTP Program incremental 114 130\nNon-vested at October 31, 2023 2,149 $ 160\nAs of October 31, 2023, the unrecognized share-based compensation cost for non-vested stock awards was approximately $139 million, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years. Unrecognized share-based compensation cost does not include expense for financial metrics-based performance awards for which the targets have not yet been set. The total fair value of stock awards that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $154 million, $223 million and $165 million, respectively. See Note 5, \"Income Taxes,\" for the tax impact on share-based award exercises and vesting.\n5. INCOME TAXES\nThe domestic and foreign components of income before taxes are:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nU.S. operations $ 237 $ 235 $ 89\nNon-U.S. operations 1,120 1,050 921\nTotal income before taxes $ 1,357 $ 1,285 $ 1,010\nThe provision for income taxes was comprised of:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nU.S. federal taxes:\nCurrent $ 185 $ 28 $ 71\nDeferred (54) (10) (10)\nNon-U.S. taxes:\nCurrent 105 113 90\nDeferred 54 19 (30)\nState taxes, net of federal benefit:\nCurrent 13 13 8\nDeferred (3) (2) (13)\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 300 $ 161 $ 116\nThe following table presents the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities:\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nDeferred Tax Assets\nInventory $ 28 $ 25\nIntangibles 482 522\nProperty, plant and equipment 29 24\nWarranty reserves 9 8\nPension benefits 18 18\nEmployee benefits, other than retirement 33 35\nNet operating loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards 275 296\nShare-based compensation 22 21\nDeferred revenue 43 41\nLease obligations 48 52\nHedging and currency costs 12 1\nR&D capitalization 45 -\nOthers 15 11\nTotal deferred tax assets 1,059 1,054\nTax valuation allowance (218) (224)\nTotal deferred tax assets less valuation allowance 841 830\nDeferred Tax Liabilities\nInventory $ - $ (1)\nIntangibles (31) (28)\nProperty, plant and equipment (23) (26)\nPension benefits (67) (70)\nEmployee benefits, other than retirement (1) (1)\nUnremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (11) (8)\nDeferred revenue (1) (1)\nROU lease assets (46) (50)\nHedging and currency costs (36) (30)\nOthers (6) (7)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (222) (222)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities $ 619 $ 608\nThe increase in deferred tax assets in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for the U.S. tax filing group due to a U.S. tax law change that became effective for Keysight on November 1, 2022. This is partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets in Singapore due to amortization and a decrease from U.K. net operating losses utilized and surrendered.\nThe total deferred tax liabilities in 2023 and 2022 remained the same, with other increases and decreases that are not individually significant.\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was a deferred tax liability of $11 million for the tax liability expected to be imposed upon the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested. As of October 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested was $105 million. No deferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings in the companys foreign operations. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested earnings was $4 million.\nValuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.\nThe $218 million and $224 million valuation allowances as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were mainly related to net operating losses in Luxembourg, capital losses and net operating losses in the U.K., and California research credits from acquired entities that are subject to change in ownership limitations.\nAt October 31, 2023, there were U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $5 million and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards, primarily from acquired entities, of $51 million. The U.S. federal net operating losses will expire in years beginning 2027 through 2029 if not utilized. Of the total U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards, $48 million was subject to change of ownership limitations under various state tax provisions and were subject to valuation allowance. The U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024, which will result in an immaterial tax impact if not utilized. At October 31, 2023, there were U.S. state research credit carryforwards of approximately $25 million. Of the total U.S. state research credit carryforwards, $21 million were California research credits that can be carried forward indefinitely. Due to change of ownership limitations, however, $21 million of California research credits were subject to valuation allowance.\nAt October 31, 2023, there were foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $941 million. Of the total foreign loss, $5 million will expire in years beginning 2024 through 2027. The remaining loss was comprised of $673 million that will expire in years beginning 2032 through 2040 if not utilized and $263 million that can be carried forward indefinitely. Of the $941 million of foreign net operating loss carryforward, $693 million were subject to a valuation allowance. At October 31, 2023, there were foreign capital loss carryforwards of $84 million that can be carried forward indefinitely and $2 million of tax credits in foreign jurisdictions that can be carried forward indefinitely. The foreign capital loss carryforwards were subject to valuation allowance as we do not expect to generate income of the type required in order to utilize these losses.\nThe differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective tax rate are:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nProfit before tax times statutory rate $ 285 $ 270 $ 212\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 8 8 (6)\nU.S. research credits (22) (14) (15)\nU.S. share-based compensation (5) (16) (11)\nU.S. officers compensation limitation 6 8 6\nCurrent U.S. tax on foreign earnings 139 53 58\nU.S. benefit on foreign sales (17) (17) (16)\nForeign earnings taxed at different rates (113) (115) (100)\nDeferred taxes on foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 6 (9) 1\nChange in unrecognized tax benefits 3 (26) 17\nAcquired entity integration - - (15)\nRelease of foreign valuation allowance - - (17)\nOther, net 10 19 2\nProvision for income taxes $ 300 $ 161 $ 116\nEffective tax rate 22 % 13 % 11 %\nThe effective tax rate was 22 percent, 13 percent, and 11 percent for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The tax rate in 2023 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental expenditures, partially offset by the net impact from the proportion of worldwide earnings taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions and the U.S. tax imposed on those non-U.S. earnings. The tax rate in 2022 and 2021 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of worldwide earnings that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. tax imposed on earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThere was an increase in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 of 9 percent, primarily due to a 5 percent increase from the impact of the U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental expenditures. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\") became effective for Keysight on November 1, 2022, requiring that research and experimental expenditures be capitalized for U.S. tax purposes. The capitalized expenses are amortized over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside the U.S. The capitalization of research and experimental expenditures increases the U.S. tax on non-U.S. earnings as part of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax. There was an additional 2 percent increase in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 due to a decrease in 2022 taxes resulting from changes in tax reserves. The other changes in the effective tax rate from 2022 to 2023 were not individually significant.\nThere was an increase in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 of 2 percent, primarily due to a 3 percent decrease in the 2021 effective tax rate from nonrecurring tax benefits, partially offset by a 3 percent decrease in 2022 effective tax rate from changes in tax reserves. The remaining 2 percent increase was comprised of various components that were not individually significant. The 2022 benefit from the change in tax reserves is primarily due to an audit settlement and an out-of-period adjustment. The 2021 significant nonrecurring tax benefits include the release of valuation allowance on Netherlands net operating losses in 2021 and a decrease due to the 2021 actual tax impact of acquired entity integration compared to the estimate at acquisition based on the finalization of the integration plan. The other changes in the effective tax rate from 2021 to 2022 were not individually significant.\nKeysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia, that will expire at various times in the future. These tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require thresholds of investments and employment in those jurisdictions. The Singapore tax incentive expires July 31, 2024, and the Malaysia tax incentive expires October 31, 2025. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of potential options on our effective tax rate. The impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by $95 million, $81 million and $70 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.53, $0.45 and $0.38 in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in tax benefit from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of non-U.S. earnings, which increased the earnings taxed at incentive tax rates in 2023.\nThe breakdown between current and long-term income tax assets and liabilities, excluding deferred tax assets and liabilities, was as follows for the years 2023 and 2022:\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nCurrent income tax assets (included within other current assets) $ 78 $ 49\nCurrent income tax liabilities (included within income and other taxes payable) (49) (58)\nLong-term income tax assets (included within other assets) 53 26\nLong-term income tax liabilities (included within other long-term liabilities) (210) (190)\nTotal $ (128) $ (173)\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds requires significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe aggregate changes in the balances of our unrecognized tax benefits including all federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions are as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nGross Balance, beginning of year $ 234 $ 249 $ 237\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year 37 32 19\nAdditions for tax positions from prior years 1 5 -\nReductions for tax positions from prior years - (25) (2)\nSettlements with taxing authorities - (3) -\nStatute of limitations expirations (5) (4) (4)\nImpact from currency fluctuations (1) (20) (1)\nGross Balance, end of year $ 266 $ 234 $ 249\nAs of October 31, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, was $266 million, of which, if recognized, $176 million would impact our effective tax rate. However, approximately $1 million of the unrecognized tax benefits was related to acquisitions, which, if recognized within certain agreed upon time periods, would result in the recognition of an offsetting indemnification asset.\nCumulatively, interest and penalties accrued as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $41 million, $36 million and $37 million, respectively. We recognized tax expense of $5 million, $3 million and $4 million for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe open tax years for the U.S. federal income tax return and most state income tax returns are from November 1, 2019 through the current tax year. For the majority of our non-U.S. entities, the open tax years are from November 1, 2017 through the current tax year. For certain non-U.S. entities, the tax years remain open, at most, back to the year 2008.\nThe company is being audited in Malaysia for fiscal year 2008. This tax year predates our separation from Agilent. However, pursuant to the agreement between Agilent and Keysight pertaining to tax matters, as finalized at the time of separation, for certain entities, including Malaysia, any historical tax liability is the responsibility of Keysight. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, Keysight paid income taxes and penalties of $68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights. The company believes there are strong technical defenses to the current assessment; the statute of limitations for the fiscal year 2008 in Malaysia was closed, and the income in question is exempt from tax in Malaysia. The company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all available recourses to resolve this issue favorably for the company. Our appeals to both the Special Commissioners of Income Tax and the High Court in Malaysia have been unsuccessful. The final hearing with the Court of Appeal took place on October 23, 2023. The decision is expected to be rendered on February 29, 2024. There are limited further legal options available after the conclusion is returned from the Court of Appeal.\nAt this time, management does not believe that the outcome of any future or currently ongoing examination will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with managements current expectations. If that were to occur, it could have an impact on our effective tax rate in the period in which such examinations are resolved.\n6. NET INCOME PER SHARE\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions, except per-share amounts)\nNet income $ 1,057 $ 1,124 $ 894\nBasic weighted-average shares 178 180 185\nPotential common shares 1 2 2\nDiluted weighted-average shares 179 182 187\nNet income per share - basic $ 5.95 $ 6.23 $ 4.84\nNet income per share - diluted $ 5.91 $ 6.18 $ 4.78\nThe dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury stock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and non-vested RSUs. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay to exercise stock options and unamortized share-based compensation expense are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares.\nWe exclude stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of our common stock from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021, we excluded zero shares from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. In addition, we also exclude from the calculation of diluted earnings per share stock options, ESPP, LTP program awards and restricted stock awards, whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value collectively were greater than the average market price of our common stock because their effect would also be anti-dilutive. The number of shares excluded was immaterial in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n7. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe goodwill balances as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the movements in 2023 and 2022 for each of our reportable segments were as follows:\nCSG EISG Total\n(in millions)\nGoodwill at October 31, 2021 $ 1,069 $ 559 $ 1,628\nForeign currency translation impact (56) (10) (66)\nGoodwill arising from acquisitions 9 11 20\nGoodwill at October 31, 2022 1,022 560 1,582\nForeign currency translation impact (1) 3 2\nGoodwill arising from acquisitions 36 20 56\nGoodwill at October 31, 2023 $ 1,057 $ 583 $ 1,640\nThere were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. As of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, accumulated impairment losses on goodwill were $709 million.\nOther intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\nOctober 31, 2023 October 31, 2022\nGross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Book Value\n(in millions)\nDeveloped technology $ 1,033 $ 949 $ 84 $ 992 $ 914 $ 78\nBacklog 19 17 2 17 17 -\nTrademark/Tradename 36 33 3 36 31 5\nCustomer relationships 406 340 66 393 287 106\nTotal $ 1,494 $ 1,339 $ 155 $ 1,438 $ 1,249 $ 189\nIn 2023, we recorded additions to goodwill and other intangible assets of $56 million and $56 million, respectively, related to our acquisition of Cliosoft. For additional information, see Note 2, \"Acquisitions.\"\nAmortization of other intangible assets was $90 million in 2023, $103 million in 2022 and $174 million in 2021. Estimated future amortization expense for our intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 is as follows:\nAmortization expense\n(in millions)\n2024 $ 53\n2025 $ 35\n2026 $ 24\n2027 $ 18\n2028 $ 14\nThereafter $ 11\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of September 30, after the annual update to our long-term financial forecasts, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. The impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with an impairment charge recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.\nWe determine fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded comparable companies. The selections of comparable businesses are based on the markets in which our reporting units operate, giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value.\nAs of October 31, 2023, we determined that no goodwill impairment exists and that the remaining goodwill is recoverable for all of our reporting units; however, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired in future periods. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate.\n8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets, or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3 - applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nOctober 31,\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Other\n(in millions)\nAssets:\nShort-term\nCash equivalents\nMoney market funds $ 1,934 $ 1,934 $ - $ - $ - $ 1,338 $ 1,338 $ - $ - $ -\nDerivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) 18 - 18 - - 21 - 21 - -\nLong-term\nDerivative instruments (interest rate swaps) - - - - - 133 - 133 - -\nEquity investments 56 56 - - - 50 50 - - -\nInvestments - other 25 - - - 25 12 - - - 12\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 2,033 $ 1,990 $ 18 $ - $ 25 $ 1,554 $ 1,388 $ 154 $ - $ 12\nLiabilities: -\nShort-term\nDerivative instruments (foreign exchange contracts) $ 54 $ - $ 54 $ - $ - $ 12 $ - $ 12 $ - $ -\nLong-term\nDeferred compensation liability 27 - 27 - - 22 - 22 - -\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ 81 $ - $ 81 $ - $ - $ 34 $ - $ 34 $ - $ -\nIn 2023, we terminated forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, resulting in a deferred gain of $107 million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the anticipated debt. See Note 9, \"Derivatives,\" for additional information.\nIn 2023, we made a cost method investment of $7 million classified as \"investments - other\" in the table above. The changes in fair value of equity investments are recorded within \"other income (expense), net\" in the consolidated statement of operations.\nOur money market funds and equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and, therefore, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Equity and fixed income investments or convertible notes without readily determinable fair values that are either measured at cost, adjusted for observable changes in price or impairments, or accounted for under a measurement alternative are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are presented as \"Investments - other\" in the table above. Our deferred compensation liability is classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in the calculations are observable, although the values are not directly based on quoted market prices. Our derivative financial instruments are classified within Level 2 as there is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets.\nEquity investments, including securities that are earmarked to pay the deferred compensation liability, and the deferred compensation liability are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Certain derivative instruments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAll of our investments are subject to periodic impairment review. The impairment analysis requires judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of the investment. There were no impairments recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investments are recorded in earnings. Net unrealized gain (loss) on our equity and other investments was a gain of $7 million in 2023, a loss of $36 million in 2022, and a gain of $4 million in 2021. There were no realized gains or losses from the sale of investments in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis consisted of goodwill and intangible assets. See Note 7, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" for more information.\nGoodwill\nFair value assessments of the reporting unit and the reporting unit's net assets, which are performed for goodwill impairment tests, are considered Level 3 measurements due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. In the event of performing a quantitative impairment test, we consider a market approach as well as an income approach using the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nFair value of intangible assets are considered Level 3 measurements due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. In the event of performing a quantitative impairment test, we utilize an income approach for estimating the fair value of intangible assets. The future cash flows used in the analysis are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long-range plans and include significant assumptions by management.\nLong Lived Assets\nIn 2022, our held and used long-lived assets in Russia with a carrying amount of $3 million were written down to a fair value of zero, resulting from an impairment of assets that were expected to generate zero cash flows in the future, and was recorded within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statement of operations.\n9. DERIVATIVES\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of our business. As part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge economic and/or accounting exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The changes in the value of the derivative instrument included in the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings, when the forecasted transaction occurs, in the same financial statement line item in the consolidated statement of operations where the earnings effect of the hedged item is presented. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the hedge relationship will be de-designated and amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the current period. Gains and losses on the derivative instrument representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are amortized to earnings on a straight-line basis over the tenor of the hedge and are presented in the same financial statement line of the consolidated statement of operations where the earnings effect of the hedged item is presented.\nIn 2020, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600 million associated with future interest payments on anticipated debt issuances through fiscal year 2024. The contract term allows us to lock in a treasury rate on anticipated debt issuances. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in the authoritative guidance. The changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In 2023, we terminated the interest rate swap agreements, resulting in a deferred gain of $107 million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be amortized to interest expense over the term of the anticipated debt.\nOther Hedges\nAdditionally, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in value of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations in the current period along with the offsetting foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.\nIn connection with the acquisition of ESI Group SA (see Note 17, \"Subsequent Event\"), we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the currency exchange risk associated with the payment of the purchase price in Euro. The aggregate notional amount of the currencies hedged was 930 million euros as of October 31, 2023. These foreign exchange contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting unrealized loss on outstanding contracts was $45 million and was recorded in \"other income (expense), net\" and \"other accrued liabilities\" in the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated balance sheet, respectively, for the year ended October 31, 2023.\nOur use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions, which are selected based on their credit ratings and other factors. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk that include establishing counterparty credit limits, monitoring credit exposures, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.\nThe number of open foreign exchange forward contracts designated as \"cash flow hedges\" and \"not designated as hedging instruments\" was 180 and 77, respectively, as of October 31, 2023. The aggregated notional amounts by currency and designation as of October 31, 2023 were as follows:\nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nForward Contracts Forward Contracts\nCurrency Buy/(Sell) Buy/(Sell)\n(in millions)\nEuro $ - $ 1,125\nBritish Pound 3 (24)\nSingapore Dollar 34 10\nMalaysian Ringgit 113 11\nJapanese Yen (148) (32)\nOther currencies (23) (23)\nTotal $ (21) $ 1,067\nDerivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are disclosed at their gross fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. The gross fair values and balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments held as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nAssets Derivatives Liabilities Derivatives\nFair Value Fair Value\nBalance Sheet Location October 31,\n2023 October 31,\n2022 Balance Sheet Location October 31,\n2023 October 31,\n(in millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nCash flow hedges\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther current assets $ 16 $ 18 Other accrued liabilities $ 7 $ 10\nInterest rate swap contracts:\nOther assets - 133\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther current assets 2 3 Other accrued liabilities 47 2\nTotal derivatives $ 18 $ 154 $ 54 $ 12\nThe effect of derivative instruments for foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments and not designated as hedging instruments in our consolidated statement of operations was as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nCash flow hedges\nInterest rate swap contracts:\nGain (loss) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (26) $ 85 $ 26\nForeign exchange contracts:\nGain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 7 7 6\nGain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings:\nCost of products\n8 13 -\nSelling, general and administrative\n(1) (10) 2\nGain excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in earnings based on amortization approach:\nCost of products\n5 2 1\nSelling, general and administrative - 1 1\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nGain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net\n$ (44) $ 22 $ (3)\nThe estimated amount at October 31, 2023 expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings within the next twelve months is a gain of $8 million.\n10. LEASES\nWe have operating leases for items including office space, manufacturing and production locations, sales and service centers, research and development facilities and certain equipment, primarily automobiles. Our leases have remaining terms of up to 15 years, which represent the non-cancellable periods of the leases and include extension options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. The weighted average lease term of our operating leases was 7.8 years, 7.7 years and 8.2 years as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of our operating leases was 3 percent as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our lease cost:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nOperating lease cost $ 52 $ 51 $ 51\nVariable lease cost $ 22 $ 17 $ 14\nShort-term lease costs, sublease income and finance lease costs were immaterial for the year ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Right-of-use (ROU) asset impairments were $2 million in 2022 related to the discontinuance of our Russia operations.

Other lessor arrangements were immaterial.\n11. DEBT\nThe following table summarizes the components of our debt:\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\n2024 Senior Notes at 4.55% ($600 face amount less unamortized costs of $1 and $1)\n$ 599 $ 599\n2027 Senior Notes at 4.60% ($700 face amount less unamortized costs of $2 and $3)\n698 697\n2029 Senior Notes at 3.00% ($500 face amount less unamortized costs of $3 and $3)\n497 497\nTotal Debt 1,794 1,793\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt 599 -\nLong-Term Debt $ 1,195 $ 1,793\nShort-Term Debt\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn July 30, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) which provides for a $750 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on July 30, 2026 with an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 1 percent along with a facility fee of 0.125 percent per annum. On February 17, 2023, we entered into the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility to change the annual interest rate from LIBOR + 1 percent to SOFR + 1.1 percent. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility permits the company, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions to request to increase the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $250 million in the aggregate. We may use amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended October 31, 2023.\n2024 Senior Notes\nIn October 2014, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in unsecured senior notes (\"2024 Senior Notes\"). The 2024 Senior Notes were issued at 99.966 percent of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 30, 2024, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.55 percent per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year. We incurred issuance costs of $5 million in connection with the 2024 Senior Notes that, along with the debt discount, are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes.\nLong-Term Debt\n2027 Senior Notes\nIn April 2017, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $700 million in unsecured senior notes (\"2027 Senior Notes\").

The interest is payable semi-annually on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing on April 30, 2020. We incurred issuance costs of $4 million in connection with the 2029 Senior Notes that, along with the debt discount, are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes.\nThe above senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. We were in compliance with the covenants of our senior notes during the year ended October 31, 2023.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $41 million and $38 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that were issued by various lenders.\n12. RETIREMENT PLANS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\nGeneral. The majority of our employees are covered under various defined benefit and/or defined contribution retirement plans. Additionally, we sponsor post-retirement health care benefits for our eligible U.S. employees. We provide U.S. employees who meet eligibility criteria under the Keysight Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (\"RP\"), defined benefits that are based on an employee's base or target pay during the years of employment and length of service. For eligible employees' service through October 31, 1993, the benefit payable under the RP is reduced by any amounts due to the eligible employees' service under our defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (\"DPSP\"), which was closed to new participants as of November 1993. The obligations under the DPSP equal the fair value of the DPSP assets, which was $164 million as of October 31, 2023. Employees hired on or after August 1, 2015 are not eligible to participate in the RP or the Keysight Technologies, Inc. Health Plan for Retirees (\"U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan\").\nIn addition, in the U.S. we maintain the Supplemental Benefits Retirement Plan (\"SBRP\"), a supplemental unfunded non-qualified defined benefit plan to provide benefits that would be provided under the RP but for limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The RP and the SBRP comprise the \"U.S. Plans.\"\nEligible employees outside the U.S. generally receive retirement benefits under various retirement plans (\"Non-U.S. Plans\") based on factors such as years of service and/or employee compensation levels. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local statutory requirements. Certain of our immaterial non-U.S. defined benefit plans are not included in these disclosures.\n401(k) defined contribution plan. Eligible U.S. employees may participate in the Keysight Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the \"401(k) Plan\"). Enrollment in the 401(k) Plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. We provide matching contributions of up to 4 percent of annual eligible compensation for employees hired prior to August 1, 2015 and up to 6 percent for employees hired thereafter. The 401(k) Plan employer expense included in income from operations was $34 million in 2023, $31 million in 2022 and $28 million in 2021.\nPost-retirement medical benefit plans. In addition to receiving retirement benefits, U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements as of their termination date may participate in the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost. We record the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) in the same line item as other employee compensation costs. We record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost (benefit), such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, within \"other income (expense), net\" in the consolidated statement of operations. The company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For the U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime of active plan participants. For most Non-U.S. Plans and the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, we recognized a settlement gain of $1 million in our Japan defined benefit plan and a settlement loss of $9 million in our U.K. defined benefit plan, respectively, as the lump-sum payments in the respective plans were more than the sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (the threshold amount). In March 2021, we transferred substantially all the assets and obligations of our Netherlands defined benefit plan to an insurance company. This partial settlement resulted in a net refund of $3 million and a loss of $16 million in 2021, which is included in \"other income (expense), net\" in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, components of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income were comprised of:\nDefined Benefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan\nU.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nNet periodic benefit cost (benefit)\nService cost - benefits earned during the period $ 16 $ 25 $ 24 $ 10 $ 13 $ 15 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1\nInterest cost on benefit obligation 36 23 22 31 15 15 8 5 4\nExpected return on plan assets (49) (61) (52) (53) (58) (77) (12) (14) (12)\nAmortization:\nNet actuarial loss\n9 11 24 9 24 41 2 1 11\nPrior service credit\n- - - - - - (1) (1) (1)\nNet periodic benefit cost (benefit) 12 (2) 18 (3) (6) (6) (2) (8) 3\nCurtailments and settlements - - - (1) 9 16 - - -\nTotal periodic benefit cost (benefit) $ 12 $ (2) $ 18 $ (4) $ 3 $ 10 $ (2) $ (8) $ 3\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss\nNet actuarial loss (gain) $ 14 $ (9) $ (100) $ 32 $ (38) $ 26 $ (5) $ 17 $ (38)\nAmortization:\nNet actuarial loss (9) (11) (24) (9) (24) (41) (2) (1) (11)\nPrior service credit - - - - - - 1 1 1\nCurtailments and settlements - - - 1 (9) (16) - - -\nForeign currency - - - (2) (6) 1 - - -\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss $ 5 $ (20) $ (124) $ 22 $ (77) $ (30) $ (6) $ 17 $ (48)\nTotal recognized in the periodic benefit cost (benefit) and other comprehensive (income) loss $ 17 $ (22) $ (106) $ 18 $ (74) $ (20) $ (8) $ 9 $ (45)\nFunded status. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the funded status of the defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans was as follows:\nU.S. Defined\nBenefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined\nBenefit Plans U.S.\nPost-Retirement\nBenefit Plan\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in millions)\nChange in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value - beginning of year $ 640 $ 862 $ 1,003 $ 1,608 $ 155 $ 207\nActual return on plan assets 25 (169) (23) (283) 12 (38)\nEmployer contributions 1 - 12 11 - -\nSettlements (1) - (3) (12) - -\nBenefits paid (43) (53) (41) (37) (14) (14)\nCurrency impact - - 37 (284) - -\nFair value - end of year $ 622 $ 640 $ 985 $ 1,003 $ 153 $ 155\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation - beginning of year $ 636 $ 881 $ 819 $ 1,465 $ 146 $ 190\nService cost 16 25 10 13 1 1\nInterest cost 36 23 31 15 8 5\nSettlements (1) - (3) (12) - -\nCurtailments - - - - - -\nActuarial loss (gain) (10) (239) (44) (380) (5) (36)\nBenefits paid (43) (54) (41) (37) (14) (14)\nCurrency impact - - 38 (245) - -\nBenefit obligation - end of year $ 634 $ 636 $ 810 $ 819 $ 136 $ 146\nOverfunded (Underfunded) status of PBO $ (12) $ 4 $ 175 $ 184 $ 17 $ 9\nAmounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet consist of:\nOther assets\n$ - $ 11 $ 205 $ 211 $ 17 $ 9\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n(1) (1) - - - -\nRetirement and post-retirement benefits\n(11) (6) (30) (27) - -\nNet asset (liability) $ (12) $ 4 $ 175 $ 184 $ 17 $ 9\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss:\nActuarial losses (gains) $ 86 $ 81 $ 403 $ 380 $ (11) $ (4)\nPrior service cost (credits) - - - 1 - (1)\nTotal $ 86 $ 81 $ 403 $ 381 $ (11) $ (5)\nThe change in benefit obligations for the U.S. and Non-U.S. defined benefit plans for 2023 was driven by changes in discount rates, partially offset by changes in demographic assumptions. The change in benefit obligations for the U.S. and Non-U.S. defined benefit plans for 2022 was driven by the changes in actuarial assumptions, primarily discount rates and lump sum conversion rates. The change in benefit obligations for the U.S. post-retirement benefit plan for 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by changes in discount rates.\nInvestment policies and strategies as of October 31, 2023. In the U.S., our RP and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan target asset allocations are approximately 70 percent to equities, including growth-seeking, and approximately 30 percent to fixed income investments. Our DPSP target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. The general investment objective for all our plan assets is to obtain the optimum rate of investment return on the total investment portfolio consistent with the assumed level of risk. Specific investment objectives for the plans' portfolios are to: maintain and enhance the purchasing power of the plans' assets; achieve investment returns consistent with the level of risk being taken; and earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. Outside of the U.S., our target asset allocation is from 21 to 70 percent to equities, from 28 to 54 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 51 percent to insurance contracts and cash. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in capital markets, our actual allocations of plan assets as of October 31, 2023 may differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to periodically bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.\nEquity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds. Investments in commingled funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) method as a practical expedient. Investments valued using the NAV method are allocated across a broad array of funds and diversify the portfolio. The value of the plan assets directly affects the funded status of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans recorded in the financial statements. In March 2021, we entered into an insurance buy-in contract for a portion of benefit obligations under the U.K. defined benefit plan and classified it as Other Investment. In December 2021, we completed the second phase of the same contract. The insurance buy-in contract is similar to an annuity contract, which matches cash flows with future benefit payments for a specific group of pensioners with the obligation remaining with the plan. This contract is issued by a third-party insurance company with no affiliation to us. The insurance contract is valued on an insurer pricing basis, which reflects the purchase price adjusted for changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, which approximates fair value.\nFair Value. The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in Note 8, \"Fair Value Measurements.\"\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds that are invested in short-term domestic fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics, emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Cash and cash equivalents are generally classified as Level 2 investments except when the cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds, which have a daily NAV derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as assets measured at NAV.\nEquity - Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock are held in commingled funds, which have daily NAVs derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as assets measured at NAV. Commingled funds that have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments. Equity also includes some growth-seeking real estate commingled funds that are measured at NAV.\nFixed Income - Some fixed income securities are held in commingled funds that have daily NAVs derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as assets measured at NAV. Commingled funds that have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments. Some fixed income securities that are not actively traded and are valued basis inputs, such as quoted price of similar securities, or other inputs that can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data are classified as Level 2 investments.\nOther Investment - Other investment represents the U.K. insurance buy-in contract and is classified as a Level 3 investment. Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 investments.\nThe following tables present the fair value of U.S. Defined Benefit Plans assets classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFair Value Measurement\nas of October 31, 2023 Using\nTotal Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) Assets Measured at NAV(a)\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nEquity 446 - - - 446\nFixed income 176 - - - 176\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 622 $ - $ - $ - $ 622\n(a) Certain instruments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents expected future benefit payments for the next 10 years.\nU.S. Defined\nBenefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined\nBenefit Plans U.S. Post-Retirement\nBenefit Plan\n(in millions)\n2024 $ 52 $ 42 $ 15\n2025 $ 60 $ 42 $ 15\n2026 $ 61 $ 44 $ 16\n2027 $ 61 $ 47 $ 16\n2028 $ 62 $ 49 $ 16\n2029 - 2033 $ 300 $ 255 $ 67\nAssumptions. The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios, consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and other investments, in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-term rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans, which is October 31. The U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The Non-U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were determined based on a granular approach, which discounts the expected plan benefit payments with rates from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve. In addition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost: service cost and interest cost. The range of assumptions that were used for the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.\nAssumptions used to calculate the net periodic benefit cost (benefit) were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022\nU.S. Defined Benefit Plans:\nDiscount rate 6.00% 2.75%\nAverage increase in compensation levels 3.50% 3.50%\nExpected long-term return on assets 8.00% 7.25%\nNon-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans:\nDiscount rate 1.87-4.22%\n0.70-1.86%\nAverage increase in compensation levels 2.50-3.00%\n2.50-2.75%\nExpected long-term return on assets 4.16-7.00%\n3.00-6.50%\nU.S. Post-Retirement Benefits Plan:\nDiscount rate 6.00% 2.75%\nExpected long-term return on assets 8.00% 7.25%\nCurrent medical cost trend rate 7.00% 6.00%\nUltimate medical cost trend rate 4.75% 4.50%\nMedical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2029 2028\nAssumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022\nU.S. Defined Benefit Plans:\nDiscount rate 6.50% 6.00%\nAverage increase in compensation levels 3.50% 3.50%\nNon-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans:\nDiscount rate 2.50-5.35%\n1.87-4.22%\nAverage increase in compensation levels 2.50-3.00%\n2.50-3.00%\nU.S. Post-Retirement Benefits Plan:\nDiscount rate 6.50% 6.00%\nCurrent medical cost trend rate 6.50% 7.00%\nUltimate medical cost trend rate 4.75% 4.75%\nMedical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year 2029 2029\nHealth care trend rates did not have a significant effect on the total service and interest cost components or on the post-retirement benefit obligation amounts reported for the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022.\n13. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following tables provide details of selected balance sheet items:\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,472 $ 2,042\nRestricted cash included in other assets 16 15\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 2,488 $ 2,057\nRestricted cash primarily relates to deficit reduction contributions to an escrow account for one of our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and deposits held as collateral against bank guarantees.\nInventory\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nFinished goods $ 376 $ 322\nPurchased parts and fabricated assemblies 609 536\nTotal inventory $ 985 $ 858\nThe increase in inventory in 2023 was primarily driven by incremental stock build-up to secure supply to support order fulfillment along with an increase in demo inventory. Gross inventory-related excess and obsolescence charges recorded in cost of products were $27 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021. We record excess and obsolete inventory charges for inventory at our sites and at our contract manufacturers and suppliers, where we have non-cancellable purchase commitments.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nLand $ 48 $ 48\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 828 798\nMachinery and equipment 1,508 1,385\nTotal property, plant and equipment 2,384 2,231\nAccumulated depreciation of property, plant and equipment (1,623) (1,541)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 761 $ 690\nThe increase in property, plant and equipment, net, in 2023 is primarily driven by increased capital spending for capacity expansion and technology investments. Asset impairments were zero in 2023, $1 million in 2022 and zero in 2021. Depreciation expense was $120 million in 2023, $117 million in 2022 and $117 million in 2021.\nStandard warranty\nActivity related to the standard warranty accrual, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, is as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nBeginning balance $ 32 $ 34\nAccruals for warranties, including change in estimates 33 23\nSettlements made during the period (29) (25)\nEnding balance $ 36 $ 32\nAccruals for warranties due within one year $ 22 $ 20\nAccruals for warranties due after one year 14 12\nEnding balance $ 36 $ 32\nOther current assets\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nPrepaid expenses $ 284 $ 280\nOther current assets 168 149\nTotal other current assets $ 452 $ 429\nPrepaid expenses include deposits paid in advance to contract manufacturers of $210 million and $199 million as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based on mutually agreed criteria. As of October 31, 2023, our non-cancellable purchase commitments were approximately $467 million. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year or based on mutually agreed terms.\nOther purchase commitments. Other purchase commitments primarily relate to software as a service and other professional services contracts. As of October 31, 2023, our non-cancellable contractual obligations related to these contracts were approximately $75 million.\nWe also have long-term power purchase agreements to purchase power at predominantly variable prices. These agreements are expected to support our power consumption needs with more favorable pricing and reliability than our previous supply agreements.\nLitigation and contingencies. On August 3, 2021, we entered into a Consent Agreement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"). Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, we were assessed a penalty of $6.6 million to be paid over three years, $2.5 million of which was suspended and designated for remediation activities over three years, including employment of a special compliance officer. To date, we have paid $3.1 million of the penalty. The suspended portion of the penalty has been satisfied by amounts we have spent on qualifying compliance activities to date.\nOn January 1, 2022, Centripetal Networks filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Virginia, alleging that certain Keysight products infringe certain of Centripetals patents. In addition, in February 2022 Centripetal filed complaints in Germany alleging infringement of certain of Centripetals German patents, and in April 2022 Centripetal filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC) requesting that they investigate whether Keysight should be enjoined from importing certain products that are manufactured outside of the U.S. and which are alleged to infringe Centripetal patents. We deny the allegations and are aggressively defending each case.\nAlthough there are no matters pending that we currently believe are probable and reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business, consolidated financial position, or results of operations or cash flows, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and is difficult to predict. An adverse outcome in any outstanding lawsuit or proceeding could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief. If adverse results are above managements expectations or are unforeseen, management may not have accrued for the liability, which could impact our results in a financial period.\nWe are also involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.\nIndemnification Obligations Related to Transactions\nIn connection with acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, spin-offs and other transactions, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties for future damages, losses, expenses and liabilities that were incurred prior to or are related to such transactions. The liabilities covered by these indemnifications include, but are not limited to, tax, employment, benefits, intellectual property, environmental, and other liabilities. We do not believe that our indemnification obligations related to such liabilities were material as of October 31, 2023.\nIndemnifications to Officers and Directors\nOur corporate by-laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to Keysight and such other entities, including service with respect to employee benefit plans. In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board-appointed officer of Keysight that provide for indemnification under similar and additional circumstances. The indemnification obligations are more fully described in our corporate by-laws and the indemnification agreements, which are available on our website. We purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers. Since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by-laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. We have not historically made payments related to these obligations, and do not believe that our indemnification obligations related to such claims were material as of October 31, 2023.\nOther Indemnifications\nAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and we do not believe that our indemnification obligations related to such claims were material as of October 31, 2023.\n15. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn March 6, 2023, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1,500 million of the companys common stock, replacing the previously approved November 2021 program authorizing the purchase of up to $1,200 million of the companys common stock, of which $225 million remained.\nUnder our stock repurchase program, shares may be purchased from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for at the trade date using the cost method. The stock repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time at the companys discretion and does not have an expiration date.\nIn 2023, we repurchased 4,913,548 shares of common stock for $702 million. Additionally, we accrued $4 million related to excise tax levied on share repurchases, net of issuances. In 2022 we repurchased 5,442,280 shares of common stock for $849 million. In 2021 we repurchased 4,361,542 shares of common stock for $673 million. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for at the trade date using the cost method.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\nThe following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax effect:\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nForeign currency translation, net of tax (expense) of $(63) and $(63)\n$ (167) $ (185)\nUnrealized losses on defined benefit plans, net of tax benefit of $94 and $84\n(388) (379)\nGains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax (expense) of $(25) and $(30)\n89 110\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (466) $ (454)\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component and related tax effects were as follows:\nNet defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs:\nForeign currency translation Actuarial losses Prior service credits Gains (losses) on derivatives Total\n(in millions)\nAt October 31, 2021 $ (20) $ (456) $ (6) $ 40 $ (442)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (165) 36 - 92 (37)\nAmounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) - 47 - (3) 44\nTax benefit (expense) - - - (19) (19)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (165) 83 - 70 (12)\nAt October 31, 2022 (185) (373) (6) 110 (454)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 18 (39) - (19) (40)\nAmounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) - 20 - (7) 13\nTax benefit (expense) - 10 - 5 15\nOther comprehensive income (loss) 18 (9) - (21) (12)\nAt October 31, 2023 $ (167) $ (382) $ (6) $ 89 $ (466)\nReclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings were as follows:\nDetails about accumulated other comprehensive loss components Amounts reclassified from other comprehensive loss Affected line item in statement of operations\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022\n(in millions)\nGain (loss) on derivatives $ 8 $ 13 Cost of products\n(1) (10) Selling, general and administrative\n(1) - Benefit (provision) for income taxes\n6 3 Net of income tax\nNet defined benefit pension cost and post retirement plan costs:\nNet actuarial losses (20) (47) Other income (expense), net\n4 5 Benefit (provision) for income taxes\n(16) (42) Net of income tax\nTotal reclassifications for the period $ (10) $ (39) Net of income tax\n16. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nOur operating segments were determined based primarily on how the chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Segment operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services, and manufacturing are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.\nDescriptions of our two reportable segments are as follows:\nThe Communications Solutions Group (\"CSG\") serves customers spanning the global commercial communications and aerospace, defense, and government end markets. The groups solutions consist of electronic design and test software, instrumentation, systems, and related services. These solutions are used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacturing, installation, and optimization of communication systems in wireless, wireline, enterprise, and aerospace, defense and government end markets. In addition, the group provides automated software test solutions that include AI-ML to automatically identify, build, and execute tests critical to digital business success and a strong customer experience.\nThe Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (\"EISG\") serves customers across a diverse set of end markets focused on automotive and energy, semiconductor solutions, and general electronics. The group's solutions consist of electronic design and test software, instrumentation, systems, and related services. These solutions are used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacturing, installation, and optimization of electronic equipment. In addition, the group provides automated software test solutions that include AI-ML to automatically identify, build, and execute tests critical to digital business success and a strong customer experience.\nA significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from allocated corporate charges, as well as expenses related to our centralized sales force, and service, marketing and technology functions that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. Corporate charges include legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Segment allocations are determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to, or benefits received by, the segments. Newly acquired businesses are not allocated these charges until integrated into our shared services and corporate infrastructure.\nThe following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.\nThe profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, interest income, interest expense and other items as noted in the reconciliations below.\nCSG EISG Total\n(in millions)\nYear ended October 31, 2023:\nTotal and segment revenue $ 3,685 $ 1,779 $ 5,464\nSegment income from operations $ 1,068 $ 581 $ 1,649\nDepreciation expense $ 81 $ 39 $ 120\nYear ended October 31, 2022:\nTotal and segment revenue $ 3,803 $ 1,617 $ 5,420\nSegment income from operations $ 1,085 $ 501 $ 1,586\nDepreciation expense $ 88 $ 29 $ 117\nYear ended October 31, 2021:\nTotal and segment revenue $ 3,523 $ 1,418 $ 4,941\nSegment income from operations $ 932 $ 444 $ 1,376\nDepreciation expense $ 91 $ 26 $ 117\nThe following table reconciles reportable segments' income from operations to our total enterprise income before taxes:\nYear Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nTotal reportable segments' income from operations $ 1,649 $ 1,586 $ 1,376\nShare-based compensation (136) (126) (104)\nAmortization of acquisition-related balances (90) (103) (174)\nAcquisition and integration costs (13) (9) (9)\nRestructuring and other (52) (14) (9)\nIncome from operations, as reported 1,358 1,334 1,080\nInterest income 102 16 3\nInterest expense (78) (79) (79)\nOther income (expense), net (25) 14 6\nIncome before taxes, as reported $ 1,357 $ 1,285 $ 1,010\nMajor customers.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nOn November 3, 2023, we acquired 50.6% of the share capital of ESI Group SA (\"ESI Group\") for approximately $512 million, using existing cash. On November 7, 2023, we filed a tender offer to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of ESI Group at a price per share of 155 euros, to be primarily funded by approximately $457 million placed in an escrow account. Should the tender offer result in ESI Group's remaining minority shareholders holding no more than 10 percent of ESI Group's share capital and voting rights, then Keysight intends to proceed with a mandatory squeeze-out of all remaining ESI Group shares at the end of the tender offer period and to delist ESI Group from Euronext Paris. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A.
