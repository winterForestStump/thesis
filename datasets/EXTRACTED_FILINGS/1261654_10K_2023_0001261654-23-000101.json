    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nUniversal Technical Institute, Inc., which together with its subsidiaries is referred to as the Company, we, us or our, was founded in 1965 and is a leading workforce solutions provider of transportation, skilled trades and healthcare education programs, whose mission is to serve students, partners, and communities by providing quality education and support services for in-demand careers across a number of highly-skilled fields. We offer the majority of our programs in a blended learning model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. In conjunction with the Concorde Career Colleges, Inc. acquisition on December 1, 2022 (the Concorde Acquisition), we redefined our reporting structure into two reportable segments (also referred to as divisions) as follows:\nUniversal Technical Institute (UTI): UTI operates 16 campuses located in nine states and offers a wide range of degree and non-degree transportation and skilled trades technical training programs under brands such as Universal Technical Institute, Motorcycle Mechanics Institute and Marine Mechanics Institute (collectively, MMI), NASCAR Technical Institute (NASCAR Tech), and MIAT College of Technology (MIAT). UTI also offers manufacturer specific advanced training programs, which include student-paid electives, at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at certain campuses and dedicated training centers. Lastly, UTI provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers.\nConcorde Career Colleges (Concorde): Concorde operates 17 campuses located in eight states and online, offering degree, non-degree, and continuing education programs in the allied health, dental, nursing, patient care and diagnostic fields. The Company has designated campuses that offer degree granting programs Concorde Career College; where allowed by State regulation. The remaining campuses are designated as Concorde Career Institute. Concorde believes in preparing students for their healthcare careers with practical, hands-on experiences including opportunities to learn while providing care to real patients. Prior to graduation, students will complete a number of hours in a clinical setting or externship, depending upon their program of study. We acquired Concorde on December 1, 2022.\nCorporate includes corporate related expenses that are not allocated to the UTI or Concorde reportable segments. In prior years, these costs were allocated across our former Postsecondary Education reportable segment and Other category based upon compensation expense.\nAll of our campuses are institutionally accredited and are eligible for federal student financial assistance funds under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), commonly referred to as Title IV Programs, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Many of our programs also are eligible for financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.\nBusiness Model and Industry Partnerships\nWe serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. We continue to evolve our business model to provide our students with accessible, affordable training with a focus on bringing education to the students at convenient locations.\nMarket served by UTI\nThe market for qualified transportation or skilled trades technicians across the programs that UTI offers is large and growing. The United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (U.S. DOL BLS) estimates that an average of approximately 105,400 new job openings, due to growth and net replacements, will exist annually for newly trained technicians in the automotive, diesel, and collision fields through 2031. Additionally, for skilled trades and other transportation programs, the U.S. DOL BLS estimates that an average of 39,200 new jobs openings for industrial machinery mechanics, 42,600 new job openings for welders, 37,700 new job openings in the HVAC industry, 14,300 new job openings for computer-controlled machine tool operators, 12,800 new job openings for avionic technicians, 5,700 new job openings for robotics, 4,800 new job openings for marine and motorcycle technicians and 1,800 new job openings for wind turbine service technicians will exist annually for new entrants through 2032 in these fields.\nMarket served by Concorde\nThe market for qualified healthcare support occupations across the programs that Concorde offers is growing even faster, with the U.S. DOL BLS estimating an annual average of 1,211,000 new jobs annually through 2032. Specifically, the U.S. DOL BLS estimates that an average of 193,100 new job openings for registered nurses, 114,600 new job openings for medical assistants, 55,100 new job openings for dental assistants, 44,900 new job openings for pharmacy technicians, 32,900 new job openings for occupational therapy and physical therapist assistants and aides, 26,300 new job openings for diagnostic related technologists and technicians, 24,000 new job openings for clinical laboratory technologists and technicians, 22,000 new job openings for massage therapists and 19,500 new job openings for phlebotomists will exist annually for new entrants through 2032 in these fields.\nRecruitment\nOur student recruitment efforts begin with our commitment to positive outcomes, both for our students and our industry relationships. We use a multi-touch media approach across our admissions channels. For UTI, there are three primary admissions channels (high school, adult, and military) to enroll and start students, which involves national and local outreach to generate a high quality and quantity of prospective students. For Concorde, adults are the primary admissions channel, with an emphasis on those prospective adult students within the local proximity to a Concorde campus. To maximize the likelihood of student retention and graduation, our admissions process is intended to identify students who have the desire and ability to succeed in their chosen program. Prior to enrolling, many potential Concorde students complete a test which helps determine their expected success rate in a given program. In addition, we have established processes to identify students who may be in need of assistance to succeed in and complete their chosen program. To assist these students in graduating, we employ student service professionals that provide tutoring, and academic, financial, personal, and employment advisement. Additionally, as our campus locations do not offer housing for students, we have service professionals who leverage third-party relationships and assist our students in finding affordable housing near our campuses.\nIndustry Partnerships\nTo ensure the UTI programs provide students with the necessary hard and soft skills needed upon graduation, UTI has relationships with multiple original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and industry brand partners across the country to understand their needs for qualified service professionals. Through these industry relationships, UTI is able to continuously refine and expand its programs and curricula. We believe the UTI industry-focused educational model and national presence has enabled the UTI division to develop valuable industry relationships, which provide it with significant competitive advantages and supports its market leadership, along with enabling the division to provide highly specialized education to its students, resulting in enhanced employment opportunities and the potential for higher wages for its graduates.\nThe industry relationships for the UTI division also extend to thousands of local employers, after-market retailers, fleet service providers and enthusiast organizations. Other target groups for relationship-building, such as parts and tools suppliers, provide UTI with a variety of strategic and financial benefits that include equipment sponsorship, new product support, licensing and branding opportunities and financial sponsorship for the UTI campuses and students.\nConcorde partners with dental and medical offices, clinics, and hospitals to provide technical and professional skills through quality clinical experiences. These clinical externship experiences are embedded in the program coursework to provide hands-on, real-world healthcare experiences and connect students with potential employers. Concorde has relationships with thousands of clinical affiliate partners nationwide that provide robust and varied exposure to patient populations and healthcare models. Many of these clinical affiliate partners participate in program advisory councils and contribute to Concordes efforts to continuously improve its program curriculum and resources. These partnerships provide early employment and graduate employment opportunities and have resulted in customized curricula to assist in upskilling partners' employees.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy has three key tenets: to grow the business by more deeply penetrating existing target markets and adding new markets; to diversify the business by adding new locations, programs, and offerings that maximize the lifetime value of our students; and to continually optimize the business by constantly enhancing operational efficiency.\nCompany Growth, Diversification and Optimization\nOur organization has a number of key levers to grow, diversify, and optimize the business. Organically, we have been successful by adding new locations and new programs. In 2022, UTI launched new transportation & skilled trades campuses in Austin, Texas and Miramar, Florida, further expanding its geographical footprint and opening access to highly populated locations in growing economies. Inorganically, in November 2021, we acquired MIAT College of Technology which has served both as a growth strategy by adding two new locations and a diversification strategy by adding additional program areas in rapidly expanding skilled trades professions. This acquisition also has allowed us to extrapolate these in-demand programs from MIAT and imbue them into existing UTI campuses which increases the offerings and addressable markets at existing locations. Continually optimizing program offerings and operations serves to further enhance overall operating margins and is a foundational element of our strategy.\nIn December 2022, we continued to diversify by expanding into healthcare education through the acquisition of Concorde. This acquisition enabled us to expand our program offerings into the high-growth and high-demand healthcare education market. Integration of core functions across education groups allows us to continue to optimize from an operational perspective.\nReturn on Education\nWe provide an excellent return on our students education investment by working with corporate partners and local communities to offer educational programs that are tailored to professional and industry standards. With a high focus on offering programs for in-demand careers, our graduates are well prepared to enter or re-enter the workforce in high demand areas that offer well-paying jobs. We actively engage corporate partners in defining our program outcomes, program offerings, and ongoing educational requirements to ensure students have the requisite skills to succeed in the workplace of today and have a foundation for tomorrow. We regularly evaluate program offerings, schedules and locations that are most appealing to students and aligned with employer expectations. For our Concorde offerings, where appropriate, we ensure that our courses are aligned with licensure requirements to ensure our students are provided the greatest opportunity for success. Where appropriate, these professionally aligned programs enable our students to gain licensure, certification, and credentials in high-demand healthcare professions. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to better meet the markets demand for skilled technicians and healthcare workers.\nIn addition, we provide relevant services to assist students with possible tuition financing options, educational and career counseling, opportunities for part-time work while attending school, and ultimately graduate employment. Our career services teams develop job opportunities and outreach, advise active students on employment search and interviewing skills, facilitate employer visits to campuses, provide access to reference materials, assist with the composition of resumes, and help students prepare for applicable certification or licensure exams.\nShared Success Model\nOverall, our strategy and business model are built around the key principle of, If you succeed, we succeed. While operationally the Company has developed core competencies in marketing and enrollment management, the success of the business is not based solely on recruiting students, but rather retaining students through the program to graduation and facilitating their transition to employment in their field of study. Providing high-quality instruction in engaging curriculum aligned to industry and professional standards and delivering exemplary student support services to ensure students have everything they need to be successful serves as the foundation of our model. Retaining our students through to graduation and supporting them through to employment is the key principle of our business.\nUTI Schools and Programs\nUTI offers certificate, diploma or degree programs at campuses across the United States under the banner of several well-known brands. The majority of the UTI programs are designed to be completed in 30 to 100 weeks. The UTI advanced training programs range from 8 to 26 weeks in duration and are completed subsequent to satisfying the core UTI program requirements. These programs culminate in a certificate, diploma, associate of occupational studies degree, or associate of applied science degree depending on the program and campus. Tuition rates vary by type and length of our programs and the program level, such as core or advanced training.\nThe table below sets forth the current locations that operate under the UTI division, the year the campus opened, and the principal programs taught at each location.\nUTI Location Brand Year Campus Opened Current Principal Programs\nArizona (Avondale) UTI 1965 Airframe & Powerplant; Automotive; Diesel; Welding\nArizona (Avondale) MMI 1973 Motorcycle\nCalifornia (Long Beach) UTI 2015 Airframe & Powerplant; Automotive; Diesel; Collision Repair and Refinishing; Welding\nCalifornia (Rancho Cucamonga) UTI 1998 Automotive; Diesel; Industrial Maintenance; Robotics & Automation; Welding; Wind Power\nCalifornia (Sacramento) UTI 2005 Automotive; Diesel; Welding\nFlorida (Miramar) UTI 2022 Automotive; Diesel; Welding\nFlorida (Orlando) UTI/MMI 1986 Automotive; Diesel; Motorcycle; Marine\nIllinois (Lisle) UTI 1988 Automotive; Diesel; Industrial Maintenance; Robotics & Automation; Welding; Wind Power\nMichigan (Canton) MIAT 1969 Airframe and Powerplant; Aviation Maintenance; Energy; HVACR; Industrial Maintenance; Robotics & Automation; Wind Power; Welding\nNew Jersey (Bloomfield) UTI 2018 Automotive; Diesel; Welding\nNorth Carolina (Mooresville) NASCAR Tech 2002 Automotive; CNC Machining; HVACR; NASCAR; Robotics & Automation; Welding\nPennsylvania (Exton) UTI 2004 Automotive; Diesel; Robotics & Automation; Welding\nTexas (Austin) UTI 2022 Automotive; Diesel; HVACR; Welding\nTexas (Dallas/Ft.

During the year ended September 30, 2023, approximately 11% of Concordes active students received a Concorde-funded scholarship or grant and approximately 64% of Concorde active students received funding through Concorde sponsored retail installment contracts.\nStudent Enrollment\nUTI enrolls students throughout the year with courses typically starting every three to six weeks. Concorde enrolls students throughout the year with core terms starting every month and clinical terms starting every ten weeks. The table below outlines our new student starts, average undergraduate full-time students, and end of period undergraduate full-time students for both UTI and Concorde.\nYear Ended September 30, %\n2023 2022 Change\nUTI\nTotal new student starts 14,181 13,374 6.0 %\nAverage undergraduate full-time active students 12,614 12,838 (1.7) %\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time active students 14,833 14,380 3.2 %\nConcorde(1)\nTotal new student starts 8,432 - 100.0 %\nAverage undergraduate full-time active students 7,654 - 100.0 %\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time active students 8,369 - 100.0 %\nConsolidated\nTotal new student starts 22,613 13,374 69.1 %\nAverage undergraduate full-time active students 20,268 12,838 57.9 %\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time active students 23,202 14,380 61.3 %\n(1) Student data for Concorde presented in the year ended September 30, 2023 column represents the period of UTIs ownership, or December 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.\nDue to the seasonality of our business and normal fluctuations in student populations, we expect variability in our quarterly results. See \"Seasonality\" within Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating results.\nGraduate Employment\nIdentifying employment opportunities and preparing our graduates for their future careers is critical to our ability to deliver value to our graduates from their education. Additionally, we are required to meet certain graduate placement standards by location and program by both our national and programmatic accreditors. Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective career services team. Our campus-based staff facilitate several career development processes, including instruction and coaching for interview skills, interview etiquette and professionalism. Additionally, the career services team provides students with reference materials and assistance with the composition of resumes. Finally, we place emphasis on and devote significant time to assisting students with part-time and graduate job searches.\nWe also have centralized departments for each segment whose focus is to build and maintain relationships with potential and existing national employers and develop graduate job opportunities and, where possible, relocation assistance, sign-on bonuses, tool packages and tuition reimbursement plans with our manufacturer brand partners and other industry employers. Together, the campuses and centralized departments coordinate and host career fairs, industry awareness presentations, interview days and employer visits to our campus locations. We believe that our graduate career services provide our students with a compelling value proposition and enhance the employment opportunities for our graduates and are a competitive differentiator from other education institutions.\nCompetition\nThe for-profit, postsecondary education industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no one provider controlling significant market share. We compete with other institutions that are eligible to receive Title IV funding, including not-for-profit public and private schools, community colleges and for-profit institutions which offer programs similar to ours. Our competition differs in each market depending on the curriculum we offer and the availability of other choices, including job prospects. Other competitive factors that influence our ability to attract new students include the employment market, community colleges, other career-oriented and technical schools, and the military.\nProspective students may choose to forego additional education and enter the workforce directly, especially during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable as it has in recent years. This may include employment with our industry partners or with other manufacturers and employers of our graduates.\nWe compete with local community colleges for students seeking programs that are similar to ours, mainly due to local accessibility, low tuition rates and in certain cases free tuition. Public institutions are generally able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools. No single community college is a significant competitor; rather, the sector as a whole provides competition.\nWithin the for-profit education sector, some of our public company competitors are Adtalem Global Education, Inc., American Public Education, Inc., Lincoln Educational Services Corporation, Perdoceo Education Corporation, and Strategic Education, Inc. We also consider other regional or single location institutions with a larger local presence near one of our campuses to be competitors. Competition is generally based on location, tuition rates, the type of programs offered, the quality of instruction and instructional facilities, graduate employment rates, reputation and recruiting. Additionally, the military often recruits or retains potential students when branches of the military offer enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 3,000 full-time employees, including approximately 850 instructors, 550 admissions representatives, and 1,100 student support employees.\nEach of our employees plays a key role in our mission to serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) among our employees is essential in this process, as a truly innovative educational institution relies on a wealth of backgrounds and experiences to enhance student outcomes. We have a Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion who is responsible for setting the DE&I strategy and roadmap to ensure that we meet our objectives both internally, of creating a company where everyone feels they belong, and externally, by working closely with our marketing and talent acquisition functions to attract diverse talent. To attract a truly diverse workforce, we strive to instill a culture where employees are encouraged to draw upon their own unique skills and perspectives when engaging with our growing and diverse student population.\nFaculty members are hired nationally in accordance with established criteria, applicable accreditation standards and applicable state regulations. Members of our faculty are primarily industry professionals and are hired based on their prior work and educational experience. We require a specific level of industry experience in order to enhance the quality of the programs we offer and to address current and industry-specific issues in our course content. We provide intensive instructional training and continuing education to our faculty members to maintain the quality of instruction in all fields of study. A majority of our existing instructors have a minimum of five years experience in the industry and an average of seven years of experience teaching at UTI and four years of experience teaching at Concorde.\nWe employ field, military and campus-based admissions representatives who work directly with prospective students to facilitate the enrollment process. Additionally, each campus has a support team that typically includes a campus president, an education director, a financial aid director, a student services director, and a career services director.\nWe believe our corporate and divisional management teams have the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth and diversification strategy and continue to drive positive educational and employment outcomes for our students. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business\nOur failure to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for school operations could result in financial requirements or penalties, restrictions on our operations and loss of external financial aid funding.\nAs detailed in Business - Regulatory Environment, our institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by a wide range of federal and state agencies, as well as by our institutional accreditor. These requirements, which are subject to frequent change, cover virtually every aspect of our schools operations. The approvals granted by these entities permit our schools to operate and to participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs, including Title IV Programs, from which we derived approximately 67% of our revenues, on a cash basis, in fiscal year 2023. If our institutions fail to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, our regulators could take an array of actions, including, without limitation, issuing fines or penalties, requiring reimbursement for discharged loan obligations, requiring a letter of credit, halting certain business practices, or suspending or terminating our eligibility to participate the Title IV Programs. Any such adverse action could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, and could include the imposition of significant operating restrictions upon us. It could also result in negative publicity that could negatively affect student enrollment. We cannot predict with certainty how each regulatory body will apply its requirements or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future.\nFailure to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs could materially and adversely affect our business.\nTitle IV Program requirements, as described in Business - Regulatory Environment-Title IV Programs, are complex, at times imprecise, and subject to changing interpretations. In the event an institution violates these requirements, ED could impose sanctions or limitations, or terminate an institutions Title IV Program eligibility. Forms of noncompliance that could result in sanctions or limitations, or cause the institution to lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs, include, without limitation, failures to: maintain state authorizations; maintain institutional accreditations; satisfy EDs administrative capability standards; satisfy EDs loan default rate thresholds; correctly calculate and timely return unearned Title IV Program funds received for students who withdraw before completing their educational programs; correctly determine whether students are making satisfactory academic progress in their programs and, as such, remain eligible to receive Title IV Program funds; satisfy EDs financial responsibility standards; and comply with the 90/10 rule, the substantial misrepresentation rules or the incentive compensation rule. Certain actions or reviews may also be triggered automatically based on EDs standards. Types of sanctions or limitations ED might impose upon an institution include, without limitation: requiring the repayment of Title IV Program funds; imposing a less favorable payment system for the institutions receipt of Title IV Program funds; placing an institution on provisional certification status; commencing a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institutions participation in Title IV Programs; or declining to renew the institutions program participation agreement. Such sanctions or limitations, including the loss of Title IV Program eligibility by any of our current or future institutions, could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Failure to maintain state authorizations or institutional accreditation could also preclude participation in Title IV Programs. For more information, see Business - Regulatory Environment - Title IV Programs.\nCurrent and future Title IV Program regulations arising out of negotiated rulemakings could materially and adversely affect our business.\nED is almost continuously engaged in negotiated rulemakings, which is the process by which it revisits, revises, and expands the complex and voluminous Title IV Program regulations. These regulations also are frequently challenged through litigation, creating significant uncertainty as to when and what part of the regulations have taken effect, how they should be implemented, and how they will be interpreted and enforced. New Borrower Defense to Repayment or Gainful Employment regulations, in particular, may increase risks of financial liability or reputational harm. We devote significant effort to understanding the effects of these regulations on our business and to developing compliant solutions that also are congruent with our business, culture, and mission to serve our students and industry relationships. However, we cannot predict with certainty how these new and developing regulatory requirements will be applied or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future. Significant negotiated rulemakings that could materially and adversely affect our business are discussed in Business - Regulatory Environment - Title IV Program Rulemakings.\nThe loss of funds from Veterans' benefits programs could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs discussed in Business - Regulatory Environment - Other Federal and State Student Aid Programs, to participate in veterans benefits programs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the REAP, and VA Vocational Rehabilitation, our institutions must comply with certain requirements applicable to these programs. If we fail to comply with\nthese requirements, we could lose our eligibility to participate in veterans benefits programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Future legislative or regulatory initiatives that could negatively impact the funding we receive from veterans benefits programs include, without limitation: (i) proposals to restrict access to military installations for student recruitment; (ii) a reduction in appropriations for veterans benefits programs, or an extended government shutdown; (iii) an inability to secure approvals in one or more states, delays in the process for obtaining approvals, or the revocation of an approval; (iv) changes in the interpretation and application of the 85/15 rule, which prohibits paying VA benefits to students enrolling in a program where more than 85% of the students enrolled in that program have any portion of their tuition, fees, or other charges paid for them by the institution or the VA; and (v) changes in the interpretation and application of the VA rules governing the classification and treatment of blended coursework, and the eligibility of such coursework for veterans benefits programs.\nCongress may change the law or reduce funding for or place restrictions on the use of funds received through Title IV Programs, which could reduce our student population, revenues and/or profit margin.\nCongress periodically revises the HEA and other laws, and enacts new laws, governing Title IV Programs and determining the funding level for each Title IV Program. Congress most recently reauthorized the HEA in 2008. Despite repeated attempts, Congress has not completed a full reauthorization since then. In addition to HEA reauthorization, policies directly related to Title IV Programs and funding for those programs may be impacted by the annual budget and appropriations process as well as by other legislation. Additionally, a shutdown of government agencies, such as ED, responsible for administering student financial aid programs under Title IV could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in origination and disbursement of government-funded student loans to our students. Any action by Congress that significantly affects Title IV Programs or the ability of our schools or students to receive funding through these programs or places restrictions on the use of funds received by an institution through these programs could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Such action may occur during HEA reauthorization as part of separate technical amendments to the HEA or during Congress annual budget and appropriations cycle. These uncertainties could reduce our student population, revenues and/or profit margin.\nContinued or increased examination of the for-profit education sector could result in further legislation, appropriations, regulations, and enforcement actions that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOver the last decade, Congress and state legislatures have focused significantly on for-profit education institutions, specifically regarding participation in Title IV Programs and DOD oversight of tuition assistance for military service members attending for-profit colleges. Continued or increased Congressional activity could result in the enactment of more stringent legislation, further rulemakings affecting participation in Title IV Programs and other governmental actions, increasing regulation of the for-profit sector. In addition, concerns generated by this activity may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions such as ours. Any laws that are adopted that limit our or our students participation in Title IV Programs or in programs to provide funds for active duty service members and veterans or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible, or any decreases in enrollment related to the Congressional activity concerning this sector, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we experience a disruption in our ability to process student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program.\nBecause all Title IV Program student loans (other than Perkins loans) are now processed under the Direct Loan (DL) program, any disruption in our ability to process student loans through the DL program, either because of administrative challenges on our part or the inability of ED to process the increased volume of loans through the DL program on a timely basis, could impact our students ability to timely obtain their student loans and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties alleging noncompliance with applicable standards. Each of our institutions administration of Title IV Program funds must be audited annually by independent accountants and the resulting audit report must be submitted to ED for review. Moreover, we may be subject to program reviews from ED or a compliance audit as a condition of participation in the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). We are also subject to various lawsuits, investigations and claims, covering a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, alleged violations\nof federal and state laws, including consumer protection laws applicable to activities of postsecondary educational institutions, false claims made to the federal government and routine employment matters. We may also face borrower defense to repayment claims or complaints from students or prospective students. While we are committed to strict compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and accrediting standards, if the results of government, regulatory or third party reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to successfully defend against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages, be held liable for a students discharged debt, or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of regulatory approvals or Title IV Program funding or other federal and state funding, injunctions or other penalties. We could also incur substantial legal costs that are not covered or are in excess of our insurance coverage. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or defend those lawsuits or claims. Additionally, given the significant public scrutiny being placed on the sector we operate in, numerous state attorneys general have initiated investigations of for-profit schools operating in their state. Changes occurring at the federal or state level, as well as our financial performance in recent years, may spur further action or additional reporting requirements by state attorneys general, Congressional leadership or state licensing bodies.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of unsettled matters, and we may incur significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with them in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters. We may be required to pay substantial damages, settlement costs or fines or penalties. Such costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition and could also result in negative publicity that could negatively affect student enrollment. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our licenses, accreditation and eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nOur business and stock price could be adversely affected as a result of regulatory investigations of, or actions commenced against, us or other companies in our industry.\nThe operations of companies in the education and training services industry, including us, are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. In some cases, allegations of wrongdoing on the part of such companies have resulted in formal or informal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, the FTC, state governmental agencies and attorneys general, ED and other federal agencies. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of legislative hearings and regulatory actions at both the federal and state levels, focusing not only on the individual schools but in some cases on the for-profit postsecondary education sector as a whole. These investigations of, or regulatory actions against, specific companies in the education and training services industry could have a negative impact on our industry as a whole and on our stock price. Furthermore, the outcome of such investigations and any accompanying adverse publicity could negatively affect student enrollment and heighten the risk of class action lawsuits against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in the state regulatory environment, state and agency budget constraints and increased regulatory requirements, may affect our ability to obtain and maintain necessary authorizations or approvals from those states to conduct or change our operations.\nDue to state budget constraints and changes in the regulatory environment in some of the states in which we operate, it is possible that some states may reduce the number of employees in, or curtail the operations of, the state education agencies that authorize our schools. A delay or refusal by any state education agency in approving any changes in our operations that require state approval, such as the opening of a new campus, the introduction of new programs or the revision of existing programs, a change of control or the hiring or placement of new admissions representatives, could prevent us from making such changes or delay our ability to make such changes, or could require substantial additional costs to accommodate such delay.\nState education agencies that authorize our schools continue to revise or issue new regulations requiring significant additional reporting and monitoring of student outcomes. Additionally, state education agencies may request additional information or supplemental reporting as a result of our recent financial performance. The regulations and reporting requirements may lengthen the time to obtain necessary state approvals and require us to modify our operations in order to comply with the requirements. This could impose substantial additional costs on our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nState legislatures also continue to contemplate creating new performance metrics that would have to be satisfied to maintain eligibility. The enactment of one or more of these proposed laws or similar laws could create compliance challenges and\nimpose substantial additional costs on our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nBudget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students, which could reduce our student population and negatively affect our 90/10 Rule calculation and other compliance metrics.\nSome states are facing budget constraints that are causing them to reduce state appropriations in a number of areas including financial aid provided to students that may attend one of our programs. We cannot predict how significant any of these reductions will be or how long they will last. If the level of state funding available to our students decreases and our students are not able to secure alternative sources of funding, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition, negatively impact our cohort default rates, or impact our performance under the federal 90/10 Rule calculation.\nIf we acquire an institution that participates in Title IV Programs or open an additional location, one or more of our regulators could decline to approve the acquired institution or additional location, or could impose material conditions or restrictions, which could impair our ability to operate the acquired institution and/or the additional location as planned or to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of that institution and/or opening of the additional location.\nIf we acquire an institution that participates in Title IV Program funding or open an additional location, we must obtain approval from ED and applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions in order for the institution or additional location to be able to operate and participate in Title IV Programs. An acquisition can result in the temporary suspension of the acquired institutions participation in Title IV Programs and opening an additional location can result in a delay of the campus participation in Title IV Programs unless we submit a timely and materially complete application for approval of the acquisition or the opening of the new location. If we were unable to timely establish or re-establish the state authorization, accreditation or ED certification of the acquired institution or obtain approval for the new location, our ability to operate the acquired institution or open the additional location as planned or to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of that institution or the opening of the additional location could be significantly impaired.\nFurther, ED and applicable state education agencies and accrediting agencies could impose material conditions or restrictions on us and the acquired institution or the additional location, including, but not limited to, a material letter of credit, limitations or prohibitions on the ability to add new campuses or add or change educational programs, placement of the institution on the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement method of payment and reporting and notification requirements. Additionally, an acquired institution may have known or unknown instances of noncompliance with federal, state or accrediting agency requirements, including, but not limited to, noncompliance with requirements included in the borrower defense to repayment regulations that could result in liabilities, sanctions, or material conditions or restrictions that we may inherit by acquiring the institution. Further, our due diligence efforts relating to institutions that we intend to acquire may be unsuccessful and fail to identify noncompliance or other facts that could result in liabilities, sanctions, or material conditions or restrictions. The imposition of liabilities, sanctions, or material conditions or restrictions by one or more regulators could impair our ability to operate the acquired institution or open the additional location as planned or to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of that institution or the opening of the additional location.\nIf regulators do not approve additional or revised programs, it could have an adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives.\nA student may only use Title IV Program funds to pay the costs associated with enrollment in an eligible educational program offered by an institution participating in Title IV Programs. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to add new educational programs at our existing institutions. Generally, an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, and is not provisionally certified, may obtain ED approval if the new program is licensed by the applicable state agency and accredited by an agency recognized by ED. However, ED, or state education agencies, and our accreditors could decline to approve a new program or impose material conditions or restrictions on us. Any such denial or material limitation could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company or any of our schools, our ability to participate in Title IV Programs may be impaired.\nIf we or any of our schools experience a change of control under the standards of applicable federal and state agencies, our accrediting commissions or ED, we or the affected schools must seek the approval of the relevant regulatory agencies. These agencies do not have uniform criteria for what constitutes a change of control. Transactions or events that constitute a change\nof control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of our common stock or significant changes in the composition of our board of directors. Some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from ED, our accrediting commission or any state in which our schools are located would impair our ability to participate in Title IV Programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, approval of any change of control from any state in which we do not have a school but in which we recruit students could require us to suspend our recruitment of students in that state until we receive the required approval. The potential adverse effects of a change of control with respect to participation in Title IV Programs could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock.\nIf our vendors do not comply with Title IV Program regulations, our business could be harmed and our ability to participate in Title IV Programs may be impaired.\nThe failure of any of our vendors charged with administering any aspect of our participation in the Title IV Programs could lead to fines and the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. Such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFailure to comply with private education loan requirements may impair out business.\nConcorde offers students the opportunity to finance all or part of their education using institutional credit, including retail installment contracts. If such arrangements qualify as a private education loan under federal law, a multitude of regulations must be followed, including from ED and the CFPB. State attorneys general and other regulators also scrutinize such arrangements. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, and could also result in negative publicity that could negatively affect student enrollment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nFailure to execute on our growth and diversification strategy.\nAs part of our business strategy, we anticipate opening and operating new schools or campuses. Establishing new schools or campuses poses unique challenges and requires us to make investments in management and capital expenditures, incur marketing expenses and devote other resources that are different, and in some cases greater, than those required with respect to the operation of acquired schools. Accordingly, when we open new schools, initial investments could reduce our profitability. To open a new school or campus, we would be required to obtain appropriate state and accrediting commission approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. Additionally, to be eligible for Title IV Program funding, a new school or campus would have to be certified by ED. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify suitable expansion opportunities to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate or that we will be able to successfully integrate or profitably operate any new schools or campuses. Our failure to effectively identify, establish, license, accredit, obtain necessary approvals and manage the operations of newly established schools or campuses could slow our growth and make any newly established schools or campuses more costly to operate than we have historically experienced.\nWe may be unable to successfully complete or integrate future acquisitions.\nWe may consider selective acquisitions in the future. We may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or, even if we do, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our business. Integration challenges include, among others, regulatory approvals, significant capital expenditures, assumption of known and unknown liabilities, our ability to control costs and our ability to integrate new personnel. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the senior management of the acquired schools, which could decrease the time that they devote to the day-to-day management of our business. If we do not successfully address risks and challenges associated with acquisitions, including integration, future acquisitions could harm, rather than enhance, our operating performance. Additionally, if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. A future acquisition could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses, goodwill and other intangible assets, charges relating to integration costs or an increase in the number of shares outstanding. In addition, our acquisition of a school is a change of ownership of that school, which may result in the temporary suspension of that schools participation in federal student financial aid programs until it obtains EDs approval. These results could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition or result in dilution to current stockholders.\nIf we fail to reduce our underutilized capacity, we may experience a deterioration of our profitability and operating margins.\nWe have underutilized capacity at a number of our campuses. Our ongoing efforts to increase utilization may strain our management, operations, employees or other resources. We may not be able to maintain our current capacity utilization rates, effectively manage our operations or achieve planned capacity utilization on a timely or profitable basis. If we are unable to improve our underutilized capacity, we may experience operating inefficiencies at a level that would result in higher than anticipated costs, which would adversely affect our profitability and operating margins.\nMacroeconomic conditions and aversion to debt could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our enrollment, which tends to be counter cyclical, is affected by changes in economic conditions. During periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable, prospective students have more employment options and recruiting new students has traditionally been more challenging. In addition, affordability concerns associated with increased living expenses, relocation expenses and the availability of full- and part-time jobs for students attending classes have made it more challenging for us to attract and retain students.\nConversely, an increase in the unemployment rate and weaker macroeconomic conditions could reduce the willingness of employers to sponsor educational opportunities for their employees and affect the ability of our students to find employment in the industries that we serve, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse market conditions for consumer and federally guaranteed student loans could negatively impact the ability of borrowers with little or poor credit history, such as many of our students, to borrow the necessary funds at an acceptable interest rate. These events could adversely affect the ability or willingness of our former students to repay student loans, which could increase our student loan cohort default rate and require increased time, attention and resources to manage these defaults.\nFailure on our part to maintain and expand existing industry relationships and develop new industry relationships with our industry customers could impair our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe have extensive industry relationships that we believe afford us significant competitive strength and support our market leadership. These relationships enable us to support enrollment in our core programs by attracting students through brand name recognition and the associated prospect of high-quality employment opportunities. Additionally, these relationships allow us to diversify funding sources, expand the scope and increase the number of programs we offer and reduce our costs and capital expenditures due to the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the underlying contracts with manufacturer brand partners, we provide a variety of specialized training programs and typically do so using tools, equipment and vehicles provided by the manufacturer brand partners. These relationships also provide additional incremental revenue opportunities from training the employees of our industry customers. Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand our existing industry relationships and to enter into new industry relationships. Certain of our UTI segments existing industry relationships, including those with American Honda Motor Company, Inc.; Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick Corporation; Volvo Penta of the Americas, Inc. and Yamaha Motor Corporation, USA, are not memorialized in writing and are based on verbal understandings. As a result, the rights of the parties under these arrangements are less clearly defined than they would be had they been in writing. Additionally, certain of our written agreements may be terminated without cause by the OEM. Finally, certain of our existing industry relationship agreements expire within the next six months. We are currently negotiating to renew these agreements and intend to renew them to the extent we can do so on satisfactory terms. The reduction or elimination of, or failure to renew any of our existing industry relationships, or our failure to enter into new industry relationships, could impair our ability to attract and retain students, require additional capital expenditures or increase expenses and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop and integrate new programs in a cost-effective manner and on a timely basis.\nProspective employers of our graduates demand that their entry-level employees possess appropriate technological skills. These skills are becoming more sophisticated in line with technological advancements in the transportation, skilled trades, energy and healthcare industries Accordingly, educational programs at our schools must keep pace with those technological advancements. Additionally, the method used to deliver curriculum has evolved to include online delivery. The updates to our existing programs and the development of new programs, and changes in the method in which we deliver them, may not be accepted by our students, prospective employers or the technical education market. Even if we are able to develop acceptable\nnew programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as the industries we serve require or as quickly as our competitors. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our graduate employment rates could suffer.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to address and respond to requirements for new or updated curricula such as training instructors to teach the curricula, obtaining the appropriate equipment to teach the curricula to our students, or obtaining the appropriate regulatory approvals, we may not be able to successfully roll out the curricula to our campuses in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are not able to effectively and efficiently integrate curricula, this could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the experience, skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers. Our success also depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty, campus presidents, administrators and corporate management. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in the attraction and retention of personnel who possess the skill sets that we seek. The for-profit education sector can experience periods of significant regulatory and government scrutiny, which may make it more difficult to attract and retain talent. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us. Because we do not currently carry key man life insurance, the loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could impair our ability to successfully manage our business.\nWe are party to debt arrangements that contain restrictive covenants, and if we are unable to comply with these covenants then the lenders could declare an event of default wherein we may need to immediately repay the amounts due under the respective debt arrangements.\nOur term loans and revolving credit facility impose various restrictions and contain customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, without limitation, certain reporting obligations and certain limitations on restricted payments; and limitations on liens, encumbrances and indebtedness. If we fail to comply with the covenants or payments specified in the agreements, the lenders could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. The amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our operations and liquidity, including by, among other things: (i) making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions, because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; (ii) causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flows to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other business activities; (iii) making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and (iv) limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund the activities and expenditures described above and for other general corporate purposes as and when needed, which could force us to suspend, delay or curtail business prospects, strategies or operations.\nCompetition could decrease our market share and create tuition pricing concerns.\nThe postsecondary education market is highly competitive. We continue to experience a high level of competition for higher quality students not only from similar programs, but also from the overall employment market and the military. Some traditional public and private colleges, universities and community colleges, as well as other private career-oriented schools, offer programs that may be perceived by students to be similar to ours. We compete with local community colleges for students seeking programs that are similar to ours, mainly due to local accessibility, low tuition rates and in certain cases free tuition. Most public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools.\nProspective students may choose to forego additional education and enter the workforce directly, especially during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable as it has in recent years. This may include employment with our industry partners or with other manufacturers and employers of our graduates. Additionally, the military often recruits or retains potential students when branches of the military offer enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses.\nWe may limit tuition increases or increase spending in response to competition in order to retain or attract students or pursue new market opportunities; however, if we cannot effectively respond to competitor changes, it could reduce our enrollments and our student populations. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not adversely affect our market share, revenues and operating margin.\nOur financial performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop awareness and acceptance of our programs among high school graduates, military personnel and adults seeking advanced training.\nThe awareness of our programs among high school graduates, military personnel and working adults seeking advanced training is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of our programs. Factors that could impact our ability to increase such awareness include: continued school district limitations on access to students by for-profit institutions; actions that would limit our access to military bases and installations; and our failure to maintain relationships with automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine manufacturers and suppliers, as well as hospitals, long-term care facilities and medical and dental offices. Our inability to continue to develop awareness of our programs could reduce our enrollments, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpanding our blended learning format could be difficult for us.\nThe expansion of existing and creation of new blended programs may not be accepted by students or employers. Our efforts may be materially adversely affected by increased competition in the online or blended education market, or because of performance or reliability issues with our blended program infrastructure.\nWe are heavily dependent on the reliability and performance of an internally developed student management and reporting system, and any difficulties in maintaining this system may result in service interruptions, decreased customer service or increased expenditures.\nThe software that underlies our student management and reporting for our UTI schools has been developed primarily by our own employees. The reliability and continuous availability of this internal system and related integrations are critical to our business. Any interruptions that hinder our ability to timely deliver our services, or that materially impact the efficiency or cost with which we provide these services, or our ability to attract and retain computer programmers with knowledge of the appropriate computer programming language, would adversely affect our reputation and profitability and our ability to conduct business and prepare financial reports.\nSystem disruptions and security threats to our computer networks, including breach of the personal information we collect, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nOur computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to interruption, malfunction or damage due to events beyond our control, including malicious human acts committed by foreign or domestic persons, natural disasters, and network and communications failures. We have established a written data breach incident response policy, which we test informally and formally at least annually. Additionally, we periodically perform vulnerability self-assessments and engage service providers to perform independent vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. However, despite network security measures, our servers and the servers at our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. Increasing socioeconomic and political instability in some countries has heightened these risks. Despite the precautions we and our service providers have taken, our systems may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations.\nAdditionally, the personal information that we collect subjects us to additional risks and costs that could harm our business and our reputation. We collect, retain and use personal information regarding our students and their families and our employees, including personally identifiable information, tax return information, financial data, bank account information and other data. Although we employ various network and business security measures to limit access to and use of such personal information, we cannot guarantee that a third party will not circumvent such security measures, resulting in the breach, loss or theft of the personal information of our students and their families and our employees. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could restrict our use of personal information and require notification of data breaches. A violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection, retention or use of personal information could also result in the imposition of fines or lawsuits against us.\nSustained or repeated system failures or security breaches that interrupt our ability to process information in a timely manner or that result in a breach of proprietary or personal information could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, available insurance proceeds may not be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nOur success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs in recruiting new students.\nIn order to maintain and increase our revenues and margins, we must continue to develop our admissions programs and attract new students in a cost-effective manner. The level of marketing and advertising and types of strategies used are affected by the specific geographic markets, regulatory compliance requirements and the specific individual nature of each institution and its students. The complexity of these marketing efforts contributes to their cost. If we are unable to advertise and market our institutions and programs successfully, our ability to attract and enroll new students could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We use marketing tools such as the Internet, radio, television and print media advertising to promote our institutions and programs. Our representatives also make presentations at high schools and career fairs. Additionally, we rely on the general reputation of our institutions and referrals from current students, alumni and employers as a source of new enrollment. As part of our marketing and advertising, we also subscribe to lead-generating databases in certain markets, the cost of which may increase. Among the factors that could prevent us from marketing and advertising our institutions and programs successfully are the failure of our marketing tools and strategies to appeal to prospective students, regulatory constraints on marketing, current student and/or employer dissatisfaction with our program offerings or results and diminished access to high school campuses and military bases. In order to maintain our growth, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and increase our addressable market by adding locations in new markets and rolling out new academic programs. Any failure to accomplish this may have a material adverse effect on our future growth.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain and continue to develop and train our admissions representatives, the effectiveness of our student recruiting efforts would be adversely affected.\nIn order to support revenue growth and student enrollment, we need to hire and train new admissions representatives, as well as retain and continue to develop our existing admissions representatives, who are our employees dedicated to student recruitment. Our ability to develop a strong admissions representative team may be affected by a number of factors, including: competition in hiring qualified persons; limitations on compensation payable to admissions representatives arising from the incentive compensation rule; and our ability to adequately train and motivate our admissions representatives. If we are unable to hire, develop or retain quality admissions representatives, the effectiveness of our student recruiting efforts would be adversely affected.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nOur revolving credit facility and a portion of our term loans bear interest at variable rates. For our term loans, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with the lenders at the time of inception that effectively fix the interest rates on 50% of the principal amount of the loan. However, increases in interest rates with respect to any amount of our debt not covered by the interest rate swaps could increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and cash flows. Such increases may occur from changes in regulatory standards or industry practices.\nRestrictions on, the inability to offer, or degraded collection performance for our proprietary loan program could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nThe proprietary loan program offered by the UTI and MMI brand schools enables students who have utilized all available government-sponsored or other financial aid and have not been successful in obtaining private loans from other financial institutions, for independent students, or PLUS loans, for dependent students, to borrow a portion of their tuition if they meet certain criteria.\nUnder the proprietary loan program, the bank originates loans for our students who meet specific credit criteria with the related proceeds to be used exclusively to fund a portion of their tuition. We then purchase all such loans from the bank at least monthly and assume all the related credit and collection risk. See Note 2 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of activity under the proprietary loan program.\nFactors that may impact our ability to collect these loans include the following, without limitation: current economic conditions; compliance with laws applicable to the origination, servicing and collection of loans; the quality of our loan servicers performance; and a decline in graduate employment opportunities and the priority that the borrowers under this loan program attach to repaying these loans as compared to other obligations, particularly students who did not complete or were dissatisfied with their programs of study.\nThe portion of a student's tuition revenue related to the proprietary loan program is considered a form of variable consideration. We estimate the amount we ultimately expect to collect from the portion of tuition that is funded by the proprietary loan program, resulting in a note receivable. The estimated amount is determined at the inception of the contract, and we recognize the related revenue as the student progresses through school. Each reporting period, we update our assessment of the variable consideration associated with the proprietary loan program. Estimating the collection rate requires significant management judgment. If we are unable to accurately assess the variable consideration, our revenues and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nFederal, state and local laws and general legal and equitable principles relating to the protection of consumers can apply to the origination, servicing and collection of the loans under the proprietary loan program. Any violation of various federal, state or local laws, including, in some instances, violations of these laws by parties not under our control, may result in losses on the loans or may limit our ability to collect all or part of the principal or interest on the loans. This may be the case even if we are not directly responsible for the violations by such parties.\nThe proprietary loan program may also be subject to oversight by the CFPB, which could result in additional reporting requirements or increased scrutiny. Other proprietary postsecondary institutions have been subject to information requests from the CFPB with regard to their private student loan programs. The possibility of litigation, and the associated cost, are risks associated with the proprietary loan program. At least two proprietary education institutions have been subject to lawsuits under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010; the institutions are accused of having unfair private student loan programs and of allegedly engaging in certain abusive practices, including interfering with students' ability to understand their debt obligations and failing to provide certain material information.\nChanges in laws or public policy could negatively impact the viability of the proprietary loan program and cause us to delay or suspend the program. Additionally, depending on the terms of the loans, state consumer credit regulators may assert that our activities in connection with the proprietary loan program require us to obtain one or more licenses, registrations or other forms of regulatory approvals, any of which may not be able to be obtained in a timely manner, if at all. All of these factors could result in the proprietary loan program having a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to originate, process and service loans under our proprietary loan program. If these companies fail or discontinue providing such services, our business could be harmed.\nA state chartered bank with a small market capitalization originates loans under the proprietary loan program for the UTI and MMI brand schools. If the bank no longer provides service under the contract, we do not currently have an alternative bank to fulfill the demand. There are a limited number of banks that are willing to participate in a program such as the proprietary loan program. The time it could take us to replace the bank could result in an interruption in the loan origination process, which could result in a decrease in our student populations. Furthermore, a single company processes loan applications and services the loans under the proprietary loan program. There is a 90-day termination clause in the contract under which they provide these services. If this company were to terminate the contract, we could experience an interruption in loan application processing or loan servicing, which could result in a decrease in our student populations.\nWe have goodwill, which may become impaired and subject to a write-down.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, which might result from the deterioration in the operating performance of acquired businesses, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. Any resulting impairment charge is recognized as an expense in the period in which impairment is identified. Our total recorded goodwill was $28.5 million as of September 30, 2023 resulted from our MMI, MIAT and Concorde acquisitions. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of August 1 of each fiscal year. Future assessments of goodwill could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income and operating income resulting from the write-down or impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial results. If economic or industry\nconditions deteriorate or if market valuations decline, including with respect to our common stock, we may be required to impair goodwill in future periods.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made catastrophes, including those caused by climate change and other climate-related causes, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business and operations could be materially adversely affected in the event of earthquakes, hurricanes, severe storms, blackouts or other power losses, floods, fires, telecommunications failures, break-ins, acts of terrorism, public health crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, other inclement weather or similar events.\nWe teach our UTI, MMI and Concorde programs at campus locations in Jacksonville, Orlando, Miramar, and Tampa, Florida, all areas that can experience tropical storms and hurricanes, severe storms, floods, coastal storms, tornadoes and power outages. We also have seven campus locations in California and seven campus locations in Texas, all in areas that have historically been susceptible to severe weather events.\nIf floods, fire, inclement weather, including extreme rain, wind, heat, or cold, or accidents due to human error were to occur and cause damage to our campus facilities, or limit the ability of our students or faculty to participate in or contribute to our academic programs or our ability to comply with federal and state educational requirements or our agreements with our vendors, our business may be adversely effected, especially if such events were to occur in the midst of ongoing academic programs during an academic cycle. Such disruptions may also result in increases in student attrition, voluntary or mandatory closure of some or all of our facilities, or our inability to procure essential supplies or travel during the pendency of mandated travel restrictions. We may not be able to effectively shift our operations due to disruptions arising from the occurrence of such events, and our business and results of operations could be affected adversely as a result. Moreover, damage to or total destruction of our campus facilities from various weather events may not be covered in whole or in part by any insurance we may have.\nPublic health pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally. The extent to which a similar pandemic may impact our business and operations will depend on a variety of factors beyond our control, including the actions of governments, businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic, the effectiveness of those actions, and vaccine availability, distribution and adoption, all of which cannot be predicted with any level of certainty.\nRisks Related to Investing in Our Common Stock\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock own a significant percentage of our capital stock, are able to influence and control certain corporate matters and could in the future substantially dilute the ownership interest of holders of our common stock.\nOn June 24, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold 700,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Coliseum Holdings I, LLC (Coliseum Holdings), and filed a Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.\nIf fully converted, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into 20,296,847 shares of common stock. Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock and any other class or series similarly entitled to vote with the holders of common stock and not as a separate class, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the holders of common stock, on an as converted basis. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible to common stock at any time at the option of the holder, subject to the Continuing Caps. See Note 18 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Continuing Caps.\nAny conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We have granted Coliseum Holdings and certain recipients of Series A Preferred Stock in the Distributions registration rights in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof. These registration rights could facilitate the resale of such securities into the\npublic market, and any resale of these securities would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, a majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock must approve certain significant corporate actions, such as (i) amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws in a manner adverse to the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) the creation or issuance of a series of stock, or other security convertible into a series of stock, with equal or greater rights than those of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, (iii) the issuance of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, at a price that is 25% below fair market value at the time of issuance, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness, (v) subject to certain exceptions, the sale or licensing of any of our material assets, (vi) subject to certain exceptions, the consummation of acquisitions (of stock or assets), (vii) subject to certain exceptions, the payment of certain dividends or distributions with respect to a series of stock junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, (viii) the voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of UTI if the Series A Preferred Stock would not have the option to receive the liquidation preference then in effect upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or (ix) subject to certain exceptions, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification or other transaction in which substantially all of our common stock is exchanged or converted into cash, securities or property and in which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have the option to receive the full liquidation preference as a result of that transaction.\nThe interests of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders and Coliseum Holdings concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of UTI otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation, developments in our industry; our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry; negative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business; changes in enrollment; and changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from health epidemics, war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn reviewing our results of operations, you should not focus on quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year. Our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in total student population. Student population varies as a result of new student enrollments, graduations and student attrition. Historically, our schools have had lower student populations in our third fiscal quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. Our expenses, however, do not generally vary at the same rate as changes in our student population and revenues and, as a result, such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. We expect quarterly fluctuations in results of operations to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. Such patterns may change, however, as a result of acquisitions, new school openings, new program introductions and increased enrollments of adult students. Additionally, our revenues for our first fiscal quarter are adversely affected by the fact that we do not recognize revenue during the calendar year-end holiday break, which falls primarily in that quarter. These fluctuations may result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2.

In July, we vacated our previous office location in Kansas City, Missouri. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn the ordinary conduct of our business, we are periodically subject to lawsuits, demands in arbitrations, investigations, regulatory proceedings or other claims, including, but not limited to, claims involving current and former students, routine employment matters, business disputes and regulatory demands. When we are aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we would accrue a liability for the loss. When a loss is not both probable and estimable, we do not accrue a liability. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible, including if a loss in excess of an accrued liability is reasonably possible, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim. Because we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings (including lawsuits, investigations, regulatory proceedings or claims) asserted against us, it is not currently possible to provide such an estimate. The ultimate outcome of pending legal proceedings to which we are a party may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNone.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol UTI.\nThe closing price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE on November 28, 2023 was $11.62 per share. As of November 28, 2023, there were 14 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nOn June 9, 2016, our board of directors voted to eliminate the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. Any future common stock dividends require the approval of a majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe continuously evaluate our cash position in light of growth opportunities, operating results and general market conditions.\nRepurchase of Securities\nOn December 10, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan that would allow for the repurchase of up to $35.0 million of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This new share repurchase plan replaced the previously authorized plan from fiscal 2012. Any repurchases under this new stock repurchase program require the approval of a majority of the voting power of our Series A Preferred Stock. We did not repurchase any shares during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following Stock Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or filed with the SEC, nor should such information be incorporated by reference into any future filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference in such filing.\nThe graph below compares our annual percentage change in cumulative total return on common shares over the past five years with the cumulative total return of companies comprising the Russell 2000 Index and our peer group index.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion together with the \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those we discuss under Risk Factors Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nUniversal Technical Institute, Inc., which together with its subsidiaries is referred to as the Company, we, us or our, was founded in 1965 and is a leading workforce solutions provider of transportation, skilled trades and healthcare education programs, whose mission is to serve students, partners, and communities by providing quality education and support services for in-demand careers across a number of highly-skilled fields. We offer the majority of our programs in a blended learning model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs.\nConcord Career Colleges Acquisition\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition contemplated by the previously announced Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement), dated May 3, 2022, by and among the Company, Concorde Career Colleges, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Concorde); Liberty Partners Holdings 28, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, and Liberty Investment IIC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (each a Seller, and collectively, the Sellers); and Liberty Partners L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, in its capacity as a representative of the Sellers. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we acquired of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Concorde for a base purchase price of $50.0 million, less $1.9 million in net adjustments including the post-closing working capital adjustment, for total cash consideration paid of $48.1 million. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for a discussion on the financing used to fund the acquisition. See Note 4 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the acquisition.\nIn conjunction with the Concorde acquisition on December 1, 2022, we redefined our reporting structure into two reportable segments as follows:\nUniversal Technical Institute (UTI): UTI operates 16 campuses located in nine states and offers a wide range of degree and non-degree transportation and skilled trades technical training programs under brands such as Universal Technical Institute, Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, Marine Mechanics Institute, NASCAR Technical Institute, and MIAT College of Technology (MIAT). UTI also offers manufacturer specific advanced training programs (MSAT), which include student-paid electives, at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at certain campuses and dedicated training centers. Lastly, UTI provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers. UTI works closely with multiple original equipment manufacturers and industry brand partners to understand their needs for qualified service professionals.\nConcorde Career Colleges (Concorde): Concorde operates 17 campuses located in eight states and online, offering degree, non-degree, and continuing education programs in the allied health, dental, nursing, patient care and diagnostic fields. The Company has designated campuses that offer degree granting programs Concorde Career College; where allowed by State regulation. The remaining campuses are designated as Concorde Career Institute. Concorde believes in preparing students for their healthcare careers with practical, hands-on experiences including opportunities to learn while providing care to real patients. Prior to graduation, students will complete a number of hours in a clinical setting or externship, depending upon their program of study.\nCorporate includes corporate related expenses that are not allocated to the UTI or Concorde reportable segments. In prior years, these costs were allocated across our former Postsecondary Education reportable segment and Other category based upon compensation expense. See Note 22 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on our segments.\nAll of our campuses are accredited and are eligible for federal student financial assistance funds under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, commonly referred to as Title IV Programs, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Our programs are also eligible for financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.\nWe believe that our industry-focused educational model and national presence has enabled us to develop valuable industry relationships, which provide us with significant competitive advantages and supports our market leadership, and enables us to provide highly specialized education to our students, resulting in enhanced employment opportunities and the potential for higher wages for our graduates.\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for discounts and scholarships that we sponsor and for refunds to students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates. Tuition and fee revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the course or program offered. Approximately 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consisted of gross tuition. We supplement our tuition and fee revenues with additional revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies and other revenues, which are recognized as the transfer of goods or services occurs. Tuition revenue and fees generally vary based on the average number of students enrolled and average tuition charged per program.\nFor students at our UTI and MMI branded schools, we offer a proprietary loan program, where we provide the students who participate in this program with extended payment terms for a portion of their tuition for up to ten years. UTI also provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers where revenue is recognized as the transfer of services occurs.\nStudent Enrollment and Tuition\nAverage full-time enrollments vary depending on, among other factors, the number of continuing students at the beginning of a period, new student enrollments during the period, students who have previously withdrawn but decide to re-enroll during the period, and graduations and withdrawals during the period. Our average full-time enrollments are influenced by the:\nAttractiveness of our program offerings to high school graduates and potential adult students;\nEffectiveness of our marketing efforts;\nDepth of our industry relationships;\nStrength of employment markets and long-term career prospects;\nQuality of our instructors and student services professionals;\nPersistence of our students;\nLength of our education programs;\nAvailability of federal and alternative funding for our programs; and\nNumber of graduates of our programs who elect to attend the advanced training programs we offer and general economic conditions.\nThe introduction of additional program offerings at existing campuses and the opening of additional campuses is expected to influence our average full-time enrollment. UTI currently offers start dates at its campuses that range from every three to nine weeks throughout the year in the core programs. The number of start dates of UTI advanced training programs varies by the duration of those programs and the needs of the manufacturers that sponsor them. Concorde enrolls students throughout the year with core terms starting every month and clinical terms starting every ten weeks. Although Concorde operates year-round with lower seasonality than UTI, Concorde experiences population fluctuations dictated by their clinical programmatic accreditors and how many student starts are allowed and the time required between those starts.\nOur tuition charges vary by type and length of our programs and the program level, such as core or advanced training. The UTI segment implemented tuition rate increases of up to 6.0%, 2.5% and 2.5% for each of the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the Concorde segment implemented a tuition rate increase of 3.0% for the year ended September 30, 2023. We regularly evaluate our tuition pricing based on individual campus markets, the competitive environment and ED regulations.\nFinancial Aid\nMost students at our campuses rely on funds received under various government-sponsored student financial aid programs, predominantly Title IV Programs and various veterans' benefits programs, to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education-related expenses. Approximately 67% of our revenues, on a cash basis, were collected from funds distributed under Title IV Programs for the year ended September 30, 2023 as calculated under the 90/10 rule. Additionally, approximately 10% of our revenues, on a cash basis, were collected from funds distributed under various veterans' benefits programs for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Company extends credit for tuition and fees, for a limited period of time, to the majority of our students. Our credit risk is mitigated through the students participation in federally funded financial aid and veterans' benefit programs unless students withdraw prior to the receipt by us of Title IV or veterans' benefit funds for those students. The financial aid and veterans' benefits programs are subject to political and budgetary considerations. There is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels. Extensive and complex regulations govern the financial assistance programs in which our students participate. Our administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies. Any regulatory violation could be the basis for the initiation of potential adverse actions, including a suspension, limitation, placement on reimbursement status or termination proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf any of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid or veterans' benefit programs, the students at that institution, and other locations of that institution, would lose access to funds derived from those programs and would have to seek alternative sources of funds to pay their tuition and fees. The receipt of financial aid and veterans benefit funds reduces the students amounts due to us and has no impact on revenue recognition, as the transfer relates to the source of funding for the costs of education which may occur through Title IV, veterans benefit or other funds and resources available to the student. Additionally, we bear all credit and collection risk for the portion of our student tuition that is funded through the proprietary loan program.\nOperating Expenses\nWe categorize our operating expenses as (i) educational services and facilities and (ii) selling, general and administrative.\nMajor components of educational services and facilities expenses include: faculty and other campus administration employees compensation and benefits; facility rent; maintenance; utilities; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used in the provision of educational services; tools; training aids; royalties under our licensing arrangements; and other costs directly associated with teaching our programs and providing educational services to our students.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include: compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, of employees who are not directly associated with the provision of educational services, such as executive management, finance and central accounting, information technology, legal, human resources, marketing and student admissions; marketing and student enrollment expenses; professional services; bad debt expense; costs associated with the implementation and operation of our student management and reporting system; rent for our corporate office headquarters; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that is not used in the provision of educational services; and other costs that are incidental to our operations. All marketing and student enrollment expenses are recognized in the period incurred. Costs related to the opening of new facilities, excluding related capital expenditures, are expensed in the period incurred or when services are provided.\n2023 Overview\nStudent Metrics\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 % Change\nUTI\nTotal new student starts 14,181 13,374 6.0 %\nAverage undergraduate full-time active students 12,614 12,838 (1.7) %\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time active students 14,833 14,380 3.2 %\nConcorde\nTotal new student starts 8,432 - 100.0 %\nAverage undergraduate full-time active students 7,654 - 100.0 %\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time active students 8,369 - 100.0 %\nConsolidated\nTotal new student starts 22,613 13,374 69.1 %\nAverage undergraduate full-time active students 20,268 12,838 57.9 %\nEnd of period undergraduate full-time active students 23,202 14,380 61.3 %\nThe increase in consolidated new student starts, average undergraduate full-time active students and end of period undergraduate full-time active students was due primarily to the acquisition of Concorde in December 2022. The new student starts for the UTI segment increased during the year, partially due to the opening of new campuses in Austin, Texas and Miramar, Florida during late fiscal 2022 and program expansion during both the current and prior year.\nOur ability to start new students can be influenced by various factors including: the state of the general macro-economic environment and its impact on price sensitivity and the ability and willingness of students and their families to incur debt to fund their education; unemployment rates; competition; adverse media coverage; legislative, or regulatory actions and investigations by attorneys general and various agencies related to allegations of wrongdoing on the part of other companies within the education and training services industry, which can cast the aggregate for-profit education industry in a negative light; and pandemics and or other national, state or local emergencies as declared by various government authorities. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOperations\nOur revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 were $607.4 million, an increase of $188.6 million, or 45.0%, from the prior year. Excluding Concorde, which contributed $178.1 million of revenue between December 1, 2022 and September 30, 2023, UTI revenues increased 2.5% when compared to the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2023, we had operating income of $21.4 million, as compared to $22.4 million in the prior year, with the acquired Concorde segment contributing $10.5 million. Our operating expenses for fiscal 2023 were $586.0 million, a 47.8% increase over the prior year, with the acquired Concorde segment contributing $167.6 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily driven by the incremental cost of delivery associated with UTI new campus and program rollouts in the prior year, and both one-time and ongoing investments in support of our growth and diversification strategy. Productivity improvements and proactive cost actions have been a key part of our operating model for the past several years, and we continue to identify and execute on efficiency opportunities throughout our cost structure, while improving and investing in the overall student experience. Net income for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $12.3 million compared to $25.8 million in the prior year.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy has three key tenets: to grow the business by more deeply penetrating existing target markets and adding new markets; to diversify the business by adding new locations, programs, and offerings that maximize the lifetime value of our students; and to continually optimize the business by constantly enhancing operational efficiency.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we executed the following as part of our growth, diversification and optimization strategy:\nAcquisition and Optimization\nWe closed the acquisition of Concorde on December 1, 2022. The acquisition aligns with our growth and diversification strategy, which is focused on offering a broader array of high-quality, in-demand workforce education solutions which both prepare students for a variety of careers in fast-growing fields and help close the country's skills gap by leveraging key industry partnerships.\nIn March 2023, we purchased the three primary buildings and the associated land at our UTI Orlando, Florida campus which were previously leased.\nProgram Expansion and New Industry Partnerships\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023 we started the following programs: Aviation at the UTI Avondale, Arizona and UTI Long Beach, California campuses; HVACR at the UTI Austin, Texas and NASCAR Tech campuses; Wind Energy Technician training at the UTI Rancho Cucamonga, California and UTI Lisle, Illinois campuses; Robotics and Automation at UTI Exton, Pennsylvania, UTI Lisle, Illinois, NASCAR Tech Mooresville, North Carolina, and the UTI Rancho Cucamonga, California campuses; and Welding at the UTI Sacramento, California campus.\nWe executed a new agreement which continues the UTI partnership with Snap-on Tools to ensure automotive, diesel, motorcycle, marine and collision repair technician students have the tools and training they need to launch careers in the transportation industry.\nUTI expanded the Volvo TEKNIKER Apprentice Program, a 12-week, manufacturer-paid apprentice program to Volvo's training facility in Ridgeville, South Carolina.\nIn addition, we continue to pursue other opportunities that align with our growth, diversification and optimization strategy.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nOperating expenses:\nEducational services and facilities 54.3 % 49.5 % 49.8 %\nSelling, general and administrative 42.2 % 45.2 % 45.8 %\nTotal operating expenses 96.5 % 94.7 % 95.6 %\nIncome from operations 3.5 % 5.3 % 4.4 %\nInterest (expense) income, net (0.6) % (0.4) % (0.1) %\nOther income (expense) 0.1 % (0.1) % 0.2 %\nTotal other (expense) income, net (0.5) % (0.5) % 0.1 %\nIncome before income taxes 3.0 % 4.8 % 4.5 %\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (0.9) % 1.3 % (0.2) %\nNet income 2.1 % 6.1 % 4.3 %\nPreferred stock dividends (0.8) % (1.2) % (1.6) %\nIncome available for distribution 1.3 % 4.9 % 2.7 %\nIncome allocated to participating securities (0.4) % (1.9) % (1.1) %\nNet income available to common shareholders 0.9 % 3.0 % 1.6 %\nYear Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022\nRevenues\nThe following table presents revenue by segment (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30, 2023 Year ended September 30, 2022\nUTI Concorde Consolidated UTI Concorde Consolidated\nRevenue $ 429,317 $ 178,091 $ 607,408 $ 418,765 $ - $ 418,765\nYear over Year % Change 2.5 % 100.0 % 45.0 %\nOur revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 were $607.4 million, an increase of $188.6 million, or 45.0%, as compared to revenues of $418.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nUTI\nRevenues for UTI for the year ended September 30, 2023 were $429.3 million, an increase of 2.5% versus the prior period. Revenue increased primarily due to the addition of two new campuses in fiscal 2022 and an overall increase in average revenue per student. This was partially offset by a 1.7% decrease in overall average undergraduate full-time active students due to lower student starts across many campuses over the last several quarters.\nWe recognized $8.8 million on an accrual basis related to revenues and interest under the proprietary loan program for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $9.1 million recognized for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nConcorde\nRevenues for Concorde, which represent ten months as Concorde was acquired on December 1, 2022, were $178.1 million. Concorde programs are offered year-round, however, there can be fluctuations in the student population due to the timing and size of class starts which are dictated by the accrediting bodies governing the clinical and core programs.\nEducational services and facilities expenses\nOur educational services and facilities expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 were $329.9 million, representing an increase of $122.6 million, or 59.2%, as compared to $207.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Concorde on December 1, 2022 and both ongoing and one-time costs associated with our growth, diversification, and optimization strategy.\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of our educational services and facilities expenses (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30, 2023\nUTI Concorde Consolidated\nSalaries, employee benefits and tax expense $ 111,030 $ 68,238 $ 179,268\nBonus expense 2,027 - 2,027\nStock-based compensation 192 - 192\nCompensation and related costs 113,249 68,238 181,487\nOccupancy costs 30,798 18,612 49,410\nSupplies, maintenance and student expense 27,357 14,114 41,471\nDepreciation and amortization expense 19,738 3,618 23,356\nContract services expense 3,763 431 4,194\nOther educational services and facilities expenses 21,666 8,286 29,952\nTotal educational services and facilities expense $ 216,571 $ 113,299 $ 329,870\nYear ended September 30, 2022\nUTI Concorde Consolidated\nSalaries, employee benefits and tax expense $ 106,016 $ - $ 106,016\nBonus expense 2,335 - 2,335\nStock-based compensation 240 - 240\nCompensation and related costs 108,591 - 108,591\nOccupancy costs 35,408 - 35,408\nSupplies, maintenance and student expense 22,295 - 22,295\nDepreciation and amortization expense 15,709 - 15,709\nContract services expense 4,764 - 4,764\nOther educational services and facilities expenses 20,466 - 20,466\nTotal educational services and facilities expense $ 207,233 $ - $ 207,233\nUTI\nCompensation and related costs increased $4.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased instructor salaries related to the opening of two new campuses in fiscal 2022 and new program expansions in fiscal 2022 and 2023.\nOccupancy costs decreased $4.6 million during fiscal year 2023. The decrease was primarily due to purchasing the Lisle, Illinois campus in February 2022 and the three primary buildings at our UTI Orlando, Florida campus in March 2023, as well as realizing the benefits of the consolidation of the MMI and UTI campuses in both Arizona and Florida into single sites during fiscal 2022.\nSupplies, maintenance and student expense increased by $5.1 million primarily due to approximately $4.4 million in additional grants for student housing and $1.2 million in technical supplies due to the addition of the UTI Austin, Texas and UTI Miramar, Florida campuses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $4.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the purchase of the UTI Lisle, Illinois campus during fiscal year 2022 and the three primary buildings at our UTI Orlando, Florida campus in March 2023.\nOther educational services and facilities expense increased by $1.2 million. The increase is primarily due to a gain of $1.6 million in the prior year period as a result of the settlement of the UTI Lisle, Illinois campus lease.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 were $256.1 million, representing an increase of $67.0 million, or 35.4%, as compared to $189.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Concorde on December 1, 2022 and both ongoing and one-time costs associated with our growth, diversification and optimization strategy.\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of our selling, general and administrative expenses (in thousands):\nYear ended September 30, 2023\nUTI Concorde Corporate Consolidated\nSalaries, employee benefits and tax expense $ 67,485 $ 21,401 $ 18,869 $ 107,755\nBonus expense 11,257 2,594 5,141 18,992\nStock-based compensation 877 - 2,779 3,656\nCompensation and related costs 79,619 23,995 26,789 130,403\nAdvertising and marketing expense 52,809 19,358 - 72,167\nProfessional and contract services expense 8,093 608 9,110 17,811\nIntangible asset impairment expense - - - -\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses 16,546 10,298 8,914 35,758\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses $ 157,067 $ 54,259 $ 44,813 $ 256,139\nYear ended September 30, 2022\nUTI Concorde Corporate Consolidated\nSalaries, employee benefits and tax expense $ 56,521 $ - $ 18,532 $ 75,053\nBonus expense 10,685 - 3,644 14,329\nStock-based compensation 648 - 3,524 4,172\nCompensation and related costs 67,854 - 25,700 93,554\nAdvertising and marketing expense 54,501 - - 54,501\nProfessional and contract services expense 4,412 - 10,157 14,569\nIntangible asset impairment expense 2,000 - - 2,000\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses 18,393 - 6,141 24,534\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses $ 147,160 $ - $ 41,998 $ 189,158\nUTI\nCompensation and related costs increased by $11.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growth, diversification and optimization initiatives.\nAdvertising and marketing expense decreased by $1.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior year. We continue to target cost-efficient marketing with an increased focus on digital media. Advertising expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to 12.3% for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 13.0% in the prior year.\nProfessional and contract services increased by $3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increases were primarily due to costs incurred related to our growth, diversification and optimization initiatives.\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior year, due to a decrease of $0.9 million for bad debt expense and $0.8 million for employee recruitment and hiring.\nConcorde\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Concorde for the ten months ended September 30, 2023, were $54.3 million. Concorde advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue for the ten months ended September 30, 2023 was 10.9%.\nCorporate\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate increased by $2.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to increased integration costs of $2.8 million which is included within other selling, general and administrative costs.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOther expense for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $3.3 million, compared to other income of $1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The $3.3 million of other expense in fiscal 2023 was comprised primarily of $9.7 million of interest expense from our revolving credit facility and existing term loans, partially offset by interest income of $5.9 million.\nIncome taxes\nOur income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $5.8 million, or 31.9% of pre-tax income, compared to an income tax benefit of $5.4 million, or 26.5% of pre-tax income, for the year ended September 30, 2022. The effective income tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2023 differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to non-deductible executive compensation, transaction costs, federal research and development tax credits and state and local income and franchise taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2022 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily as a result of changes in the valuation allowance and state taxes. The tax benefit recorded during the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily relates to the $12.1 million release of the valuation allowance during the period and the impact of the MIAT deferred tax liability for indefinite lived intangibles which are available to offset a portion of our indefinite lived deferred tax assets. See Note 16 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nPreferred stock dividends\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, 675,885 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, respectively. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock, we paid preferred stock cash dividends of $5.1 million and $5.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 18 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the preferred stock.\nIncome available for distribution\nIncome available for distribution refers to net income reduced by dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of the foregoing, we reported income available for distribution for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 of $7.3 million and $20.7 million, respectively.\nIncome allocated to participating securities\nOur Series A Preferred Stock is considered a participating security because, in the event that we pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding common stock, we must also pay each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock a dividend on an as-converted basis. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities according to dividend and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method,\nall earnings, distributed and undistributed, are allocated to common shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. The amount of income allocated to the participating securities for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $2.7 million and $7.8 million, respectively.\nNet income available to common shareholders\nAfter allocating the income to the participating securities, we had $4.5 million and $12.8 million of net income available to common shareholders for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor a discussion of the financial results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations, of our 2022 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 12, 2022 which discussion is incorporated herein by reference and which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $47.1 million, $38.8 million and $29.5 million, respectively. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) for the year, before interest (income) expense, income tax (benefit) expense, and depreciation and amortization.\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is provided to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We choose to disclose this non-GAAP financial measure because it provides an additional analytical tool to clarify our results from operations and helps to identify underlying trends. Additionally, this measure helps compare our performance on a consistent basis across time periods. Management also utilizes EBITDA as an internal performance measure. To obtain a complete understanding of our performance, this measure should be examined in connection with net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. Since the items excluded from this measure are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, this measure should not be considered to be an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure across companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance.\nEBITDA reconciles to net income as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 12,322 $ 25,848 $ 14,581\nInterest expense (income), net 3,795 1,495 282\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 5,765 (5,407) 602\nDepreciation and amortization 25,215 16,883 14,028\nEBITDA $ 47,097 $ 38,819 $ 29,493\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Liquidity\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash flows from operations, cash on hand and investments will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations, as well as announced growth and diversification initiatives through the next fiscal year and beyond. Our cash position is available to fund strategic long-term growth initiatives, including opening additional campuses in new markets and the creation and expansion of new programs, such as welding, in existing markets and campus facilities.\nOur aggregate liquidity as of September 30, 2023 totaled $159.7 million and was comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $151.5 million and undrawn revolving credit facility capacity of $8.2 million. This represents an increase of $64.4 million from our total liquidity as of September 30, 2022.\nStrategic Uses of Cash\nOn December 1, 2022, using funds from our new revolving credit facility, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Concorde for a base purchase price of $50.0 million, less $1.9 million in net adjustments including the post-closing working capital adjustment, for total cash consideration paid of $48.1 million. The net cash consideration, taking into account cash acquired from Concorde, was $16.4 million. See Note 4 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the acquisition.\nWe purchased three buildings and land at our UTI Orlando, Florida campus in March 2023 for approximately $26.2 million, including closing costs and other fees. We used previously drawn funds from our revolving credit facility to complete the purchase.\nWe believe that additional uses of our cash resources may include consideration of strategic acquisitions and organic growth initiatives, purchase of real estate assets, subsidizing funding alternatives for our students, and the repurchase of common stock, among others. To the extent that potential acquisitions are large enough to require financing beyond cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, or available revolving credit facility capacity, or we need capital to fund operations, new campus openings or expansion of programs at existing campuses, we may enter into additional credit facilities, issue debt or issue additional equity.\nLong-term Debt\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had $162.6 million of long-term debt outstanding, which is comprised of two term loans, a finance lease and a revolving credit facility. Of the $162.6 million outstanding, $29.3 million relates to a term loan that bears interest at the rate of Term SOFR plus 2.0% and a tranche rate adjustment of 0.046% over the seven-year term secured in connection with the UTI Avondale, Arizona campus property purchased in December 2020. Approximately $37.7 million relates to a term loan that bears interest at the rate of Term SOFR plus 2.0% over the seven-year term, secured in connection with the purchase of the UTI Lisle, Illinois campus property in February 2022. Approximately $5.6 million relates to a finance lease for a campus within our Concorde segment. The remaining $90.0 million relates to funds drawn from the $100.0 million revolving credit facility that was secured in connection with the Concorde acquisition. See Note 14 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the term loans and the revolving credit facility.\nDividends\nWe currently do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. For our outstanding Series A preferred shares, we paid preferred stock cash dividends of $5.1 million and $5.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The preferred stock dividends are subject to adjustment for any preferred stock conversions that occur during the year.\nPrincipal Sources of Liquidity\nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows and existing cash and cash equivalents. A majority of our revenues are derived from Title IV Programs and various veterans benefits programs. Federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under Title IV Programs. Students must apply for new funding for each academic year consisting of 30-week periods. Loan funds are generally provided in two disbursements for each academic year. The first disbursement for first-time borrowers is usually received 30 days after the start of a students academic year, and the second disbursement is typically received at the beginning of the 16th week from the start of the students academic year. Under our UTI proprietary loan program, we bear all credit and collection risk and students are not required to begin repayment until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. Similarly, we bear all credit and collection risk for students paying through UTI cash payment plans and those under a retail installment contract at Concorde. These factors, together with the timing of when our students begin their programs, affect the timing and seasonality of our operating cash flow.\nSurety Bonds\nEach of our campuses must be authorized by the applicable state education agency in which the campus is located to operate and to grant certificates, diplomas or degrees to its students. Our campuses are subject to extensive, ongoing regulation by each of these states. Additionally, our campuses are required to be authorized by the applicable state education agencies of certain other states in which our campuses recruit students. Our insurers issue surety bonds for us on behalf of our campuses and admissions representatives with multiple states to maintain authorization to conduct our business. We are obligated to\nreimburse our insurers for any surety bonds that are paid by the insurers. As of September 30, 2023, the total face amount of these surety bonds was approximately $22.3 million.\nOperating Activities\nOur net cash provided by operating activities was $49.1 million and $46.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNet income, after adjustments for non-cash items, provided cash of $71.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. The non-cash items included $25.2 million for depreciation and amortization expense, $20.6 million for amortization of right-of-use assets for operating leases, $4.6 million of deferred taxes, $3.8 million for stock-based compensation expense and $3.3 million for bad debt expense.\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended September 30, 2023 used cash of $22.7 million primarily due to the following:\nChanges in our operating lease liability as a result of rent payments used cash of $20.5 million.\nThe change in deferred revenue provided cash of $11.4 million and was primarily attributable to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at period end in relation to completion of their program at September 30, 2023 as compared to September 30, 2022.\nChanges in our accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments used cash of $5.9 million.\nThe increase in receivables used cash of $4.9 million and was primarily due to the timing of Title IV disbursements and other cash receipts on behalf of our students.\nNet income, after adjustments for non-cash items, for the year ended September 30, 2022 provided cash of $64.8 million. The non-cash items included $16.9 million for depreciation and amortization expense, $15.9 million for amortization of right-of -use assets for operating leases, $4.3 million for stock-based compensation expense, and $2.5 million for bad debt expense, partially offset by an adjustment of deferred taxes of $6.0 million due primarily to the release of our valuation allowance during the year.\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended September 30, 2022 used cash of $18.8 million primarily due to the following:\nChanges in our operating lease liability as a result of rent payments used cash of $14.0 million.\nChanges in our accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments provided cash of $5.7 million.\nThe decrease in deferred revenue used cash of $5.3 million and was primarily attributable to the timing of student starts, the number of students in school and where they were at period end in relation to completion of their program at September 30, 2022 as compared to September 30, 2021.\nThe increase in prepaid expense and other current assets used cash of $1.7 million primarily related to the change in training equipment credits earned as of September 30, 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $44.1 million. The cash outflow was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $56.7 million. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we purchased three buildings and the associated land at our UTI Orlando, Florida campus for $26.2 million. Additionally, we had continued capital expenditures for further construction at the UTI Austin, Texas and Miramar, Florida campuses, in addition to program expansion costs for both UTI and Concorde. Further, on December 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Concorde which resulted in $16.4 million of cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Partially offsetting the cash outflows, is the $29.0 million in proceeds from maturities of held-to-maturity securities.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $134.6 million. The cash outflow was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $79.5 million, of which $28.7 million related to the purchase of the UTI Lisle, Illinois campus. Other capital expenditures included investments for new UTI campuses in Austin, Texas and Miramar, Florida, the consolidation of the UTI Orlando, Florida and the UTI Arizona campuses, and the rollout of new\nprograms at the UTI campuses. We purchased $28.8 million of short term held-to-maturity investments. Additionally, we purchased MIAT for $26.5 million, net of cash consideration received.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $81.8 million which was primarily related to proceeds from our revolving credit facility of $90.0 million, offset by the semi-annual payments of preferred stock dividends of $5.1 million, and the repayment of long-term debt of $1.8 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $12.6 million which was primarily related to proceeds from the term loan related to the UTI Lisle, Illinois campus purchase of $38.0 million, offset by the repayment of long-term debt of $19.2 million and the semi-annual payments of preferred stock dividends of $5.2 million.\nFor a discussion of our liquidity for the year ended September 30 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations, of our 2022 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 12, 2022 which discussion is incorporated herein by reference and which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn December 10, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan that would allow for the repurchase of up to $35.0 million of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This new share repurchase plan replaced the previously authorized plan from fiscal 2012. Any repurchases under this new stock repurchase program require the approval of a majority of the voting power of our Series A Preferred Stock. We did not repurchase any shares during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in total student population and costs associated with opening or expanding our campuses. Our student population varies as a result of new student enrollments, graduations and student attrition. Historically, we have had lower student populations in our third quarter than in the remainder of our year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. Additionally, we have had higher student populations in our fourth quarter than in the remainder of the year because more students enroll during this period. Our expenses, however, do not vary significantly with changes in student population and revenues and, as a result, such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. Such patterns may change, however, as a result of new school openings, new program introductions, increased enrollments of adult students or acquisitions. Furthermore, our revenues for the first quarter ending December 31 are impacted by the closure of our campuses for a week in December for a holiday break and during which we do not earn revenue.\nRevenues\n(Dollars shown in thousands) Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nThree Month Period Ending: Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent\nDecember 31 $ 120,004 19.8 % $ 105,075 25.1 % $ 76,125 22.7 %\nMarch 31 163,820 27.0 % 102,086 24.4 % 77,709 23.2 %\nJune 30 153,286 25.2 % 100,966 24.1 % 83,768 25.0 %\nSeptember 30 170,298 28.0 % 110,638 26.4 % 97,481 29.1 %\nTotal fiscal year $ 607,408 100.0 % $ 418,765 100.0 % $ 335,083 100.0 %\nThe increase in revenues for each of the three months ended December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2022, was due to an increase in student population during fiscal 2023 primarily related to the acquisition of Concorde.\nThe increase in revenues for each of the three months ended December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2021, was primarily due to an increase in student population during fiscal 2022 in conjunction with the acquisition of MIAT. The first three periods also benefited from lower average revenue per student in the prior year period due to lingering impacts of COVID-19.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\n(Dollars shown in thousands) Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nThree Month Period Ending: Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent\nDecember 31 $ 4,448 20.8 % $ 13,578 60.7 % $ 775 5.2 %\nMarch 31 5,949 27.8 % 3,377 15.1 % (1,661) (11.1) %\nJune 30 663 3.1 % 1,954 8.7 % 3,052 20.4 %\nSeptember 30 10,339 48.3 % 3,465 15.5 % 12,781 85.5 %\nTotal fiscal year $ 21,399 100.0 % $ 22,374 100.0 % $ 14,947 100.0 %\nThe decrease in income from operations for fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growth, diversification and optimization initiatives.\nThe increase in income from operations for fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to increased revenues well as continued execution of cost control measures.\nEffect of Inflation\nTo date, inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, the proprietary loan program, allowance for uncollectible accounts, goodwill recoverability, self-insurance claim liabilities, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require managements most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for discounts and scholarships that we sponsor and for refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates. We apply the five-step model outlined in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts from Customers (ASC 606). Tuition and fee revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the course or program offered. Approximately 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consisted of gross tuition.\nThe majority of the UTI programs are designed to be completed in 30 to 100 weeks. The UTI advanced training programs range from 8 to 26 weeks in duration. UTI also provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers. Revenues are recognized as transfer of the services occurs. The majority of Concordes core programs are\nnine to ten months in duration, Concordes clinical programs are completed in 12 to 24 months. In addition to revenue from tuition and fees, UTI and Concorde derive supplemental revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies and other revenues, which are recognized as the transfer of goods or services occurs. Deferred revenue represents the excess of tuition and fee payments received as compared to tuition and fees earned and is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets because it is expected to be earned within the next 12 months.\nAll of our revenues are generated within the United States. The impact of economic factors on the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows is consistent across our various programs for both the UTI and Concorde segments.\nProprietary Loan Program\nIn order to provide funding for students who are not able to fully finance the cost of their education under traditional governmental financial aid programs, commercial loan programs or other alternative sources, we established a private loan program with a bank. This program is currently offered to students at our UTI and MMI branded schools. Through the proprietary loan program, the bank originates the loans to the students who participate in this program for a portion of their tuition. Based on historical collection rates, we can demonstrate that a portion of these loans are collectible. Accordingly, we recognize tuition and loan origination fees financed by the loan and any related interest revenue under the effective interest method required under the loan based on this collection rate.\nUnder the terms of the proprietary loan program, the bank originates loans for our students who meet specific criteria with the related proceeds used exclusively to fund a portion of their tuition. We then purchase all such loans from the bank at least monthly and assume all of the related credit risk. The loans bear interest at market rates ranging from approximately 6% to 10%; however, principal and interest payments are not required until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. After the deferral period, monthly principal and interest payments are required over the related term of the loan. The repayment term is up to 10 years.\nUnder ASC 606, the portion of tuition revenue related to the proprietary loan program is considered a form of variable consideration. We estimate the amount we ultimately expect to collect from the portion of tuition that is funded by the proprietary loan program, resulting in a note receivable. Estimating the collection rate requires significant management judgment. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326) as of October 1, 2020, we revised our estimated collection rate to only include historical collections from the past ten years as we determined that such population better represents our current expected collections and aligns with the typical term of the loan. The estimated amount is determined at the inception of the contract and we recognize the related revenue as the student progresses through school. Each reporting period, we update our assessment of the variable consideration associated with the proprietary loan program.\nAllowance for uncollectible accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our students to make required payments. We offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expenses not covered by financial aid programs or alternate fund sources, which are unsecured and not guaranteed.\nWe use estimates that are subjective and require judgment in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, which are principally based on accounts receivable, historical percentages of uncollectible accounts, customer credit worthiness and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. We also monitor and consider external factors such as changes in the economic and regulatory environment. We use an internal group of collectors, augmented by third party collectors as deemed appropriate, in our collection efforts. When a student with Title IV loans withdraws, Title IV rules determine if we are required to return a portion of Title IV funds to the lender. We are then entitled to collect these funds from the students, but collection rates for these types of receivables is significantly lower than our collection rates for receivables for students who remain in our programs.\nAlthough we believe that our allowance is adequate, if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, which would result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nDetermining the fair value of acquired goodwill and intangible assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated\nfair value include, but are not limited to, future tuition revenues, operating costs, working capital changes, capital expenditures and a discount rate. The assumptions used in determining our expected future cash flows consider various factors such as historical operating trends particularly in student enrollment and pricing and long-term operating strategies and initiatives. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining the value of acquired goodwill and intangible assets.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, which are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining our provision for income taxes.\nEach reporting period, we estimate the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets, which represent timing differences in the recognition of revenue and certain tax deductions for accounting and tax purposes. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent, in part, upon future taxable income. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. Such valuation allowance is maintained on our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal in future periods. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Significant judgment is required to determine if, and the extent to which, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets. Changes in the valuation allowance are included in our statement of operations as a charge or credit to income tax benefit (expense).\nAs a result of our assessment, income tax (expense) benefit within our statements of operations was impacted by a decrease of $0.2 million and $12.1 million in the valuation allowance during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future periods if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased and if additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. We will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance in future periods for any change in circumstances that causes a change in judgment about the realizability of the deferred tax assets.\nAlthough we believe that our estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, and the outcome of future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assessment of recoverable deferred tax assets inaccurate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective that are expected to have an impact on our financial statements. Note 3 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a discussion on Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting which was effective in fiscal 2023. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur principal exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates.\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds. As of September 30, 2023, we held $151.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we earned interest income of $5.9 million. As we have a conservative investment policy, our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to our interest income is expected to remain low. We do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events.\nOn May 12, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement to finance the UTI Avondale, Arizona campus through a $31.2 million term loan that bore interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.0% with a maturity of seven years. On April 3, 2023, in connection with applying the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, we executed an amendment for our Avondale term loan to convert the stated rate from LIBOR to Term SOFR. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the Avondale term loan was $29.3\nmillion and bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 2.0% and a tranche adjustment of 0.046%, which was 7.38% as of September 30, 2023.\nOn April 14, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement to finance the UTI Lisle, Illinois campus through a $38.0 million term loan that bears interest at the rate of Term SOFR plus 2.0% with a maturity of seven years. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the Lisle term loan was $37.7 million and bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 2.0%, which was 7.33% as of September 30, 2023.\nWe believe the carrying value of the Avondale and Lisle term loans approximate fair value as the interest rate is a floating rate equal to Term SOFR plus 2.0%, which is representative of market rates for similar instruments. It is anticipated that the fair market value of our Avondale and Lisle term loans will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and we do not believe that the value of this debt has been significantly impacted by current market events. The variable rate of interest on our long-term debt can expose us to interest rate volatility due to changes in Term SOFR. To mitigate this exposure, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rates on 50% of the principal amounts of the term loans at 1.45% and 4.69% for the entire loan term on our Avondale debt and Lisle debt, respectively.\nOn November 18, 2022, we entered into a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility that bears variable interest in a maturity of three years. On November 28, 2022, we drew $90.0 million from the credit facility in support of the closing of the Concorde acquisition.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we recorded interest expense of $9.7 million on our outstanding debt. Assuming all terms of our outstanding long-term debt remained the same, a hypothetical 10.0% change (up or down) in the variable rates would result in a $12.3 million change to our annual interest expense for the portion of the long-term debt not hedged by the interest rate swap agreement.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2023. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the\nCompany in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Concorde Career Colleges, Inc. We have excluded the acquired business from our assessment and report on internal control over financial reporting for the year ended September 30, 2023, as permitted under SEC rules. Other than the foregoing, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the attestation report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are included on pages and, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are hereby incorporated by reference.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls also can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nManagements Certifications\nThe Company has filed as exhibits to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC, the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Company has submitted to the NYSE the most recent Annual Chief Executive Officer Certification as required by Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of the companys assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management and director authorization; and providing reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Concorde Career Colleges, Inc. (Concorde) on December 1, 2022. Management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Concorde, which represented approximately 18% of total assets as of September 30, 2023, and approximately 29% of revenues for the year then ended.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Universal Technical Institute, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Universal Technical Institute, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated December 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Concorde Career Colleges, Inc. (Concorde), which was acquired on December 1, 2022, and whose financial statements constitute 18% of total assets and 29% of revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Concorde.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nTempe, Arizona\nDecember 1, 2023\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Universal Technical Institute, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Technical Institute, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, other comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenues - Proprietary Loan Program Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 2 in the FY 2023 Form 10K\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe portion of tuition revenue related to the Companys proprietary loan program is considered a form of variable consideration, in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company estimates the amount it expects to collect on these loans by calculating the amount due compared to historical loan collections over the past 10 years, and recognizes that amount of estimated revenue over the students program, resulting in a Notes Receivable balance of $36.7 million as of September 30, 2023. We identified the expected collection rate for the proprietary loan program as a critical audit matter, because the Company evaluates the collection rate of its outstanding loans each quarter, which requires significant management judgment. The Company currently uses the actual collection experience over the past 10 years to determine the expected collection rate.\nThe key judgment made by management is the length of historical collection experience used to calculate the expected collection rate and requires a high degree of auditor judgement in determining the reasonableness of the period of time used by management to estimate the expected collection rate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the expected collection rate for the proprietary loan program included the following, among others:\nTested the design and effectiveness of the Companys internal controls related to the Companys evaluation of the proprietary loan program expected collection rate.\nConsidered how the expected collection rate might change if the Company had used a different time period in the calculation of the expected collection rate, and the impact it would have on the financial statements.\nRecalculated the expected collection rate based on the actual collection rates of the loan portfolio for the most recent 10 years.\nEvaluated the underlying historical loan data by making selections of loans included in the data population and traced to source documentation, and recalculated the amount of the loan due as of the reporting date.\nAgreed monthly loan collection amounts for selected months to bank statements.\nTested completeness of the loan data population by tracing a selection of students from historical accounting records to the underlying population used to calculate the expected collection rate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nTempe, Arizona\nDecember 1, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNote 1 - Business Description\nUniversal Technical Institute, Inc., which together with its subsidiaries is referred to as the Company, we, us or our, was founded in 1965 and is a leading workforce solutions provider of transportation, skilled trades and healthcare education programs, whose mission is to serve students, partners, and communities by providing quality education and support services for in-demand careers across a number of highly-skilled fields. We offer the majority of our programs in a blended learning model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. In conjunction with the Concorde Career Colleges, Inc. acquisition on December 1, 2022 (the Concorde Acquisition), we redefined our reporting structure into two reportable segments as follows:\nUniversal Technical Institute (UTI): UTI operates 16 campuses located in nine states and offers a wide range of degree and non-degree transportation and skilled trades technical training programs under brands such as Universal Technical Institute, Motorcycle Mechanics Institute and Marine Mechanics Institute (MMI), NASCAR Technical Institute, and MIAT College of Technology (MIAT). UTI also offers manufacturer specific advanced training programs, which include student-paid electives, at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at certain campuses and dedicated training centers. Lastly, UTI provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers. UTI works closely with multiple original equipment manufacturers and industry brand partners to understand their needs for qualified service professionals.\nConcorde Career Colleges (Concorde): Concorde operates 17 campuses located in eight states and online, offering degree, non-degree, and continuing education programs in the allied health, dental, nursing, patient care and diagnostic fields. The Company has designated campuses that offer degree granting programs Concorde Career College; where allowed by State regulation. The remaining campuses are designated as Concorde Career Institute. Concorde believes in preparing students for their healthcare careers with practical, hands-on experiences including opportunities to learn while providing care to real patients. Prior to graduation, students will complete a number of hours in a clinical setting or externship, depending upon their program of study. We acquired Concorde on December 1, 2022. See Note 4 on Acquisitions for additional information.\nCorporate includes corporate related expenses that are not allocated to the UTI or Concorde reportable segments. In prior years, these costs were allocated across our former Postsecondary Education reportable segment and Other category based upon compensation expense. Additional information about our reportable segments is presented in Note 22.\nOur primary source of revenues is currently tuition and fees paid by students. To pay for a substantial portion of their tuition, the majority of students rely on funds received from federal financial aid programs under Title IV Programs of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), as well as from various veterans benefits programs. For further discussion, see Note 2 on Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Concentration of Risk and Note 23 on Government Regulation and Financial Aid.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, the proprietary loan program, allowance for uncollectible accounts, investments, property and equipment, goodwill recoverability, self-insurance claim liabilities, income taxes, contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, restricted cash, held-to-maturity investments (when outstanding), accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, deferred tuition, and debt approximates their respective fair value as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to the short-term nature of these instruments or variable interest rates which approximate market rates.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash includes funds held as collateral for certain of the surety bonds that our insurers issue on behalf of our campuses and admissions representatives with multiple states which are required to maintain authorization to conduct our business, funds transferred in advance of loan purchases under the proprietary loan program and funds held for students from Title IV financial aid program funds that result in credit balances on a students account. Additionally, we have letters of credit with some of our landlords in connection with leased campuses.\nProprietary Loan Program\nIn order to provide funding for students who are not able to fully finance the cost of their education under traditional governmental financial aid programs, commercial loan programs or other alternative sources, we established a private loan program with a bank. This program is currently offered to students at our UTI and MMI branded schools. Through the proprietary loan program, the bank originates the loans to the students who participate in this program for a portion of their tuition. Based on historical collection rates, we can demonstrate that a portion of these loans are collectible. Accordingly, we recognize tuition and loan origination fees financed by the loan and any related interest revenue under the effective interest method required under the loan based on this collection rate.\nUnder the terms of the proprietary loan program, the bank originates loans for our selected UTI and MMI students who meet specific criteria with the related proceeds used exclusively to fund a portion of their tuition. We then purchase all such loans from the bank at least monthly and assume all of the related credit risk. The loans bear interest at market rates ranging from approximately 6% to 10%; however, principal and interest payments are not required until six months after the student completes or withdraws from his or her program. After the deferral period, monthly principal and interest payments are required over the related term of the loan. The repayment term is up to 10 years.\nThe bank provides these services in exchange for a fee at a percentage of the principal balance of each loan and related fees. Under the terms of the related agreement, we transfer funds for loan purchases to a deposit account with the bank in advance of the bank funding the loan, which secures our related loan purchase obligation. Such funds are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAll related expenses incurred with the bank or other service providers are expensed as incurred within educational services and facilities expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were approximately $1.0 million, $1.1 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe portion of tuition revenue related to the proprietary loan program is considered a form of variable consideration. We estimate the amount we ultimately expect to collect from the portion of tuition that is funded by the proprietary loan program, resulting in a note receivable. These amounts are presented as Notes receivable, current portion and Notes receivable, less current portion on our consolidated balance sheets. Estimating the collection rate requires significant management judgment. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326) as of October 1, 2020, we revised our estimated collection rate to only include historical collections from the past ten years as we determined that such population better represents our current expected collections and aligns with the typical term of the loan. The estimated amount is determined at the inception of the contract, and we recognize the related revenue as the student progresses through school. Each reporting period, we update our assessment of the variable collection rate associated with the proprietary loan program.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nRetail Installment Contract Receivables\nConcorde currently and historically offers certain students retail installment contracts for payment of their tuition that are not covered by federal student financial aid or other funding sources. The retail installment contracts are due to Concorde from current and former students, are generally due over a period of up to five years, and bear interest at market rates ranging from 0 percent to 15 percent. Starting in fiscal year 2023, retail installment contracts are being issued at interest rates between 0 percent to 9 percent. Due to the fact that there is no interest imposed on certain of the retail installment contracts, primarily while students are actively completing their selected programs, we calculate the imputed interest expense on the retail installment contracts. However, the imputed interest expense is not considered material for such retail installment contracts. Retail installment contract receivables are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The allowance for credit losses is recognized at inception and is reassessed each reporting period. The short-term portion of the retail installment contract receivable and related allowance for credit losses are included in Receivables, net while the long-term portion of the retail installment contract receivable and related allowance for credit losses is presented in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our students to make required payments. As previously noted, we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay the portion of their education expenses not covered by financial aid programs or alternate fund sources, which are unsecured and not guaranteed. Management analyzes accounts receivable, historical percentages of uncollectible accounts, customer credit worthiness and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. We use an internal group of collectors, augmented by third party collectors as deemed appropriate, in our collection efforts. Although we believe that our allowance is adequate, if the financial condition of our students deteriorates, resulting in their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, which would result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated using the straight-line method over the remaining useful life of the asset or term of lease, whichever is shorter. Costs relating to software developed for internal use and curriculum development are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the related estimated useful lives. Such costs include direct costs of materials and services, as well as payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with the projects. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\nWe review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment by examining estimated future cash flows. These cash flows are evaluated by using probability weighting techniques as well as comparisons of past performance against projections. Assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values. If we determine that an assets carrying value is impaired, we will write-down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value and record the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made. There were no impairment charges recorded for property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nOur goodwill balance of $28.5 million as of September 30, 2023 resulted from our MMI, MIAT and Concorde acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We also have definite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of purchased intangibles and capitalized curriculum development costs. The definite-lived intangible assets are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of August 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, to evaluate the impairment of goodwill, we first assess qualitative factors, such as deterioration in the operating performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in the applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances, to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount based on our qualitative assessment, or that a qualitative assessment should not be performed, we proceed with the quantitative impairment tests for goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of its net assets. An impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. To evaluate the impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, we assess the fair value of the assets to determine whether they were greater or less than the carrying values.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value include, but are not limited to, future tuition revenues, operating costs, working capital changes, capital expenditures and a discount rate. The assumptions used in determining our expected future cash flows consider various factors such as historical operating trends particularly in student enrollment and pricing and long-term operating strategies and initiatives. Based on our qualitative assessment, there were no indicators of impairment for our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2023.\nSee Note 10 and Note 11 for additional details on our goodwill and intangible assets.\nSelf-Insurance Plans\nWe are self-insured for claims related to employee health and dental care and claims related to workers compensation. Liabilities associated with these plans are estimated by management with consideration of our historical loss experience, severity factors and independent actuarial analysis. Our claim liabilities are based on estimates, and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate, the ultimate losses may differ from the amounts provided. Our recorded net liability related to self-insurance plans was $4.9 million as of September 30, 2023.\nLeases\nWe lease the majority of our administrative and educational facilities under operating lease agreements. ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842) requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for substantially all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income.\nTo determine if a contract is or contains a lease, we considered whether (1) explicitly or implicitly identified assets have been deployed in the contract and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract. If we determine a contract is, or contains, a lease, we assess whether the contract contains multiple lease components. We consider a lease component to be separate from other lease components in the contract if (a) we can benefit from the right of use either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to us and (b) the right of use is neither highly dependent on nor highly interrelated with the other right(s) to use underlying assets in the contract. In contracts involving the use of real estate, we separate the right to use land from other underlying assets unless the effect of separating the land is insignificant to the resulting lease accounting. We have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nFor all our leases the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Therefore, we use our incremental borrowing rate for each lease to determine the present value of the lease. We calculate the incremental borrowing rate applicable to each lease through a model that represents the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The incremental borrowing rate applied to each lease is based on the remaining term of the lease. See Note 12 for additional disclosures on our leases.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nOn occasion, we may use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk and limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, primarily with variable-rate debt. We recognize all derivatives at fair value within the line items Other current assets, Other assets, Other current liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Management reviews our derivative positions and overall risk management strategy on a regular basis. We only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe may choose to designate our derivative financial instruments, which are generally interest rate swaps, to hedge future interest payments on variable debt. At inception of the transaction, we formally designate and document the derivative financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. We formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, the effectiveness of our hedging transactions. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative financial instruments will generally be offset by the changes in the cash flows or fair value of the underlying exposures being hedged.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets. For cash flow hedges, we report the effective portion of the gain or loss as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassify it to Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the corresponding period of the underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument is recognized in Interest expense at the time the ineffectiveness occurs. To the extent the hedged forecasted interest payments on debt related to our interest rate swap is paid off, the remaining balance in Accumulated other comprehensive income is recognized in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSee Note 15 for additional disclosures related to our derivative financial instruments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for discounts and scholarships that we sponsor and for refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates. We apply the five-step model outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts from Customers (ASC 606). Tuition and fee revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the course or program offered. Approximately 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consisted of gross tuition. See Note 5 for further information on our revenues.\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs\nCosts related to advertising and marketing are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately $72.2 million, $54.5 million, and $40.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe granted restricted stock units with service only conditions (RSUs) and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions (PSUs) during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. We did not grant any stock options during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Shares issued under our equity compensation plans are new shares.\nCompensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on the grant date fair value of our common stock and recognized on straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nWe estimate the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation which requires assumptions for expected volatility, risk-free rates of return, and dividend yields. Expected volatilities are derived using a method that calculates historical volatility over a period equal to the length of the measurement period. We use a risk-free rate of return that is equal to the yield of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bill that is commensurate with each measurement period, and we assume that any dividends paid were reinvested. Actual results against the performance condition are measured at the end of the performance period, which typically coincides with the vesting period. The fair value of the PSUs is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon the fair market value on the date of grant, adjusted on a quarterly basis for the anticipated or actual achievement against the established performance condition.\nWe issue stock-based compensation awards to certain members of management as well as our non-employee directors. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including, but not limited to, our expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock exercise behaviors. We evaluate our assumptions on the date of each grant.\nStock-based compensation expense of $3.8 million, $4.4 million and $1.8 million was recorded for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The tax benefit related to stock-based compensation recognized was $1.0 million, $1.1 million, and $0.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 19 for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We also recognize deferred tax assets for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced through a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Note 16 for additional details.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and receivables. We do also on occasion invest in short-term held-to-maturity investments.\nWe place our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term held-to-maturity investments with high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. We mitigate the concentration risk of our investments by limiting the amount invested in any one issuer. We mitigate the risk associated with our investment in corporate bonds by requiring a minimum credit rating of A. We have the ability and intention to hold our short-term investments until maturity and therefore have classified these investments as held-to-maturity and recorded them at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2023, we held cash and cash equivalents of $151.5 million and restricted cash of $5.4 million. There were no short-term held-to-maturity investments outstanding as of September 30, 2023.\nWe extend credit for tuition and fees, for a limited period of time, to a majority of our students. A substantial portion is repaid through the students participation in federally funded financial aid programs. Transfers of funds from the financial aid programs to us are made in accordance with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requirements. Approximately 67% of our revenues, on a cash basis, were collected from funds distributed under Title IV Programs for the year ended September 30, 2023 as calculated under the 90/10 rule. Additionally, approximately 10% of our revenues, on a cash basis, were collected from funds distributed under various veterans benefits programs for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThe financial aid and veterans benefits programs are subject to political and budgetary considerations. There is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels. Extensive and complex regulations govern the financial assistance programs in which our students participate. Our administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies. Any regulatory violation could be the basis for the initiation of potential adverse actions, including a suspension, limitation, placement on reimbursement status or termination proceeding, which could have a material adverse\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\neffect on our business. ED and other regulators have increased the frequency and severity of their enforcement actions against postsecondary schools which have resulted in the imposition of material liabilities, sanctions, letter of credit requirements and other restrictions and, in some cases, resulted in the loss of schools eligibility to receive Title IV funds or in closure of the schools.\nIf any of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs, the students at that institution would lose access to funds derived from those programs and would have to seek alternative sources of funds to pay their tuition and fees. Students obtain access to federal student financial aid through an ED prescribed application and eligibility certification process. Student financial aid funds are generally made available to students at prescribed intervals throughout their predetermined expected length of study. Students typically apply the funds received from the federal financial aid programs to pay their tuition and fees. The transfer of funds is from the financial aid program to the student, who then uses those funds to pay for a portion of the cost of their education. The receipt of financial aid funds reduces the students amounts due to us and has no impact on revenue recognition, as the transfer relates to the source of funding for the costs of education, which may occur either through Title IV or other funds and resources available to the student.\nReclassifications\nAs previously noted, as a result of the Concorde Acquisition, beginning with the year ended September 30, 2023, we have two reportable segments: UTI and Concorde. Additionally, Corporate includes corporate related expenses that are not allocated to either the UTI or Concorde reportable segments. The segment disclosures presented in Note 22 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2022 have been revised from the prior year presentation to reflect the new reportable segments.\nAdditionally, starting with the year ended September 30, 2023, we have reclassified Accrued tool sets into Accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets for reporting purposes. As of September 30, 2022, $3.2 million was reclassified from Accrued tool sets to Accounts payable and other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets for comparable presentation. The breakout of accrued tool sets is now disclosed in Note 13. Further, the activity related to the accrued tool sets balance is now reported in the Accounts payable and other accrued expenses line on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2023. We reclassified $1.7 million and $2.0 million from Accrued tool sets and other current liabilities to Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated statement of cash flow for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for comparable presentation.\nNote 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Effective in Fiscal 2023\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. This new guidance only applies to contracts and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022. On April 3, 2023, we executed an amendment for our Avondale Term Loan (as defined in Note 14) to convert the stated rate from LIBOR to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (which is further described in Note 14). Additionally, on March 31, 2023, we terminated our existing interest rate swap and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement, effective April 3, 2023, with the Avondale Lender that effectively fixes the interest rate we pay on 50% of the principal amount of the Avondale Term Loan at 1.45% for the entire loan term (which is further described in Note 15). In executing the amendment, we adopted several of the practical expedients allowed under ASU 2020-04, including updating the designated hedged risk in our outstanding cash flow hedging relationship to match the risk presented in the modified interest payments and to continue our hedging relationship that falls within the scope of ASU 2020-04. The adoption of the new guidance in ASU 2020-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNote 4 - Acquisitions\nConcorde Career Colleges\nOn December 1, 2022, we completed the Concorde Acquisition. Concorde operates 17 campuses located in eight states with approximately 7,600 students, and offers its programs via in-person, hybrid and online formats. Concorde offers more than 20 programs across the allied health, dental, nursing, patient care, and diagnostic fields. The acquisition expands our portfolio of offerings into the higher-growth healthcare arena and creates the opportunity to bring workforce educational solutions to a broader array of students and employers.\nUnder the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement), dated May 3, 2022, by and among the Company, Concorde, Liberty Partners Holdings 28, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, and Liberty Investment IIC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (each a Seller, and collectively, the Sellers); and Liberty Partners L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, in its capacity as a representative of the Sellers, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Concorde for a base purchase price of $50.0 million, less $1.9 million of net adjustments including the post-closing working capital adjustment, for total cash consideration paid of $48.1 million. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Concorde is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. We funded the consideration paid for the Concorde Acquisition by the revolving credit facility entered into on November 18, 2022. See Note 14 for further details on the revolving credit facility.\nIn connection with the Concorde Acquisition, we incurred total transaction costs of $5.3 million, of which $3.0 million was incurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 and $2.3 million was incurred during the year ended September 30, 2023. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the applicable period.\nAllocation of the purchase price\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on our preliminary valuation estimates of the fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value and allocation of the business combination are preliminary, are based upon managements best estimates and assumptions, and are subject to future revision. We will continue our analysis under the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which allows companies one year to complete acquisition related adjustments which may result in potential adjustments to the carrying value of the respective recorded assets and liabilities.\nThe preliminary allocation of the purchase price at December 1, 2022 is summarized as follows:\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 30,064\nRestricted cash 1,689\nAccounts receivable, net 6,740\nPrepaid expenses 2,957\nOther current assets 827\nProperty and equipment 23,950\nRight-of-use assets for operating leases 71,153\nGoodwill 11,600\nIntangible assets 5,400\nDeferred tax assets 4,460\nOther assets 4,997\nTotal assets acquired $ 163,837\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nLess: Liabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 15,482\nDeferred revenue 20,145\nOperating lease liability, current portion 10,011\nLong-term debt, current portion (1)\nOther current liabilities 208\nLong-term debt (1)\n5,468\nOperating lease liability 63,582\nTotal liabilities assumed 115,703\nNet assets acquired $ 48,134\n(1) Long-term debt consists of one lease classified as a finance lease under ASC 842.\nDue to the timing of the acquisition, the amounts for income tax liabilities, including deferred income taxes, pending finalization of estimates and assumptions in respect of certain tax aspects of the transaction, are considered preliminary and subject to change. Any changes in the amounts for income tax liabilities could cause further changes to intangible assets and property and equipment.\nThe Company will finalize these amounts no later than one year from the acquisition date once it obtains the information necessary to complete the measurement process. Any changes resulting from facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date may result in adjustments to the preliminary amounts disclosed above which may impact the reported results in the period those adjustments are identified. Since the initial purchase price allocation reported at December 31, 2022, we have adjusted the purchase price allocation for operating and finance lease assets and liabilities due to changes in the incremental borrowing rates. Additionally, we identified further adjustments required for accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, deferred income taxes, deferred revenue, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. The adjustments noted resulted in further changes to both intangible assets and goodwill. Other than an $8.9 million adjustment to operating lease liabilities, the noted adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial statements since the date of acquisition.\nThe amount allocated to goodwill of $11.6 million represents the acquired assembled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include Concordes strategic fit into our growth and diversification strategy, which is focused on offering a broader array of high-quality, in-demand workforce education solutions which both prepare students for a variety of careers in fast-growing fields and help close the country's skills gap by leveraging key industry partnerships.\nThe purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements including the amount of depreciation and amortization expense. The fair value of the property and equipment was estimated using the cost and market approaches as of the valuation date. The fair value of the leases was estimated using the income and market approaches to determine if there was any favorable or unfavorable terms in place.\nThe intangible assets acquired, which primarily consist of the accreditations and regulatory approvals, trademarks and trade names, and curriculum, were valued using different valuation techniques depending upon the nature of the intangible asset acquired, all of which are considered level 3 as defined in Note 8. The accreditations and regulatory approvals were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method (MPEEM) under the income approach. The MPEEM is a variation of discounted cash-flow analysis. Rather than focusing on the whole entity, the MPEEM isolates the cash flows that can be associated with a single intangible asset and measures fair value by discounting them to present value. The trademarks and trade names were valued using the relief from royalty method. The value of the trade name encompasses all items necessary to generate revenue utilizing the trade name. The curriculum was valued using the cost approach.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe table below presents the summary of the intangible assets acquired and the useful lives of these assets based upon the current preliminary purchase price allocation:\nIntangible Asset Useful life Amount\nAccreditations and regulatory approvals Indefinite $ 3,500\nTrademarks and trade names 10 years 500\nCurriculum 5 years 1,400\nTotal $ 5,400\nSee Note 10 and Note 11 and for additional details on goodwill and intangible assets.\nStudent receivables\nWhen financial assets are acquired in connection with a business combination, we evaluate whether those acquired financial assets have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Financial assets acquired with evidence of such credit deterioration are referred to as purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) assets and reflect the acquirers assessment at the acquisition date. The student receivables acquired in the Concorde Acquisition were reviewed to determine if any had experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Student receivables of approximately $2.3 million met the established criteria to indicate a more-than insignificant deterioration in credit quality and were identified as PCD assets. Using our best estimate of projected losses over the term of the contracts, we calculated an allowance for credit losses on these PCD assets of approximately $1.0 million.\nPro forma financial information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes our results of operations as though the acquisition occurred on October 1, 2020:\nTwelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nRevenue $ 643,429 $ 618,949 $ 514,703\nNet income 12,567 27,081 10,108\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets and the finance lease asset had been applied from October 1, 2020, with the related tax effects. The unaudited pro forma financial information also includes adjustments to reflect the additional interest expense on the revolving credit facility issued to fund the acquisition (see Note 14). Lastly, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the reduction in depreciation expense assuming the fair value adjustments to property and equipment assets had been applied from October 1, 2020.\nThis unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only. It does not reflect the integration of the business or any synergies or incremental costs that may result from the acquisition. As such, it is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated on October 1, 2020. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information amounts are not indicative of future operating results.\nMIAT College of Technology\nOn November 1, 2021, using available operating cash, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of MIAT for $26.0 million base purchase price plus $2.8 million working capital surplus for total cash consideration paid of $28.8 million. MIAT is a post-secondary school that offers vocational and technical certificates and degrees across aviation maintenance, energy technology, wind energy technology, robotics and automation, non-destructive testing, heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigeration, and welding disciplines.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nIn connection with this acquisition, we incurred total transaction costs of $1.7 million of which $0.9 million were incurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 and $0.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2021. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the applicable period.\nThe final allocation of the purchase price at November 1, 2021 is summarized as follows:\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,301\nAccounts receivable, net 3,230\nPrepaid expenses 268\nOther current assets 507\nProperty and equipment 3,043\nGoodwill 8,637\nIntangible assets 16,200\nRight-of-use assets for operating leases 14,979\nOther assets 314\nTotal assets acquired $ 49,479\nLess: Liabilities assumed\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 1,720\nDeferred revenue 1,843\nOperating lease liability, current portion 817\nDeferred tax liabilities, net 1,975\nOperating lease liability 14,216\nOther liabilities 93\nTotal liabilities assumed 20,664\nNet assets acquired $ 28,815\nThe goodwill of $8.6 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of the growth and operating synergies expected from integrating MIAT into UTI. The total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $0.6 million. See Note 10 for additional details on goodwill.\nThe accreditations and regulatory approvals were valued using the MPEEM under the income approach. The trademarks and trade names were valued using the relief from royalty method. The curriculum was valued using the cost approach. The table below presents a summary of the intangible assets acquired and the useful lives of these assets:\nIntangible Asset Useful life Amount\nAccreditations and regulatory approvals Indefinite $ 12,800\nTrademarks and trade names (1)\nIndefinite 3,000\nCurriculum 5 years 400\nTotal $ 16,200\n(1) During the fourth quarter of 2022, in conjunction with our growth and diversification initiatives, we completed a branding study and determined that the useful life of the MIAT trademarks and trade name was no longer indefinite, and a four-year finite useful life was more appropriate. We completed the required impairment testing when changing from an indefinite to a finite useful life for an intangible asset and determined that the carrying value of the MIAT trademarks\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nand trade name exceeded its fair value. We determined the fair value of intangible asset to be $1.0 million as of September 30, 2022 using the relief from royalty method and recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $2.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nPro forma financial information is not presented as revenues and earnings of MIAT were not material to our consolidated statements of operations. MIAT is included in the UTI reportable segment disclosed in Note 22 on Segments.\nNote 5 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nNature of Goods and Services\nAs previously described in Note 2, revenues across the UTI and Concorde segments consist primarily of student tuition and fees derived from the programs we provide after reductions are made for discounts and scholarships that we sponsor and for refunds for students who withdraw from our programs prior to specified dates. We apply the five-step model outlined in ASC 606. Tuition and fee revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the course or program offered.\nThe majority of the UTI programs are designed to be completed in 30 to 100 weeks. The UTI advanced training programs range from 8 to 26 weeks in duration. UTI also provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers. Revenues are recognized as transfer of the services occurs.\nThe majority of Concordes core programs are nine to ten months in duration and are billed in full at the start of the program. Clinical programs are 12 to 24 month programs that are billed by academic term. Clinical programs may have up to nine academic terms that last two to three months each. Revenues are recognized as transfer of the services occurs.\nIn addition to revenue from tuition and fees, UTI and Concorde derive supplemental revenues from sales of textbooks and program supplies and other revenues, which are recognized as the transfer of goods or services occurs. Deferred revenue represents the excess of tuition and fee payments received as compared to tuition and fees earned and is reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets because it is expected to be earned within the next 12 months.\nAll of our revenues are generated within the United States. The impact of economic factors on the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows is consistent across our various programs for both the UTI and Concorde segments. See Note 22 for disaggregated segment revenue information.\nRevenues from our Proprietary Loan Program\nAs previously described in Note 2, certain UTI students participate in a proprietary loan program that extends repayment terms for their tuition beyond the time that they are in school. We purchase said loans from the lender. Based on historical collection rates, we believe at least a portion of these loans are collectible. Accordingly, we recognize tuition and loan origination fees financed by the loan and any related interest revenue under the effective interest method required under the loan based on the amount we expect to collect, and we recognize these revenues ratably over the term of the course or program offered.\nContract Balances\nContract assets primarily relate to our rights to consideration for a students progress through our training program in relation to our services performed but not billed at the reporting date. The contract assets are transferred to the receivables when the rights become unconditional. Currently, we do not have any contract assets that have not transferred to a receivable. Our deferred revenue is considered a contract liability and primarily relates to our enrollment agreements where we received payments for tuition but we have not yet delivered the related training programs to satisfying the related performance obligations. The advance consideration received from students or Title IV funding is deferred revenue until the training program has been delivered to the students.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe following table provides information about receivables and deferred revenue resulting from our enrollment agreements with students:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nReceivables (1)\n$ 59,863 $ 46,826\nDeferred revenue $ 85,738 $ 54,223\n(1) Receivables, net of allowances, includes tuition receivables, retail installment contract receivables and notes receivable, both current and long term.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the deferred revenue balance included decreases for revenues recognized during the period, increases related to new students who started their training programs during the period, and the addition of\ndeferred revenue from the Concorde Acquisition.\nNote 6 - Receivables, net\nReceivables, net consist of the following:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nTuition and fees receivables $ 29,616 $ 18,931\nTax receivables 740 -\nOther receivables 3,858 3,153\nTotal receivables 34,214 22,084\nLess: allowance for uncollectible accounts (9,053) (5,634)\nReceivables, net $ 25,161 $ 16,450\nThe allowance for uncollectible accounts is estimated using our historical write-off experience applied to the receivable balances for students who are no longer attending school due to graduation or withdrawal or who are in school and have receivable balances in excess of financial aid available to them.

We had the ability and intention to hold these investments until maturity and therefore classified these investments as held-to-maturity and recorded them at amortized cost and presented them in Held-to-maturity investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, there were no outstanding held-to-maturity investments as all of the securities matured by December 31, 2022 and there were no new purchases of held-to-maturity investments during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe amortized cost, gross unrealized gains or losses, and fair value of held-to-maturity investments at September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nGross Unrealized Estimated Fair\nDue in less than 1 year: Amortized Cost Gains Losses Market Value\nCorporate, municipal bonds and other $ 28,918 $ - $ (19) $ 28,899\nInvestments are exposed to various risks, including interest rate, market and credit risk. As a result, it is possible that changes in the values of these investments may occur and that such changes could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.\nNote 8 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe accounting framework for determining fair value includes a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to measure fair value, which enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements. The fair value hierarchy consists of three tiers:\nLevel 1: Defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nAny transfers of investments between levels occurs at the end of the reporting period. Assets measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following:\nFair Value Measurements Using\nSeptember 30, 2023 Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nMoney market funds(1)\n$ 29,687 $ 29,687 $ - $ -\nNotes receivable(2)\n36,663 - - 36,663\nTotal assets at fair value on a recurring basis $ 66,350 $ 29,687 $ - $ 36,663\nRevolving credit facility and term loans (4)\n156,991 - 156,991 -\nTotal liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis $ 156,991 $ - $ 156,991 $ -\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

The remaining weighted average useful lives shown are calculated based on the net book value and remaining amortization period of each respective intangible asset. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment as of August 1, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. There were no indicators of impairment for our indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the year ended September 30, 2023. As discussed in Note 4, during the year ended September 30, 2022, we determined the fair value of our MIAT trademarks and trade names intangible asset to be $1.0 million and recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $2.0 million within Selling, general and administrative on the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nNote 12 - Leases\nAs of September 30, 2023, we lease 29 of our 33 campuses and three other locations under non-cancelable operating leases, some of which contain escalation clauses and requirements to pay other fees associated with the leases. Our facility leases have original lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years and expire at various dates through 2036. In addition, the leases commonly include lease incentives in the form of rent abatements and tenant improvement allowances. We sublease certain portions of unused building space to third parties, which as of September 30, 2023, resulted in minimal income. All of the leases, other than those that may qualify for the short-term scope exception of 12 months or less, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSome of the facility leases are subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes to the CPI, changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. Many of our lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which we do not include in our minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. There are no early termination with penalties, residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants imposed by our facility leases.\nThe components of lease expense are included in Educational services and facilities and Selling, general and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations, with the exception of interest on lease liabilities, which is included in Interest expense.\nThe components of lease expense during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are presented below. The operating lease expense excludes expense for short-term leases not accounted for under ASC 842, which was not significant for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nYear ended September 30,\nLease Expense 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease expense $ 29,450 $ 22,424 $ 22,623\nFinance lease expense:\nAmortization of leased assets 779 72 123\nInterest on lease liabilities 296 2 6\nVariable lease expense 8,725 5,469 3,682\nSublease income (114) (155) (444)\nTotal net lease expense $ 39,136 $ 27,812 $ 25,990\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

This increase was partially offset in March 2023, with the purchase of the three primary buildings and associated land that we previously leased at the UTI Orlando, Florida campus, as discussed in Note 9. This purchase reduced our right-of-use assets balance by approximately $10.5 million and our operating lease liabilities by approximately $12.4 million.\n(2) The finance lease assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 consisted of one campus lease, and as of September 30, 2022 were made up of three equipment leases.

The Credit Facility has a term of three years, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the credit agreement.\nThis agreement provides that borrowings under the Credit Facility will amortize on an interest-only basis during its term with principal able to be borrowed, re-paid and re-borrowed throughout the term of the Credit Facility and with the outstanding principal due and payable at maturity. Advances made under the Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a variable rate equal to the greater of: (i) 3.50%, or (ii) the rate that the lender publicly announces, publishes or designates from time to time as its index rate or prime rate, or any successor rate thereto, in effect at its principal office, or (b) a variable rate equal to the greater of (i) 0%, or (ii) Term SOFR relating to quotations for one (1) or three (3) months, as selected by us or as otherwise set pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, as applicable, plus, in the case of any Term SOFR loan, an adjustment equal to 0.10% if the interest period is one (1) month and 0.15% if the interest period is three (3) months. Interest in the case of tranche rate loans will be increased by an applicable margin that varies from 1.75% up to 2.25% based on our then-current total leverage ratio. In executing the Credit Facility, we incurred $0.5 million in debt issuance costs which have been recorded in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2023. On November 28, 2022, we drew $90.0 million from the Credit Facility in support of the closing of the Concorde Acquisition. In December 2022, a $1.8 million letter of credit was issued on the Credit Facility. The remaining availability under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2023 was $8.2 million.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nWe are also subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants under the credit agreement, including financial covenants such as total leverage ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a quick ratio. In addition, we are required to maintain a financial responsibility composite score of at least 1.4 as of the end of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 and of at least 1.5 as of the end of any fiscal year thereafter. On August 23, 2023 the Credit Facility was amended to remove the clean off provision, under which the amount outstanding on the Credit Facility was not to exceed $20.0 million for a single 30 consecutive day period from our initial draw and ending on December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility.\nAvondale Term Loan\nIn connection with the Avondale, Arizona building purchase in December 2020, we entered into a credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, national banking association (the Avondale Lender) on May 12, 2021 in the maximum principal amount of $31.2 million with a maturity of seven years (the Avondale Term Loan). Originally, the Avondale Term Loan bore interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%. On April 3, 2023 in connection with applying the guidance in ASU 2020-04, we executed an amendment for our Avondale Term Loan to convert the stated rate from LIBOR to Term SOFR. As of April 3, 2023, the Avondale Term Loan bears interest at the rate of Term SOFR plus 2.0% and a tranche rate adjustment of 0.046%. Principal and interest payments are due monthly. The Avondale Term Loan is secured by a first priority lien on our Avondale, Arizona property, including all land and improvements. Additionally, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the Avondale Lender. See Note 15 below for further discussion on the interest rate swap.\nWe are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants under the Credit Agreement, including, without limitation, certain reporting obligations and certain limitations on restricted payments, and limitations on liens, encumbrances and indebtedness. The Term Loan is also subject to certain financial maintenance covenants. The debt service coverage ratio shall not be less than 1.25 to 1.00 and is defined as the ratio of the sum of consolidated income (loss) for the year, to the extent deducted in determining income for such period, before income taxes, interest expense, amortization, depreciation and other non-cash charges including net stock-based compensation, fees and expenses related to potential acquisitions and expansion of operations and certain non-recurring charges, including relating to restructuring, business optimization and diversification strategy, less any extraordinary non-recurring gains, interest income and non-cash gains (Consolidated EBITDA) (less dividends payable on our Series A Preferred Stock) and other extraordinary items to the current portion of long-term debt and interest paid during the period being measured. The funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio is required to be no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. Beginning on May 12, 2024, the Lender may request new appraisals of the Avondale property in order to maintain the ratio of the amortized loan balance to the value of the location at 70%, the approximate ratio that existed at May 12, 2021. Events of default under the Credit Agreement include, among others, the failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants (including certain financial maintenance covenants) and breach of representations or warranties. If we fail to meet the minimum debt service coverage ratio, loan-to-value or debt yield and fail to cure such non-compliance within a time period acceptable to the Lender, we will be in default. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the debt covenants for the Avondale Term Loan.\nLisle Term Loan\nOn April 14, 2022, our consolidated subsidiary, 2611 Corporate West Drive Venture LLC (the Borrower), entered into a new Loan Agreement (Lisle Loan Agreement) with Valley National Bank (the Lisle Lender), to fund the acquisition and retire the prior loan agreement with Western Alliance bank, via a term loan in the original principal amount of $38.0 million with a maturity of seven years (the Lisle Term Loan). The Lisle Term Loan bears interest at a rate of one-month Term SOFR plus 2.0%. The Lisle Term Loan is secured by a mortgage on the Lisle, Illinois campus and is guaranteed by the Company. In connection with the Lisle Term Loan, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement. See Note 15 below for further discussion on the interest rate swap.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nAs guarantor, the Company is subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants under the Lisle Loan Agreement - VN, including, without limitation, reporting and notice obligations and certain financial maintenance covenants. The Companys fixed charge coverage ratio is required to be not less than 1.25 to 1.00 during the period being measured and is defined as the ratio of (a) the sum of consolidated net income (loss) for the year, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other extraordinary non-recurring items (Adjusted EBITDA) plus rent paid to Borrower and less cash taxes paid, distributions, and unfinanced capital expenditures to (b) principal and interest expenses plus rent paid to Borrower. The ratio of total indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA is required to be no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, the Borrowers debt service coverage ratio is required to equal or exceed 1.20 to 1.00 during the period being measured and is defined as the ratio of (a) net operating income of the Lisle Campus to (b) actual annual debt service due under the Loan Agreement. Events of default under the Loan Agreement include, among others, the failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants (including certain financial maintenance covenants) and breach of representations or warranties. If the Company fails to meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or ratio of total indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA and fails to cure such non-compliance within a time period acceptable to the Lender, the Company will be in default. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with the debt covenants for the Lisle Term Loan.\nDebt Maturities\nScheduled principal payments due on our debt for each year through the period ended September 30, 2028, and thereafter were as follows at September 30, 2023:\nMaturity Revolving Credit Facility & Term Loans Finance Leases Total\n2024 $ 1,673 $ 844 $ 2,517\n2025 1,763 932 2,695\n2026 91,836 1,027 92,863\n2027 1,909 1,128 3,037\n2028 26,610 1,237 27,847\nThereafter 33,200 433 33,633\nSubtotal 156,991 5,601 162,592\nDebt issuance costs presented with debt (475) - (475)\nTotal $ 156,516 $ 5,601 $ 162,117\nNote 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates. We may enter into derivative financial instruments to offset these underlying market risks. See Note 2 for our derivative financial instruments policy.\nOn May 12, 2021, in connection with the Avondale Term Loan discussed in Note 14, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the Lender that effectively fixes the interest rate on 50% of the principal amount of the Avondale Term Loan, or approximately $15.6 million, at 3.5% for the entire loan term, or seven years (the Avondale Swap). On May 12, 2021, the Avondale Swap was designated as an effective cash flow hedge for accounting and tax purposes. On March 31, 2023 in connection with applying the guidance in ASU 2020-04, we terminated our existing interest rate swap and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement, effective April 3, 2023, with the Avondale Lender that effectively fixes the interest rate we pay on 50% of the principal amount of the Avondale Term Loan at 1.45% for the entire loan term. Further, the floating rate we receive under this new swap has been converted to one month Term SOFR, versus one month LIBOR under the previous swap. In executing the amendment, we adopted several of the practical expedients allowed under ASU 2020-04, including updating the designated hedged risk in our outstanding cash flow hedging relationship to match the risk presented in the modified interest payments and to continue our hedging relationship that falls within the scope of ASU 2020-04. The adoption of the new guidance in ASU 2020-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and the Avondale Swap is still designated as an effective cash flow hedge for accounting and tax purposes.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nOn April 14, 2022, in connection with the Lisle Term loan described in Note 14, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the Lisle Lender that effectively fixes the interest rate on 50% of the principal amount of the Lisle Term Loan at 4.69% for the entire loan term, or seven years (the Lisle Swap). On April 14, 2022, the Lisle Swap was designated as an effective cash flow hedge for accounting and tax purposes.\nOf the net amount of the existing gains that are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2023, we estimate that $1.0 million will be reclassified to Interest expense within the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Avondale Swap and Lisle Swap were approximately $14.6 million and $18.9 million, respectively.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nThe following table presents the fair value of our Avondale Swap and Lisle Swap (Level 2), both of which are designated as cash flow hedges, and the related classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSeptember 30,\nInterest Rate Swaps 2023 2022\nOther current assets $ 957 $ 632\nOther assets 2,075 2,067\nTotal fair value of assets designated as hedging instruments $ 3,032 $ 2,699\nEffect of Cash Flow Hedge Accounting on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe table below presents the effect of cash flow hedge accounting for our Avondale Swap and Lisle Swap on the consolidated statements of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on Derivative Amount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) into Income\nYear Ended September 30, 2023\nAvondale and Lisle Swaps $ (1,169) $ (835)\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nAvondale and Lisle Swaps $ 2,787 $ (192)\nYear Ended September 30, 2021\nAvondale Swap $ (365) $ (86)\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

The change in valuation allowance during the year is primarily a result of purchase accounting in conjunction with the Concorde acquisition. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain federal and state attributes for which we determined that it was more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized prior to expiration. In assessing whether a valuation allowance was required, we considered the weight of all available positive and negative evidence.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $25.8 million and $92.3 million in net operating losses for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely, while the state net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning 2023 through 2043 if not utilized or carried forward indefinitely. Additionally, we had $0.4 million of federal research and development tax credits under Internal Revenue Code \u00a741 and other general business tax credits. If unused, these credits begin to expire in 2038.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the gross unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 387 $ -\nIncreases relates to current year tax positions 109\nIncreases related to acquisitions - 387\nBalance at end of period $ 496 $ 387\nThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $0.5 million as of September 30, 2023, of which $0.4 million, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. The current year increase relates to research and development tax credits generated in the current year.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits through income tax expense. No interest or penalties were accrued as of September 30, 2023. We do not expect a significant decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\nWe file income tax returns for federal purposes and in many states. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for certain length of time, generally three to four years, following the tax year to which these filings relate. In 2020, we filed returns to carried back federal and certain state net operating losses to prior years. The statute of limitations for adjustment of the net operating losses utilized on these tax returns remains open an additional three to four years, depending on jurisdiction, from the date these returns were filed.\nNote 17 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLicensing Agreements\nWe have entered into various licensing agreements with varying expiration dates that give us the right to use certain materials, trademarks, trade names, trade dress, and other intellectual property in connection with the operation of our campuses and the development of our courses. The expense for the license fees under these various agreements totaled $2.3 million, $2.1 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were recorded in Educational services and facilities expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nSnap-on Tools Product Support Agreement\nIn February 2023, UTI entered into a new agreement with Snap-on Industrial (Snap-on Tools), as a result of the expiration of the previous agreement, that allows UTI to purchase promotional tool kits for its students at a discount from the list price (see below paragraph). In addition, UTI earns credits that are redeemable for Snap-on Tools equipment that is utilized in UTI training programs. Credits are earned on UTIs purchases as well as purchases made by students enrolled in the UTI programs. As part of the agreement, UTI has agreed to grant Snap-on Tools exclusive access to its campuses, to display\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nadvertising and primarily use their tools to train UTI students. Additionally, per the new agreement, UTI receives a quarterly product donation allowance towards the purchase of tools and equipment which are to be utilized in the UTI training programs at its campuses. The credits and allowances under this agreement may be redeemed in multiple ways. This agreement will expire in December 2027. A net prepaid expense with Snap-on Tools has resulted from an excess of credits earned over credits used of $1.9 million and $4.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, included in Other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nUTI students are provided a Career Starter Tool Set Voucher which can be redeemed for a tool set near graduation. The cost of the tool sets, net of the discount, is accrued during the time period in which the UTI students begin attending school until they have progressed to the point that the promotional tool set vouchers are provided. The consolidated balance sheets include a liability in Accounts payable and accrued expenses for the tool sets that are expected to be redeemed of $4.1 million and $3.2 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, UTIs liability to Snap-on Tools for vouchers redeemed by students was $0.5 million and $2.3 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSurety Bonds\nEach of our campuses must be authorized by the applicable state education agency in which the campus is located to operate and to grant certificates, diplomas or degrees to its students. Our campuses are subject to extensive, ongoing regulation by each of these states. Additionally, our campuses are required to be authorized by the applicable state education agencies of certain other states in which our campuses recruit students. Our insurers issue surety bonds for us on behalf of our campuses and admissions representatives with multiple states to maintain authorization to conduct our business. We are obligated to reimburse our insurers for any surety bonds that are paid by the insurers. As of September 30, 2023, the total face amount of these surety bonds was approximately $22.3 million.\nLegal\nIn the ordinary conduct of our business, we are periodically subject to lawsuits, demands in arbitration, investigations, regulatory proceedings or other claims, including, but not limited to, claims involving current or former students, routine employment matters, business disputes and regulatory demands. When we are aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the loss. When a loss is not both probable and estimable, we do not accrue a liability. Where a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible, including if a loss in excess of an accrued liability is reasonably possible, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claims. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, but note that legal proceedings could, generally, have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.\nNote 18 - Shareholders Equity\nCommon Stock\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors and have the right to one vote per share on all matters requiring shareholder approval. On June 9, 2016, our Board of Directors voted to eliminate the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. Any future common stock dividends require the approval of a majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nPreferred Stock\nPreferred Stock consists of 10,000,000 authorized preferred shares of $0.0001 par value each. On June 24, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Coliseum Holdings I, LLC (Purchaser) to sell to the Purchaser 700,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) for a total purchase price of $70.0 million. The Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual, and therefore does not have a maturity date.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, 675,885 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. The liquidation preference associated with the Series A Preferred Stock was $100 per share at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe description below provides a summary of certain material terms of the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nRank\nThe Series A Preferred Stock will, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, rank senior to our common stock and each other junior class or series of shares that we may issue in the future. The Series A Preferred Stock will also rank junior to any future indebtedness.\nDividends\nWe may pay a cash dividend on each share of the Series A Preferred Stock at a rate of 7.5% per year on the liquidation preference then in effect (Cash Dividend). The Cash Dividend is payable before any dividends would be declared or paid to common stockholders or other junior stockholders. If we do not pay a Cash Dividend, the liquidation preference shall be increased to an amount equal to the current liquidation preference in effect plus an amount reflecting that liquidation preference multiplied by the Cash Dividend rate then in effect plus 2.0% per year (Accrued Dividend). Cash Dividends are payable semi-annually in arrears on September 30 and March 31 of each year, and will begin to accrue on the first day of the applicable dividend period. We paid Cash Dividends of $5.1 million and $5.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock includes participation rights such that, in the event that we pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding common stock, we shall also pay to each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock a dividend on an as converted basis.\nIf we are required to or elect to obtain stockholder and regulatory approval and if such approval is not obtained within the time periods set forth in the Certificate, the dividend rates with respect to the Cash Dividend and Accrued Dividend will be increased by 5.0% per year, not to exceed a maximum of 14.5% per year, subject to downward adjustment on obtaining the foregoing approvals.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, before any distribution or payment to the holders of any common or junior stock, an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the liquidation preference then in effect, which would include any Accrued Dividends. Alternatively, the holder may choose to receive the amount that would be payable per share of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such liquidation event.\nMergers (regardless of whether we remain the surviving entity), sale of substantially all of our assets or any other recapitalization, reclassification or other transaction in which substantially all of our common stock is exchanged or converted into cash or other property are considered Deemed Liquidation Events. The Certificate of Designations provides that, in the case of a Deemed Liquidation Event, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the liquidation amount they would receive under a normal liquidation event; however, the liquidation amount must be in the same form of consideration as is payable to the holders of our common stock.\nThe liquidation preference associated with the Series A Preferred Stock was $100 per share at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nVoting\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock on an as converted basis, subject to the Continuing Caps as discussed below.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nA majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock must approve certain significant actions, including, without limitation, the issuance of certain equity securities; the repurchase, redemption or acquisition of our common stock; the incurrence of debt; the consummation of certain acquisitions, mergers or other such transactions; and the sale of material assets.\nThe Certificate of Designations includes a Conversion Cap and an Investor Voting Cap (each as defined in the Certificate of Designations), which generally prohibit: (i) the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock; and (ii) the voting of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that such conversion results in the issuance of a number of shares of common stock exceeding 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of June 24, 2016 or that has voting power that exceeds 4.99% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock as of June 24, 2016.\nThe Certificate of Designations provides that the Conversion Cap and the Investor Voting Cap may only be removed upon our receipt of: (i) certain stockholder approvals required by Section 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (NYSE Rule 312); and (ii) either (A) Education Regulatory Approval (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or (B) a good faith determination by our board of directors that Education Regulatory Approval is not required. Our stockholders approved a proposal at the annual meeting of stockholders on February 27, 2020, in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE, that satisfied NYSE Rule 312.\nIn August 2020, the Purchaser notified us that it intended to distribute all 700,000 Series A Preferred Stock to its members, and that certain of its members would subsequently distribute their Series A Preferred Stock to (i) limited partners affiliated with the Purchaser and certain other entities for whom Coliseum Capital Management, LLC (an affiliate of the Purchaser) holds voting and dispositive power with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (the Affiliated Holders), which six Affiliated Holders, following such distribution, will own Series A Preferred Stock that would represent, on an as converted basis, approximately 24.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock and voting power, and (ii) limited partners unaffiliated with the Purchaser (the Unaffiliated Holders), which 12 Unaffiliated Holders, following such distribution, each will own Series A Preferred Stock that would represent, on an as converted basis, 9.9% or less of our outstanding shares of common stock and voting power (collectively, the Distributions).\nIn connection with the Distributions, our board of directors, based on advice of legal counsel, determined that: (i) no Education Regulatory Approval would be required for the Unaffiliated Holders to remove the Conversion Cap and the Investor Voting Cap with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock acquired in the Distributions; and (ii) as to the Series A Preferred Stock held by the Affiliated Holders, no Education Regulatory Approval is required prior to the Affiliated Holders (A) converting a number of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock provided that the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such conversion, in the aggregate, is less than or equal to 9.9% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on an as converted basis as of the date of the Distributions, and (B) voting a number of Series A Preferred Stock provided that the voting power of such Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock is less than or equal to 9.9% of the voting power of the common stock outstanding as of the date of the Distributions (the foregoing limitations, the Continuing Caps).\nThe removal of the Conversion Cap and Voting Cap became effective as of the date of the Distributions, subject to the Continuing Caps remaining in place with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock distributed to the Affiliated Holders. Education Regulatory Approval continue to be required for, and the Continuing Caps will remain in place with respect to, the Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the Affiliated Holders in the Distributions to the extent such shares, on an as converted basis, represent in excess of 9.9% of our common stock and voting power as of the date of the Distributions. The Affiliated Holders may, at any time, request that we seek Education Regulatory Approval or make a good faith determination that such approval is not required.\nOptional Conversion by Purchaser\nThe Series A Preferred Stock are convertible to common stock at any time at the option of the holder. Following the Distributions, the Conversion Cap currently applies to the Affiliated Holders.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nOptional Conversion by Our Company\nIf at any time following the third anniversary of the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the volume weighted average price of our common stock equals or exceeds 2.5 times the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock, or $8.33 as of September 30, 2023, for a period of 20 consecutive trading days during an open trading window (Conversion Trigger), we may, at our option and subject to obtaining any required stockholder and regulatory approvals, require that any or all of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock be automatically converted into our common stock at the conversion rate. We may not elect such conversion during the closed trading window periods in which any director or executive officer of our company is prohibited by us to, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer any equity security of our company. If we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to remove the Conversion Cap within 120 days of giving our notice of intent to convert, we will have the option to redeem all of the Series A Preferred Stock at a premium.\nConversion Rate and Conversion Price\nThe conversion rate for the Series A Preferred Stock will be calculated by dividing the current liquidation preference by the conversion price then in effect. The initial and current conversion price for the Series A Preferred Stock is $3.33 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain common stock events, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, including stock splits, reverse stock splits or the issuance of common stock dividends.\nOptional Special Dividend and Conversion on Certain Change of Control\nUpon a change of control, at the written election by holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, we shall declare and pay a special cash dividend in the amount equal to either 1.5 or 2.0 times the Cash Dividend rate, depending on the type of change in control, multiplied by the liquidation preference per share then in effect.\nRedemption at the Option of Our Company\nWe have the ability to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at any time after the third anniversary of the issue date, provided that the Conversion Trigger has not been met on the date of the redemption notice. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be able to convert their shares into common stock if neither the Investor Voting Cap nor Conversion Cap is in effect. If they do not provide notice of conversion within 10 days of receipt of the redemption notice, the redemption will proceed at a price per share equal to the product of the current conversion rate and 2.5 times the conversion price. If either the Investor Voting Cap or Conversion Cap is in effect at the date of the notice of redemption, the holder may request that we obtain the necessary regulatory approval for its removal.\nAfter the tenth anniversary of the issue date, we have the ability to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or in part at any time. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will then be able to convert their shares into common stock if neither the Investor Voting Cap nor Conversion Cap is in effect. If they do not provide notice of conversion within 10 days of receipt of the redemption notice, the redemption will proceed at a price per share equal to the current liquidation preference. If either the Investor Voting Cap or Conversion Cap is in effect at the date of the notice of redemption, the holder may request that we obtain the necessary regulatory approval for its removal.\nAnti-dilution\nThe conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to certain customary anti-dilution protections should we effect certain common stock events, such as stock splits, stock dividends or subdivisions, reclassifications or combinations of our common stock. In such events, the conversion price will be adjusted in a proportionate manner to the change in outstanding share of common stock immediately preceding and immediately after the event.\nReservation of Shares Issuable upon Conversion\nWe are required, at all times, to reserve and keep available out of our authorized and unissued shares of common stock the number of shares that would be issuable upon conversion of all Series A Preferred Stock, assuming that the Conversion Cap does not apply. If this reserve is not sufficient at any point to allow for full conversion, we shall be required to take action to increase our pool of authorized but unissued shares.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nUnder the Securities Act, we were not required to register the offer or sale of the Series A Preferred Stock to the Purchaser. In conjunction with the Purchase Agreement, the parties entered into a Registration Rights Agreement in order to grant the Purchaser certain demand and piggyback registration rights covering the purchased shares. In the event that the Purchaser requests such registration of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Registration Rights agreement provides that we shall bear all expenses associated with the registration, with the exception of underwriting discounts and commissions and brokerage fees. On October 18, 2019, we filed a Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register shares of common stock currently held by selling stockholders as well as shares of common stock issuable upon the optional conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by the selling stockholders. That registration statement became effective on October 30, 2019.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn December 10, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan that would allow for the repurchase of up to $35.0 million of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. This new share\nrepurchase plan replaced the previously authorized plan from fiscal 2012. Any repurchases under this new stock repurchase program require the approval of a majority of the voting power of our Series A Preferred Stock. We did not repurchase any\nshares during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 19 - Stock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation is governed by the 2021 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (2021 Plan). The 2021 Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors in January 2021 and approved by our shareholders at the February 2021 annual meeting. The 2021 Plan replaced the Management 2002 Stock Option Program and the 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the Former Plans). Under the 2021 Plan, we are authorized to issue incentive compensation convertible into up to 2.0 million shares of common stock, increased by 0.7 million shares that remained available for future grants of awards under the Former Plans immediately prior to termination. Additionally, subject to and in accordance with the 2021 Plan, 1.5 million shares that are subject to outstanding awards under the Former Plans that are subsequently expired, forfeited, or are otherwise terminated will also become available for awards under the 2021 Plan. As of September 30, 2023, 1.1 million shares remained available for future grants under the 2021 Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nAs previously discussed in Note 2, compensation expense associated with RSUs, PSUs or stock options is measured based on the grant date fair value of our common stock. The fair value of the RSUs is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of the PSUs is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon the fair market value on the date of grant, adjusted quarterly for the anticipated or actual achievement against the established performance condition.\nFor all stock-based compensation expense, we account for forfeitures as they occur. The following table summarizes the operating expense line in which stock-based compensation expense has been recorded and the impact on net income in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nEducational services and facilities $ 192 $ 240 $ 60\nSelling, general and administrative 3,656 4,172 1,748\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 3,848 $ 4,412 $ 1,808\nIncome tax benefit $ 962 $ 1,103 $ 452\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

Under the 2021 Plan, the maximum term of any option granted is ten years and, unless otherwise permitted by our Compensation Committee, an option generally will remain exercisable for three months following the participants termination of service, provided that if service terminates as a result of the participants death or disability, the option generally will remain exercisable for 12 months, but in any event the option must be exercised no later than its expiration date.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity under the Former Plans and the 2021 Plan for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nNumber of\nShares Weighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(In thousands) (per Share) (Years) (In thousands)\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2021 210 $ 3.14 4.18 $ 760\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2022 210 $ 3.14 3.18 $ 483\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023 210 $ 3.14 2.18 $ 1,100\nStock options exercisable as of September 30, 2023 210 $ 3.14 2.18 $ 1,100\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Units\nRestricted Stock Units\nOur RSUs are issued at fair market value, which is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. RSUs generally vest ratably over a three-year service period from the date of grant. As of September 30, 2023, unrecognized stock compensation expense related to RSUs was $4.0 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.\nPerformance Share Units\nOur outstanding PSUs vest over a three-year service period from the date of the grant and are based upon a mix of certain pre-established targets for revenue, compounded annual total shareholder return for the measurement period and net income. On the settlement date for each measurement period, participants will receive shares of our common stock equal to 0% to 187.5% of the PSUs originally granted depending on the actual achievement against the performance metrics for that measurement period. The PSUs vest subject to a market condition and on the settlement date which is expected to be no later than two and a half months after the end of each measurement period. As of September 30, 2023, unrecognized stock compensation expense related to PSUs was $3.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

Our Series A Preferred Stock is considered a participating security because, in the event that we pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding common stock, we shall also pay each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock a dividend on an as-converted basis. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for common stock and participating securities according to dividend and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method, all earnings, distributed and undistributed, are allocated to common shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. The Series A Preferred Stock is not included in the computation of basic EPS in periods in which we have a net loss, as the Series A Preferred Stock is not contractually obligated to share in our net losses.\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class method or as-converted method. The two-class method uses net income available to common shareholders and assumes conversion of all potential shares other than the participating securities. The as-converted method uses net income and assumes conversion of all potential shares including the participating securities. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance units and convertible preferred stock.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

The plan provides for matching a portion of employees contributions at managements discretion. We made matching contributions of approximately $1.7 million, $1.5 million, and $1.1 million to the 401(k) plan for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAdditionally, we have a legacy deferred compensation plan into which certain members of management were eligible to defer a maximum of 75% of their regular compensation and a maximum of 100% of their incentive compensation. No new\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nmembers have been added to the deferred compensation plan in the past three years. We are not obligated to fund the deferred compensation plan; however, we have purchased life insurance policies on the participants in order to fund the related benefits and such policies have been placed into a rabbi trust. Our obligations under the deferred compensation plan totaled $2.2 million and $2.2 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in Other liabilities while the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies totaled $2.8 million and $2.6 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 22 - Segment Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, and in conjunction with the Concorde Acquisition, we revised our reportable segments to reflect the manner in which Jerome Grant, our CEO and the chief operating decision-maker, evaluates performance and allocates resources. These segments are organized by key market segments to enhance operational alignment within each segment to more effectively execute our strategic plan. We have two reportable segments as follows:\nUTI: UTI operates 16 campuses located in 9 states and offers a wide range of degree and non-degree transportation and skilled trades technical training programs under brands such as Universal Technical Institute, Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, Marine Mechanics Institute, NASCAR Technical Institute, and MIAT. UTI also offers manufacturer specific advanced training programs, which include student-paid electives, at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at certain campuses and dedicated training centers. Lastly, UTI provides dealer technician training or instructor staffing services to manufacturers.\nConcorde: Concorde operates 17 campuses located in 8 states and online, offering degree, non-degree and continuing education programs in the allied health, dental, nursing, patient care and diagnostic fields. Concorde believes in preparing students for their healthcare careers with practical, hands-on experiences including opportunities to learn while providing care to real patients. Prior to graduation, students will complete a number of hours in a clinical setting or externship, depending upon their program of study.\nCorporate includes corporate related expenses that are not allocated to the UTI or Concorde reportable segments and is included to reconcile segment results to the consolidated financial statements. In prior years, these costs were allocated across our former Postsecondary Education reportable segment and Other category based upon compensation expense. Prior periods have been updated to conform to the revised presentation.\nSummary information by reportable segment is as follows:\nUTI Concorde Corporate Consolidated\nYear Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues $ 429,317 $ 178,091 $ - $ 607,408\nIncome (loss) from operations 55,679 10,533 (44,813) 21,399\nDepreciation and amortization 21,113 4,077 25 25,215\nNet income (loss) 51,241 10,700 (49,619) 12,322\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nRevenues $ 418,765 $ - $ - $ 418,765\nIncome (loss) from operations 64,371 - (41,997) 22,374\nDepreciation and amortization 16,822 - 62 16,884\nNet income (loss) 62,459 - (36,611) 25,848\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC.

These requirements, which are frequently being revisited, revised, and expanded, cover virtually every aspect of our schools operations, and our institutions are subject to periodic audits and program compliance reviews by various external agencies for compliance with these requirements. Each of our institutions administration of the federal programs of student financial assistance under Title IV of the HEA (Title IV Programs) also must be audited annually by independent accountants and the resulting audit report submitted to ED for review. The approvals granted by these regulatory entities permit our schools to operate and to participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs, including Title IV Programs. If our institutions fail to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, our regulators could take an array of adverse actions, up to and including revocation of the approval granted by the agency. Such adverse actions could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Below, we discuss certain, specific elements of this regulatory environment.\nState Authorization\nTo operate and offer postsecondary programs, and to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs, each of our institutions must obtain and maintain authorization from the state in which it is physically located (Home State). To engage in educational or recruiting activities outside of its Home State, each institution also may be required to obtain and maintain authorization from the states in which it is educating or recruiting students. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state and is extensive in some states. State laws may establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and equipment, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, student outcomes reporting, disclosure obligations to students, limitations on mandatory arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe standards of financial responsibility and mandate that institutions post surety bonds. Many states have requirements for institutions to disclose institutional data to current and prospective students, as well as to the public, and some states require that our schools meet prescribed performance standards as a condition of continued approval. States can and often do revisit, revise, and expand their regulations governing postsecondary education and recruiting.\nInstitutions that offer instruction outside of their Home State must comply with federal regulations governing state authorization for distance education in order to participate in the Title IV student financial aid programs. All UTI institutions and the Concorde, Kansas City and Memphis institutions are authorized to participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories of the United States of America that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of post-secondary distance education courses and programs. SARA is overseen by a national council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts. Forty-nine states (all but California), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have joined SARA.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nEach of our institutions holds the state or SARA authorizations required to operate and offer postsecondary education programs, and to recruit in the states in which it engages in recruiting activities. We also have received approval from the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) and the Council on Occupational Education (COE) to permanently offer blended format programs that utilize both distance and on-ground education. Additionally, we have received permanent approvals from all state education authorizing agencies to offer blended format programs. We continue to work to ensure that we comply with applicable distance education rules and standards. We also will closely monitor any new rulemakings that concern state authorization or distance education.\nState Licensing Boards\nMany educational programs leading to professional licensure in a regulated profession require approval from, and are subject to, ongoing oversight by state agencies or boards. For example, certain Concorde healthcare programs, such as the Vocational Nursing, Practical Nursing, Dental Assistant, Massage Therapy, Nursing Practice (RN) programs, require and have obtained state licensure. Such programs are required to meet the standards of the state licensure agency or board and must periodically renew their licenses by completing a comprehensive license renewal process.\nInstitutional Accreditation\nInstitutional accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution voluntarily submits to ongoing qualitative reviews by an organization of peer institutions. Institutional accreditation by an ED-recognized accreditor is required for an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs. All of the UTI institutions and 14 of the Concorde institutions are accredited by the ACCSC. The remaining two Concorde institutions are accredited by the COE. Both ACCSC and COE are accrediting agencies recognized by ED. ACCSC and COE review the academic quality of each institutions instructional programs, as well as the administrative and financial operations of the institution to ensure that it has the resources necessary to perform its educational mission, implement continuous improvement processes, and support student success. Our institutions are subject to periodic review to confirm accreditation standards are met, and must submit annual reports, and at times, supplemental reports, to demonstrate ongoing compliance and improvement. ACCSC and COE require institutions to disclose certain institutional information to current and prospective students, as well as to the public, and require that our schools and programs meet various performance standards as a condition of continued accreditation. ACCSC and COE often revisit, revise, and expand their standards and policies. Institutions must periodically renew their accreditation by completing a comprehensive renewal of accreditation process.\nProgrammatic Accreditation\nIn addition to institutional accreditation, programmatic accreditation may be required for particular educational programs. Programmatic accreditors review specialized and professional programs in a range of fields and disciplines within an institution to ensure the public that an academic program has undergone a rigorous review process and found to meet high standards for educational quality. Certain Concorde healthcare programs, including the Physical Therapist Assistant, Dental Hygiene, Neurodiagnostic Technology, Polysomnographic Technology, Respiratory Therapy, Surgical Technology, Radiologic Technology, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Cardiovascular Sonography, Occupational Therapy Assistant, Pharmacy Technician, and Occupational Therapy Assistant programs, have obtained programmatic accreditation. Such programs are required to meet the standards of their programmatic accreditor and must periodically renew their accreditation by completing a comprehensive programmatic accreditation renewal process.\nTitle IV Programs\nThe federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through Title IV Programs in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible to participate by ED. All of our institutions are certified to participate in Title IV Programs. Significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include:\nThe 90/10 Rule. As a condition of participation in Title IV Programs, proprietary institutions must agree when they sign their PPA to comply with the 90/10 rule. Under the 90/10 rule, to remain eligible to participate in the federal student aid programs, a proprietary institution must derive at least 10% of their revenue from sources other than Federal education assistance funds. Federal education assistance funds are defined as federal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nAdministrative Capability. To continue its participation in Title IV Programs, an institution must demonstrate that it remains administratively capable of providing the education it promises and of properly managing its Title IV Programs. ED assesses the administrative capability of each institution that participates in Title IV Programs under a series of standards listed in the regulations, which cover a wide range of operational and administrative topics, including the designation of capable and qualified individuals, the quality and scope of written procedures, the adequacy of institutional communication and processes, the timely resolution of issues, the sufficiency of recordkeeping, and the frequency of findings of noncompliance. EDs administrative capability standards also include thresholds and expectations for federal student loan cohort default rates (discussed below), satisfactory academic progress, and loan counseling. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead ED to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, require the institution to repay Title IV Program funds, change the method of payment of Title IV Program funds, place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its continued participation in Title IV Programs, or take other actions against the institution.\nThree-Year Student Loan Default Rates. An institution whose cohort default rate exceeds 30% in consecutive fiscal years may be subject to conditions and restrictions and will lose eligibility if the rate remains above 30% three years in a row. An institution also will lose eligibility if its rate exceeds 40% for any fiscal year. None of our institutions had a three-year cohort default rate of 30% or greater for 2020, 2019 and 2018, for the three most recent FFYs with published rates. An institution whose three-year cohort default rate is 15% or greater for any one of the three preceding years is subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers. As of September 30, 2023, MIAT and Concorde campuses in Grand Prairie, Texas, Kansas City, Missouri, Memphis, Tennessee, and Miramar, Florida were subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers due to a three-year cohort default rate that was 15% or greater for one of the three most recent years.\nFinancial Responsibility. All institutions participating in Title IV Programs also must satisfy specific ED standards of financial responsibility. Among other things, an institution must meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds to students and any Title IV Program liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, comply with certain past performance requirements, and not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. Each year, ED also evaluates institutions financial responsibility by calculating a composite score, which measures an institutions overall financial health. The composite score utilizes information provided in the institutions annual audited financial statements and is based on three ratios: (1) the equity ratio which measures the institutions capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability; (2) the primary reserve ratio which measures the institutions ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and (3) the net income ratio which measures the institutions ability to operate at a profit. Between composite score calculations, ED also will reevaluate the financial responsibility of an institution following the occurrence of certain triggering events, which must be timely reported to the agency.\nBorrower Defense to Repayment. Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, students may file a claim with ED to discharge their federal Direct Loans (or Direct Consolidated Loans) if, generally, their institution misled them or engaged in other misconduct related to the making of their federal loans or the provision of their educational services. This is referred to as a borrower defense to repayment or BDR claim. On November 1, 2022, the Biden administration promulgated a revised version of the BDR rule, which took effect on July 1, 2023. On August 7, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a nationwide injunction, postponing the implementation of the borrower defense and closed school provisions of the new rule. The stay on the borrower defense and closed school provisions will remain in effect at least until the Fifth Circuit issues an order as to the pending motions that are on appeal. Until that time, the previous versions of the borrower defense and closed school provisions are in effect.\nSubstantial Misrepresentation. The regulatory definitions of misrepresentation and substantial misrepresentation enforced by ED are exceptionally broad and do not require intent by the institution to misrepresent, or actual reliance by the person to whom the alleged misrepresentation was made. Therefore, it is possible that a statement made by the institution or one of its service providers or representatives could be construed by ED to constitute a substantial misrepresentation, even if the statement was made in error, without intent to misrepresent, and the person to whom it was made did not actually rely upon it.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nIncentive Compensation. The incentive compensation prohibition forbids institutions from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. We believe our compensation practices for our admissions representatives comply with the current regulations and EDs guidance. We will continue to evaluate other compensation options under these regulations and guidance.\nTitle IV Program Rulemaking. ED is almost continuously engaged in one or more negotiated rulemakings, which is the process pursuant to which it revisits, revises, and expands the complex and voluminous Title IV Program regulations. We devote significant effort to understanding the effects of ED regulations and rulemakings on our business and to developing compliant solutions that also are congruent with our business, culture, and mission to serve our students and industry relationships. ED has recently undertaken, or proposed to undertake, rulemakings on the following topics:\n\u25e6Between October and December of 2021, the Affordability and Student Loans committee negotiated new rules relating to nine issue areas: (1) borrower defense to repayment, (2) closed school loan discharges, (3) total and permanent disability discharges, (4) false certification discharges, (5) income-driven loan repayment plans, (6) interest capitalization on Federal student loans, (7) pre-dispute arbitration and class action waiver clauses, (8) Pell Grants for prison education programs, and (9) Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Shortly thereafter, between January and March 2022, the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility committee considered new rules relating to seven issue areas: (1) the 90/10 rule, (2) ability to benefit, (3) certification procedures for participation in Title IV Programs, (4) change of ownership and control, (5) financial responsibility, (6) gainful employment, and (7) standards of administrative capability.\n\u25e6On October 28, 2022, ED published a final rule amending regulations governing Pell Grants for prison education programs, the 90/10 rule, and changes in ownership and control, effective July 1, 2023. On November 1, 2022, ED published a final rule governing borrower defense to repayment rule, closed school loan discharges, pre-dispute arbitration and class action waiver clauses, interest capitalization on Federal student loans, Public Student Loan Forgiveness, total and permanent disability discharges, and false certification discharges, also effective July 1, 2023.\n\u25e6On October 10, 2023, ED published a final rule related to financial value transparency and gainful employment, effective July 1, 2024. On October 31, 2023, ED published final rules relating to (1) financial responsibility, (2) administrative capability, (3) certification procedures; and (4) ability to benefit, effective July 1, 2024.\n\u25e6ED has announced plans to convene another round of negotiated rulemaking in the coming months. Potential topics for these rulemaking sessions include: (1) accreditation and related issues; (2) institutional eligibility, including State authorization; (3) third-party servicers and related issues; (4) distance learning; (5) return of Title IV funds; (6) cash management; (7) the use of deferments and forbearances; (8) the Federal TRIO programs; and (9) student loan debt relief.\nNon-Discrimination Rulemakings. On July 12, 2022, ED published a proposed rule to amend the regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). The regulated community is awaiting a final Title IX rule, which is expected in late 2023. ED also has indicated that it will be proposing a rule to amend regulations related to nondiscrimination on the basis of disability.\nOther Benefit or Aid Programs\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Labor, the Department of Education (through non-Title IV programs), and certain states provide support to postsecondary students through programs, grants, benefits, loans, or scholarships. All of our institutions that engage in such programs must comply with the eligibility and participation requirements applicable to each of these funding programs, which vary by funding agency and program.\nIn 2023, we derived approximately 10% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from veterans benefits programs, which include the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the Reserve Education Assistance Program (REAP) and VA Vocational Rehabilitation. To continue participation in veterans benefits programs, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA.\nUNIVERSAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nAdditionally, some states provide financial aid to our students in the form of grants, loans or scholarships. For example, the UTI campuses in Long Beach, Rancho Cucamonga and Sacramento, California, as well as the Concorde campuses in Garden Grove, North Hollywood, San Bernardino and San Diego, California, for example, are currently eligible to participate in the Cal Grant program. All of our institutions must comply with the eligibility and participation requirements applicable to each of these funding programs, which vary by funding agency and program.\nConsumer Protections Laws and Regulations\nAs a postsecondary educational institution, we are subject to a broad range of consumer protection and other laws, such as those that relate to recruiting, marketing, the protection of personal information, student financing and payment servicing. Such laws and regulations are enforced by federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and various state agencies and state attorneys general.\nWe received a January 18, 2022 letter from the CFPB explaining that it was assessing whether UTI is subject to the CFPBs supervisory authority based on its activities related to student lending. The CFPBs letter then requested certain information about extensions of credit to UTI students; generally explained the source and scope of the CFPBs regulatory authority; and advised that, after it reviewed the requested materials, the CFPB anticipates providing guidance regarding whether UTI is subject to CFPBs supervisory authority. We have provided the requested information and are awaiting further guidance, if any, from the CFPB.\nBoth UTI and Concorde, along with 68 other proprietary institutions, received an October 6, 2021 letter from the FTC providing notice that engaging in deceptive or unfair conduct in the education marketplace violates consumer protection laws and could lead to significant civil penalties. The notice stated that an institutions receipt of the letter does not reflect any assessment as to whether they have engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct, and the FTC did not request any information.\nWe devote significant effort to complying with state and federal consumer protection laws and regulations.\nNote 24 - Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund\nDuring fiscal 2020 and 2021, various pieces of legislation were issued related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act 2021 (CRRSAA) and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). In 2020, the CARES Act established the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) I, and in 2021 the CRRSAA established HEERF II and the ARPA established HEERF III, all of which included relief funds to be distributed directly to institutions of higher education. The original HEERF I grants required that 50% be used to provide students with emergency financial aid grants to help cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19 with the remaining 50% to be used to cover any costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to COVID-19 as institutional funds. HEERF II and HEERF III grants were only to be used to provide financial aid grants to students for proprietary institutions.\nAs of September 30, 2020, UTI had awarded all funds designated for students under the HEERF I program.
