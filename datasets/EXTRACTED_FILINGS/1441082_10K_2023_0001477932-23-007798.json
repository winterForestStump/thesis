The management approach designates the internal organization used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the basis for identifying our reportable segments. Using this approach, we have determined that we currently do business in three operating segments:\n\u00b7\nE-commerce sales of health and wellness products,\n\u00b7\nSales of memberships to our wellness app, and\n\u00b7\nSupport for our licensed wellness experiences.\nOur Corporate History and Structure\nWe were incorporated as Lake Forest Minerals Inc. in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2008. We were originally formed to engage in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties of merit; however; our former management was not successful in those endeavors and discontinued that business. With the acquisition of NOEO on March 10, 2022, and the onboarding of a new management team, we commenced operations in the health and wellness sector. We changed our name to The Healing Company Inc. in April 2021 and we changed our ticker symbol to HLCO on June 23, 2022.\nOur Acquisition Credit Facility\nTo facilitate our acquisitions program, in August 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend a credit facility to us consisting of up to $150,000,000 (under certain circumstances) in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments which we can use to acquire assets that meet certain criteria specified in the agreement. Individual term loans under this facility will be in a minimum principal amount of at least $400,000, bear an annual interest rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 12% and will mature in 12 months or less. We have established a wholly owned subsidiary, HLCO Borrower LLC, which will be the borrower under this term loan facility. When we acquire a business whose acquisition is to be funded, in part, through this credit facility, the term loan is made to HLCO Borrower LLC which, in turn disburses the borrowed funds at our instruction and the acquired assets are held in, and operated through, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of HLCO Borrower LLC. The term loans will be secured by a first priority lien on the assets of HLCO Borrower LLC, including all of the assets of the operating subsidiaries owned by HLCO Borrower LLC and funded through the term loan facility.\nOur Acquisitions under the Credit Facility\nOn October 14, 2022, we acquired all of the assets of Your Super, Inc., a super foods company founded by Michael Kuech and Kristel De Groot. Included in the Your Super, Inc. assets we acquired three Your Super operating subsidiaries - Your Superfoods B.V., Your Superfoods GmbH and Your Superfoods, Inc. The total consideration we paid for this acquisition consisted of (i) 3,200,000 shares of our restricted common stock valued at $2.50 per share for an aggregate value of $8 million and (ii) the forgiveness of $7,614,444.40 of outstanding debt of Your Super, Inc. owed to us. The outstanding debt was originally an obligation of Your Super, Inc. to a third-party lender. We acquired this loan obligation from the lender on September 9, 2022, for cash consideration of $2,000,000 and a seven-year warrant to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. In connection with our acquisition of the Your Super assets, we borrowed $3,000,000 under the term loan credit facility. Our Your Super business is now operated through Your Super HLCO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that we established to hold and operate the Your Super acquired assets. Your Super HLCO LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of HLCO Borrower LLC and all of the Your Super HLCO assets are now pledged to the term loan lenders under the credit facility agreement.\nOn March 3, 2023, we acquired certain assets of Chopra Global, LLC, a health and wellness company founded by Dr. Deepak Chopra, MD. These assets were components of Chopra Globals digital, licensing and consumer products divisions. The consideration paid and payable by us for the Chopra assets we purchased is an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000,000 in cash plus newly issued shares of our restricted common stock. $1,000,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price was paid to Chopra Global on March 3, 2023, along with the issuance of 1,400,000 shares of our restricted common stock. A deferred cash payment of $2,500,000 was paid to Chopra Global during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Additionally, we may pay to Chopra Global up to three (3) earnout payments of $1,000,000 in value each, subject to and payable in accordance with earnout thresholds specified in the purchase agreement with Chopra Global. Each of these earnout payments will be comprised of 50% in cash and 50% in shares of our restricted common stock. These earnout payments will be earned (i) for the period starting March 1, 2023 and ending December 31, 2023 if net revenue generated by the Chopra business operated by us exceeds $5,900,000; (ii) for the calendar year ending December 31, 2024 if such net revenue for that year exceeds $11,000,000; and (iii) for the calendar year ending December 31, 2025 if such net revenue for that year exceeds $15,000,000. The earnout shares will be valued at the market price at the time of issuance based on the five-day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the last day of the applicable measurement year. If we are taken private or undergo a change of control (as defined in our agreement with Chopra Global), any subsequent earnout payment(s) will be paid 100% in cash. In connection with our acquisition of the Chopra Global assets, we borrowed $1,582,000 under the term loan credit facility. Our Chopra business is now operated through Chopra HLCO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that we established to hold and operate the Chopra acquired assets. Chopra HLCO LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of HLCO Borrower LLC and all of the Chopra HLCO assets are now pledged to the term loan lenders under the credit facility agreement.\nThe following charts depict our organization structure.\nNOEO\nOn March 10, 2022, we acquired NOEO GmbH (NOEO) from our director and co-founder, Anabel Oelmann, for cash consideration of EUR 25,000. Ms. Oelmann founded NOEO to manufacture and market direct to consumers in Europe NOEO branded adaptogen herbal supplements. We have determined not to pursue the NOEO line of business and we are winding down our NOEO operations.\nFor Further Information\nFor a more detailed discussion of our development during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, including relating to our NOEO business, we direct you to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which we filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022, available at the following link:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001441082/000147793222007571/hlco_10k.htm\nOur Industry\nOur strategy, to first build a community of powerful healing brands, and second, connect them into a closed loop wellness system that prevents disease & unlocks thriving wellbeing, places us at the intersection of three vast & growing industries:\nWeve opted to place our primary focus initially on investments in the supplements & nutraceuticals market, which is characterized by high fragmentation and vague & changing regulation, but also strong unit economics and the opportunity to be the foundation of consumer habit building. The supplements & nutraceuticals industry is $165 billion globally, and projected to grow at a 9% CAGR through 2030.\nHistorically, the supplements & nutraceuticals market has been recession buoyant, with the industry growing 8% during the 2008-09 economic crisis, and recent study showing the last area consumers will cut spending is on health & wellness.\nEach of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, fragmentation, extensive intellectual property disputes and litigation, price competition, aggressive marketing practices, evolving industry standards, and changing customer preferences. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies operating in rapidly changing and competitive markets.\nEqually, the lack of an established, leading player operating at the intersection of these sectors creates immense opportunity to foster consumer trust & credibility, benefit from shared resource & data, and the higher impact, stickier experience generated from an ecosystem model.\nSupplements & Nutraceutical Industry\nThe supplements & nutraceutical industry focuses on nutritional supplements intended to improve longevity, sports fitness, and provide health benefits in addition to the basic nutritional value present in food. Most people are familiar with various supplement and nutraceutical products-and have likely used them-even if they are unfamiliar with the industry name. Supplements and nutraceuticals comprise such commonly used items as herbal products, specific diet products, vitamins, processed foods.\nThe Superfoods Market\nThe global superfoods market reached a value of $162.6 billion in 2022. As per the analysis by IMARC Group, the leading manufacturers in the superfoods market are focusing on product improvements to expand their product portfolio and increase their existing sales. They are consequently launching plant-based food variants to meet the nutritional requirements of the vegan population. Product manufacturers are also financing advertising campaigns, such as celebrity endorsements and social media campaigns. Moreover, cafes, restaurants, hotels, and quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are incorporating superfoods in their dishes to expand their consumer base. In addition, the advent of superfood powders that can be added to prepare smoothies, juices, and shakes is influencing the market positively. In addition, leading players are introducing ready-to-eat (RTE) superfood products on account of rapid urbanization, busy lifestyles, and expanding purchasing power of consumers. They are also extensively using superfoods in the production of dietary supplements, such as capsules and gummies, to meet the daily nutritional requirements of individuals. Looking forward, the market value is expected to reach $226.3 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period (2023-2028).2\nOur Manufacturing and Distribution\nManufacturing. We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers schedule and receive ingredient and packaging inventory according to parameters set in their contracts and forecasts we provide. Some ingredients and packaging are purchased by our contract manufacturers pursuant to framework contracts we have with the applicable suppliers. Our contract manufacturers are regularly audited by third parties and are required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. We believe our contract manufacturers have capacity to meet our anticipated supply needs, although short-term high demand can cause disruptions. We monitor both near-term and long-term capacity as well as fulfillment rates and overall performance of our manufacturing partners and qualify alternate suppliers as needed. In general, we purchase finished products from our contract manufacturers, which includes all packaging and ingredients used, as well as an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced. These finished products are then shipped directly to our distribution centers or shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer.\nSales and Marketing\nWe employ many different techniques and strategies within our marketing initiatives. These include direct-to-consumer outreach, use of influencers through social media, Facebook targeting, focused e-mail campaigns, and traditional media. Our marketing goal is always to increase visibility and relevance of our brands in the minds of our customers and potential customers. We hope to expand our programs to include experimental marketing techniques in the future.\nWith our Chopra and Your Super brands, we leverage a full-funnel, multi-channel strategy across owned, earned, and paid market resources, with a focus on strategies that fuel organic growth.\nYour Super Marketing\nOur Your Super owned channels include email, SMS, app, social (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook group, LinkedIn), blog, and our YourSuper.com website; our paid channels include Meta, Google, our Your Super store on Amazon, and influencers.\nOur marketing messaging typically centers around need (functional and/or emotional) + benefit, though central to our strategy is continual creative + message testing.\nAn example of our full-funnel marketing approach for our Your Super clinically-proven hormonal health and PMS product, Moon Balance starts with paid creative advertising on various social media platforms, which attracts potential consumers to our YourSuper.com website landing page where we provide additional Moon Balance product information leading to a call-to-action product purchase option.\nChopra Marketing\nOur Chopra product marketing typically leverages the very large owned audiences that Chopra has - a more that 4,000,000 emailable data base contact list, 20,000,000 social media followers on @chopra and @deepakchopra handles across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium and other social medium channels as well as the 7,000,000 engaged unique visitors to chopra.com annually. Chopra.com and the Chopra blog command significant domain authority with more than 300,000 important health and wellbeing related keywords and topics. We believe that his natural organic SEO and social reach is equivalent to tens of millions of dollars of marketing spend for this standalone brand.\n_________________\n2IMARC Impactful Insights\nCustomers\nYour Super - Customer Focus\nYour Super has a focused customer target: health motivated, though not health expert, suburban middle to upper class mothers who shop for Your Super primarily for the health benefits she will experience from the products. The demographic is middle age, middle-class females that live in suburban or rural communities.\nChopra - Customer Focus\nWhile the US and North America are the anchor markets for our Chopra brand, Chopra reaches far around the world including Europe, South America, Southern Africa, India and Australia.\nThe Chopra consumer is predominantly female and typically over the age of 40. The prime motivations for coming to Chopra are for seeking ways to manage stress and tension, emotional balance, general health and wellness and for deepening the experience with meditation and exploring further health and wellness related teachings. People often come to the Chopra brand after reading one of Deepaks books or seeing his teachings on social media or elsewhere. We categorize three core psychographics:\n\u00b7\nThe Spiritualists: motivated by their interests in to tapping into something deeper;\n\u00b7\nThe Improvers: driven by a sense to personally grow and become more effective; and\n\u00b7\nThe Recoverers: having experienced some kind of trauma, seeking help recovering from that trauma.\nTogether these three psychographics represent about 10% of the US population.\nSeasonality\nThe market for our Your Super and Chopra products displays some underlying seasonality, with the first half of the calendar year, January through June, typically outpacing the second half of the calendar year, July through December, and the most notable peak and trough months being January and December, respectively. Accordingly, we architect both campaigns designed to ride market tailwinds, such as community live detoxes and new product releases around new year and spring/early summer market peaks, as well as campaigns designed to stem troughs (e.g. limited edition re-releases of popular products around holiday, promotions, and/or challenges through summer months).\nCompetition\nWe are not aware of any other public companies that are acquiring health and wellness brands and building a community of businesses in this space. At the brand level, we consider the following factors in analyzing our competition:\nYour Super\nDue to the fragmented nature of the supplements, nutraceuticals, and superfoods spaces, as well as the functional design of our products, each formulated to address a single health need, we believe that our Your Super brand faces a broad range of competitors from manufacturers and marketers of superfood, protein, and collagen powder based products - from large agri-industry public companies with almost unlimited resources, such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, to small private start-up companies just entering our markets.\nChopra\nWe breakdown the competition to our Chopra brand along functional lines relating to our individual Chopra product offerings as follows:\n\u00b7\nChopra App. There are numerous app offerings in the health, wellness and mindfulness categories offering a variety of yoga, meditation and relaxation exercises and techniques with practices relating to, for example, stress and anxiety reduction, insomnia and addiction recovery. Additionally, over the past five years a number of apps promoting an Ayurvedic lifestyle have entered the market with information, exercises, detox programs and diet regimes.\n\u00b7\nChopra Signature Products. Currently, the health and wellness product market is highly fragmented and, for example, there are no significant Ayurvedic product competitors of scale in the West. However, our greatest competition comes from the fact that many brands and products in the health, wellness and nutrition space are starting to use more traditional Ayurvedic herbs such as aswhaganda, turmeric, boswella, brahmi and bitter melon in their formulations. In the beauty and cosmetics markets, a number of market participants are beginning to follow Ayurvedic principles and include Ayurvedic ingredients in their products.\n\u00b7\nChopra Wellness Experiences. The market for health and wellness retreats and related workshop and class offerings is very fragmented with thousands of yoga studios and an increasing number of breathwork, meditation and Ayurvedic massage studios and workshop offerings throughout the United States. Additionally, integrative health and functional medicine practices and related programmatic offerings have begun to emerge as a growing phenomenon across the country. Some of these offerings are led by well-known and respected industry experts such as Tony Robbins, David Asprey and Mark Hyman. At this time, however, given the size and growth in these markets, no brand has yet to dominate the health and wellness space.\nDue to Chopras vast product and service lines, it faces a variety of different competitors. For its meditation app, Chopras largest competitors are Calm, Headspace, and Betterup, all apps that focus on promoting mental health through different provided services. All three companies are high profile and thus are large competitors to Chopra. For Chopras products, its largest competitors are Ritual and Goop. Both companies provide products that incorporate Ayurvedic herbs in their products that rival the products that Chopra produces. For Chopras blog, its largest competitors include well+good and mindbodygreen, both companies that blog about health.\nCompetitive Strengths\nOur Overarching Strategic Advantage\nIn a highly competitive acquisitions market, we are building what we believe to be a focused and effective competitive advantage which makes us an attractive acquisition partner for smaller companies operating in the health and wellness space.\nWe are building a team bringing deep expertise in S-commerce (social media commerce), marketing, brand development, distribution, and international operations, with a track record of building & growing thriving consumer products companies, adding value in three key areas:\n\u00b7\nGrowth: Our in-house and partner experts in storytelling, growth and retention marketing, customer strategy, and conversion rate optimization will help catalyze efficient growth. Further we will help expand distribution through retail, internationally as well as through partnerships that we can uniquely bring to the table.\n\u00b7\nResources: We provide the capital, technology stack, distribution network, and operational support that allows the acquired business team to focus on product development.\n\u00b7\nCommunity: For our acquisition partners, being part of a community of integrated healing brands creates synergies and unlocks scale benefits & learnings for all member brands.\nBased on managements belief and experience in the industry, we believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively.\nYour Super\n\u00b7\nIngredients.

Each product contains only five to six superfoods with zero fillers, sweeteners, Stevia, artificial flavors, preservatives, or additives.

The health and wellness industry is highly fragmented with a large pool of companies representing significant opportunity for industry consolidation. We plan to continue our strategy of acquisition over the next 12 months. We expect to pay for any additional businesses that we might acquire through a combination of share capital and cash, some of which we expect to be provided through our credit facility in place for this purpose. We do not currently have sufficient capital internally to complete any additional acquisitions. We expect to raise capital for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing and equity offerings by us. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. There is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional businesses under the terms outlined above or that we will be able to find additional acquisition candidates in our target health and wellness sector.\nOur overarching strategic objectives are:\no\nInitially target the acquisition of scientifically backed companies in the $165 billion supplement and nutraceutical product segment.\no\nOperate our acquisitions as individual brands under the Healing Company umbrella.\no\nCreate portfolio synergies, cross sell, upsell, and, over time, add diagnostics, content and coaching.\no\nYield more health and healing impact, greater loan to value, lower customer acquisition costs and lower operating expenses.\n\u00b7\nIncrease Sales from Existing and New Customers. We expect to continue to drive growth for our consumer products branded businesses through our increased focus on our existing brands and the acquisition of new brands and our continued expansion in various health and wellness categories. We expect these efforts to result in incremental sales growth with existing customers plus new customer additions. We expect that our focus on delivering tangible benefits to consumers through product innovation will not only benefit us but also benefit our customers.\nWe intend to grow our existing brands through the following strategies:\nGrowing our Your Super Brand\nOur growth strategy for our Your Super brand is grounded in three tenets:\n\u00b7\nNew Product Development: Creating a steady pipeline of new products, formulated to meet our customers most important health needs, and that meet our standards of being easy, healthy, and delicious to use is critical to continue engaging our existing base and bringing in new customers. Consumer response to the launch of our nootropic coffee creamer alternative, Coco Clarity, in May of 2023, which was the first new product for Your Super in more than two years and which has become our number three SKU with a 4.8 star rating, is evidence of the existing demand for new Your Super products. Currently, in our Your Super product development pipeline we are working on a mix to promote hydration and we expect to be developing new products relating to, among other things, lactation and sleep.\n\u00b7\nMulti-Channel Distribution: Our primary goals in our distribution efforts continue to be focused on\no\nContinuing to cultivate our retail channels, including our Your Super store on Amazon, as strong complements to our D2C, direct to consumer, core;\no\nDriving profitable growth through both investment in targeted marketing to drive retail velocity and other third-party distribution channels; and\no\nMinimizing complexity and distraction to our core business while getting a jumpstart in the channel.\n\u00b7\nOrganic-Focused Growth Engine: Your Super utilizes powerful storytelling and positioning that creates, we believe, a rising tide across all of our marketing channels; we will continue to invest in SEO, CRO, and content marketing to both generate organic traffic and convert that traffic to sales; and we will continue to operationalize and optimize a rapid creative and funnel testing engine that will allows us to test, learn, and exploit the most efficient growth funnels across multiple marketing channels. Additionally, we intend to cultivate other organic and/or fixed-customer acquisition cost channels through the cultivation of brand partnerships and the launch of a brand ambassador program.\nGrowing our Chopra Brand\nOur Chopra brands growth strategy is based around four core pillars:\n\u00b7\nDaily Nourishing Rituals: Chopra will provide a combination of products and content to meet daily needs and to help build healthy living habits during the different times of the day - from wake-up, to nutrition, to stress management, to sleep.\n\u00b7\nSeasonal Cleanses: It often occurs where there is an alignment to the annual equinoxes and solstices and the Ayurvedic calendar to complete detoxification rituals that will help cleanse and reset from physical, mental, and emotional toxification. The Chopra detox kit, meditation, and breathwork programs will form core parts of these rituals.\n\u00b7\nIn Person Immersions: Through our current Chopra retreats or future experiences in development, we will expand opportunities for like-minded people to connect and experience a full 360-degree change through education, massage, breathwork, meditation, diet, and community support.\n\u00b7\nCommunity and Connection: Building our Chopra community of educators, teachers, and those seeking to learn and grow, the Chopra community has always been, and will continue to be, a thriving and essential part of the Chopra brand around the world.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe trademark protection is particularly important to the maintenance of the recognized brand names under which we market our products.\nWe protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including trademark, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Protection of our intellectual property often affords us the opportunity to enhance our position in the marketplace by precluding our competitors from using or otherwise exploiting our brands. We are also a party to several intellectual property license agreements relating to certain of our products. The duration of our trademark registrations is generally 10, 15 or 20 years, depending on the country in which the marks are registered, and we can renew the registrations. The scope and duration of our intellectual property protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product. Our global trademark portfolio, with the aforementioned registration durations, consists of our core marks for our business and our proprietary product brands which drive significant brand awareness for all of our businesses. Our proprietary product formulas and recipes, maintained as trade secrets, are significant to our growth and success as they form the foundation for our production and sales of effective, high quality products.\nEmployees\nWe currently have twenty employees including our Chief Executive Officer. We have also retained various independent consultants to serve in key operational roles, such as Chief Financial Officer, and other executives in marketing, strategy and implementation. Further, we have engaged advisors to assist our executive management with the ongoing execution of our business plan and expansion of our current product lines.\nRegulation\nThe supplement and nutrition sector of the health and wellness industry, in general, is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or the CPSC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA. Various agencies of the state and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business.\nThe areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:\n\u00b7\nproduct claims and advertising;\n\u00b7\nproduct labels;\n\u00b7\nproduct ingredients; and\n\u00b7\nhow our products are manufactured, packaged, distributed, imported, exported, sold and stored.\nIn addition, our products sold in foreign countries are also subject to regulation under various national, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs.\nParticular Regulations Applicable to our Your Super Brand\nOverview\nYour Super is subject to health claim regulations that differ in each of its major markets, including the US, EU, and UK, and which dictate if and how we are able to speak to the benefits of our Your Super products. Currently, we are generally able to speak to structure/functional benefits of our Your Super product formulations, in certain cases subject to meeting minimum nutrient thresholds.\nDetails\nThe regulatory environment for the supplements, nutraceuticals, superfoods, and plant-based nutrition industries varies across the US, UK, and Europe. While there are similarities, there are also notable differences in how regulations impact the sale and marketing of products in these industries.\nThe United States\nIn the US, the regulation of these industries primarily falls under the purview of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dietary supplements are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. Under DSHEA, supplements are considered a category of food and are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA. Whether a supplement or a food product, companies are responsible for ensuring the safety and labeling compliance of their products. The FDA can take action against products that are deemed unsafe or misbranded.\nRegarding marketing, companies are prohibited from making certain specific health claims about their products unless they have been approved by the FDA. However, they can make general structure/function claims that do not claim to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent specific disease, which is what Your Super does today. The FDA has the authority to take action against companies making false or misleading claims.\nThe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDA Act, permits structure/function claims to be included in labels and labeling which are truthful and not misleading. Permissible structure/function claims may describe how a particular nutrient or dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function. The label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease (i.e. a disease claim). If the FDA determines that a particular structure/function claim is an unacceptable disease claim that causes the product to be regulated as a drug, a conventional food claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim, or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading in any particular, we would be prevented from using the claim and would have to update our product labels and labeling accordingly. We take a number of actions to ensure that our labeling complies with this regulatory framework, including, undertaking third-party review of our labeling.\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the UK, the regulation of these industries is overseen by several authorities, including the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The FSA primarily regulates food safety and labeling, while the MHRA oversees medicines and medical devices.\nSupplements and nutraceuticals are generally classified as food products in the UK. Companies must comply with food safety regulations and ensure accurate labeling. Health claims made on products must be authorized by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) or be on the list of permitted claims. The MHRA regulates products that are considered medicinal, and these require specific authorization. Currently all of the Your Super products are classified as food products in the UK.\nEurope\nIn Europe, the regulation of these industries is governed by the European Union (EU) and its member states. The EU has established regulations for food safety, labeling, and health claims through various directives and regulations. The EFSA plays a crucial role in evaluating health claims and determining their scientific substantiation.\nCompanies must comply with EU regulations on food safety and labeling. Health claims must be authorized by the EFSA, and only those on the authorized list can be used. The EU also has specific regulations for novel foods, including superfoods and plant-based products, which require pre-market authorization.\nFederal Trade Commission and State Authorities\nThe FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all consumer products and requires that all advertising to consumers be truthful and non-misleading. The FTC actively monitors the advertising of dietary supplements, nutraceuticals and health-related products and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.\nAdditionally, U.S. State consumer protection authorities prohibit deceptive and unfair practices and may take action against companies deemed to defraud or deceive consumers.\nWe take a number of actions to ensure that our advertising and marketing is not false or misleading, including, undertaking third-party review of our labeling.\nNew Legislation or Regulation\nLegislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements and other health products. We cannot determine what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this report, before purchasing our securities. We have listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence) what we believe to be the most significant risk factors applicable to us, but they do not constitute all of the risks that may be applicable to us. Any of the following factors could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment. Some statements in this report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. [Please refer to the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.]\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe are an early-stage company with a limited operating history.\nWhile we were incorporated in Nevada in 2008, we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the early stages of development in highly competitive markets, particularly the markets for health and wellness products. You should consider the frequency with which early-stage businesses encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other adverse factors. These risks are described in more detail below.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred both operating and net losses in each of our last two fiscal years and current fiscal year and may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to build our brand and invest in our products and acquisitions. This lack of profitability limits the resources available to us to fund our operations and to invest in new products and services and otherwise improve our business operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to operate profitably or generate positive cash flows. If we cannot achieve profitability, we may be forced to cease operations and you may suffer a total loss of your investment.\nWe have limited revenues, are currently experiencing operating losses and we may not be able to manage our businesses on a profitable basis.\nWe had no revenues prior to our acquisition of Your Super in October 2022. Since then, and taking into account our acquisition of the Chopra Assets in March 2023, our revenues have been limited and we have generated losses. To support our operations, we have relied on proceeds from sale of stock and a credit facility dedicated to support the acquisition of new brands. For the year ended June 30, 2023, we generated an operating loss of $24,238,407 and a net loss of $21,308,823. For the year ended June 30, 2022, we generated an operating loss of $8,261,868 and a net loss of $8,264,200. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitably, that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due or that any revenues generated will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations. Management believes that our success will depend on our ability to successfully complete additional acquisitions of profitable health and wellness product companies. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in completing acquisitions of any other companies or that we will successfully integrate acquired companies. We cannot assure you that even if we are successful in completing the acquisitions, we will be successful in profitably managing such companies acquired assets and brands. We cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitability for any period of time or that investors will not lose their entire investment.\nIf we fail to implement our business plan and complete acquisitions as planned, our business will suffer accordingly.\nOur mission is the creation of a world-class health and wellness company engaged in the development, manufacture and sales of quality health, wellness and lifestyle products for distribution to an expanding global marketplace. We expect that our holding company strategy through which we plan to acquire profitable but undervalued target companies and products will enable us to accelerate the development and expansion of our brand and product portfolio and distribution channels. If we are unable execute our strategy of completing acquisitions as planned, we will not be able to fulfill our mission or grow our business as fast as we expected.\nWe are a holding company and thus dependent, in part, on acquired businesses to fund operations.\nOur business plan is based on our finding and acquiring high potential health and wellness product companies. We define high potential as companies that have significant growth, profit and health and wellness impact potential.\nIf we are unable to find appropriate companies that we define as high potential in an adequate time period it may mean that we will be unable to sustain operations. Further, in addition to third-party funding sources, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, it at all, we will be dependent on revenues generated by our acquired businesses which may not be sufficient to sustain operations and may make it more difficult to acquire additional targeted business opportunities. This may put us under operational pressure to reduce costs or raise more financing.\nOur acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and integration and consolidation risks, and we may be unable to profitably operate our consolidated company.\nWe are engaged in the business of acquisition, operation and management of health and wellness companies and brands. Our acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and present new risks associated with entering additional markets or offering new products and services and integrating the acquired companies or brands. We may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to integrate companies we acquire or to successfully operate new businesses and we may be unable to profitably operate our expanded company. Moreover, any new businesses that we may acquire, once integrated with our existing operations, may not produce expected or intended results.\nIf the large consumer goods businesses or investment funds make substantial investments in the market sector in which we operate, this could push up asset prices making acquisitions harder to complete and more expensive for us.\nOur growth is dependent on managements ability to identify and acquire suitable companies for acquisition.\nManagement will be working to identify business acquisitions and to negotiate purchase agreements favorable to the Company. These potential acquisitions, once identified, will require financial, legal and operational due diligence. If management fails to perform this due diligence adequately, there is a risk that the acquired businesses may unfavorably impact our operations.\nOur recently completed acquisitions are subject to uncertainties and risks.\nWe recently completed the acquisition of the Your Super superfoods business and a suite of operating assets from Chopra Group under the Chopra brand. There is no assurance that we will realize the benefits anticipated from our acquisition of these two businesses. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate these two new business lines into our management and organizational structure. The process of combining the operations of Your Super and the Chopra business lines that we acquired could prove difficult or unsuccessful and this could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nThe growth of our acquired businesses will be dependent on the management of those businesses as well as our ability to support their growth.\nOur business model is reliant, in part, on the founders or executives of the companies we acquire continuing to operate the business and working with us to grow their businesses. If these founders or executives choose to leave unexpectedly post-acquisition it will create operational pressures on us to operate in their absence, and could negatively impact the culture, operation and performance of the acquired company. This could have a material negative impact on sales and profitability.\nWe may not be able to manage future growth effectively.\nWe expect to continue to experience significant growth. Should we keep growing rapidly, our financial, management and operating resources may not expand sufficiently to adequately manage our growth. If we are unable to manage our growth, our costs may increase disproportionately, our future revenues may not grow or may decline, and we may face dissatisfied customers. Our failure to manage our growth may adversely impact our business and the value of your investment.\nOur success depends on the experience and skill of our board of directors, executive officers, and key personnel, whom we may not be able to retain, and we may not be able to hire enough additional personnel to meet our needs.\nWe are very dependent on Simon Belsham, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and Justin Figgins, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions. We are also very reliant on our board of directors, to set policy and provide strategic guidance, and to the rest of our management team and other partners who provide marketing, product development, technology, sales distribution and general management services to our acquired businesses to support their integration and growth. There can be no assurance that any of these persons will continue to be employed with or engaged by us for a particular period of time. The loss of any member of our board of directors or executive officer or any of our senior management team or advisors could harm our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nThe success of our strategy will depend on a well-defined management structure and the availability of a management team with proven competencies in the identification, acquisition and integration of complementary companies and assets. To implement our business plan, we will need to keep the personnel that we currently have and, if our business is to grow as planned, we will need additional personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining our present team or in attracting and retaining additional personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel or are unable to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur management is domiciled in the United State and Europe which may present some limited risk to operations.\nOur management team is spread out geographically across the US and Europe and so any further restrictions in travel due to a pandemic may present some limited risk to our ability to operate, build a team culture and effectively operate our business.\nAlthough dependent on certain key personnel, we do not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and management team to conduct our operations and execute our business plan, however, we have not purchased any insurance policies with respect to our executives and senior managers in the event of the death or disability of any of these persons. Therefore, if any of our executive officers or other members of our management team dies or becomes disabled, we will not receive any compensation to assist with any such created absence.\nOur ability to obtain continued financing is critical to the growth of our business. We will need additional financing to fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nOur future growth, including the potential for future market expansion will require additional capital. We will consider raising additional funds through various financing sources, including the procurement of commercial debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, and operating results may be adversely affected. Any additional debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility.\nOur ability to obtain financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in our industry, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, are not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to decrease the pace of, or eliminate, our future product offerings and market expansion opportunities and potentially curtail operations.\nEven if we obtain financing for our near-term operations, we expect that we will require additional capital thereafter, in part to support any future acquisitions. Our capital needs will depend on numerous factors including: (i) profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products by competitors; (iii) the level of investment in R&D; and (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nIf we lose our existing business acquisition credit line our plan of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe have entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend a credit facility to us consisting of up to $150 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement) in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments, the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria. To date, we have drawn down $4.87 million under the terms of this agreement in order to facilitate the purchase of our first two acquisitions. We expect to be able to access this credit facility for future acquisitions that we may determine to pursue but we cannot be sure that this credit facility will remain available to us under all circumstances. If we were to lose access to this source of acquisition related loans, our plans for future acquisitions could be jeopardized, we may not be able to raise required funding from other sources for the completion of planned acquisitions and our results of operations and general business prospects could suffer, our stock price could decline and your investment in our common stock could be lost.\nA default on the terms of a senior secured credit facility could result in acceleration of our loans or foreclosure on our assets.\nAs of September 20, 2023, we were out of compliance for the month ended August 31, 2023 with a financial covenant in our credit agreement requiring us to maintain at least $2,000,000 in unrestricted and unencumbered cash. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, our monthly EBITDA for Your Super was less than $75,000 which, under our credit agreement, resulted in a borrowing base deficiency with respect to the Your Super acquisition. These two defaults entitled our lenders, upon notice to us, to take action to enforce their rights against us including, but not limited to, demanding immediate payment of their outstanding loans to us in the principal amount of $4,873,163, as of September 30, 2023, and enforcing their liens on our Your Super and Chopra operating assets.\nOn October 12, 2023, we entered into a limited waiver to the credit agreement with our lenders, waiving the two breaches referenced above provided that (i) we regain compliance with our cash covenant referenced above no later than, and remain compliant after, November 30, 2023, and (ii) we deposit $150,000 into a special reserve collection account on behalf of the secured lenders prior to the earlier to occur of (x) November 30, 2023 and (y) the closing of a sale of our equity in an amount of not less than $2,000,000. Our failure to comply with either of these two new covenants will constitute an event of default under the credit agreement entitling our secured lenders to pursue all rights and remedies against us under the credit agreement, including acceleration of our loans, foreclosure and collection actions.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have a limited amount of cash available to us for operations and additional acquisitions. While management is confident about a near-term equity raise, we cannot guarantee at this time that we will be able to raise sufficient funds in the near term, on terms favorable to us, if at all, to comply with the terms of the limited waiver or to continue our business growth strategy. If we are unable to timely raise additional equity financing and our secured lenders exercise their right to accelerate our loan or foreclose on our assets, you may lose your investment in us.\nOur success is linked to the size and growth rate of the markets in which we are currently operating, health and wellness and super foods, and an adverse change in the size or growth rate of those markets could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAn adverse change in size or growth rate of the health and wellness and super foods markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Underlying market conditions are subject to change based on economic conditions, consumer preferences, the lingering impact of COVID-19 or other possible pandemics and other factors that are beyond our control, including media attention and scientific research, which may be positive or negative.\nGeneral economic conditions, including a prolonged macroeconomic downturn, may negatively affect consumer purchases, which could adversely affect our sales, as well as our ability to access credit on terms previously obtained.\nOur results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer spending, including general economic and business conditions, consumer confidence, wages and employment levels, the housing market, consumer debt levels, availability of consumer credit, credit and interest rates, fuel and energy costs, energy shortages, taxes, and general political conditions, both domestic and abroad. Consumer product purchases, including purchases of our products, may decline during recessionary periods. A prolonged downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economy may materially adversely affect our business, revenues and profits and the market price of our common stock, and we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from our existing financial institutions and the credit markets if needed, and if available, to the extent required and on acceptable terms. If we cannot obtain funding when needed, in each case on acceptable terms, we may be unable to adequately fund our operating expenses or our planned capital expenditures, which, taken together, may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive and fast-evolving industries, and our failure to compete effectively could affect our market share, financial condition and growth prospects adversely.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid changes, frequent new product introductions, established and emerging competition, price competition, aggressive marketing practices, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies operating in rapidly changing and competitive markets.\nThe health and wellness industry is a large and growing industry and is highly fragmented in terms of both geographical market coverage and product categories. The market for health and wellness products is highly competitive in all our channels of distribution. We compete with companies that may have broader product lines or larger sales volumes, or both, than we do, and our products compete with nationally advertised brand name products. These national brand companies have resources greater than ours. Numerous companies compete with us in the development, manufacture and marketing of health and wellness products worldwide. The market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. We also may face competition from low-cost entrants to the industry, including from international markets. Increased competition from companies that distribute through the wholesale channel, especially the private label market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as these competitors may have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities far greater than ours. We are also subject to competition in the attraction and retention of employees. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources and can offer employees compensation packages with which it is difficult for us to compete.\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products and services could harm our customer relationships and product sales significantly. The success of our new product offerings depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\naccurately anticipate customer needs;\n\u00b7\ninnovate and develop new products;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully commercialize new products in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nprice our products competitively;\n\u00b7\npartner with suppliers and manufacturers for our products and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and\n\u00b7\ndifferentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in some or all our markets, and our attempt to do so may require us to reduce our prices, which may result in lower margins. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our market share, business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and growth prospects.\nWe face significant competition in the health and wellness industry and we may face increased competition from smaller companies in our industry which could impact our business.\nThere is significant competitor risk in the health and wellness industry. Barriers to entry are low, there is minimal regulation that governs a large portion of the product offerings in this space and new entrants enter the market regularly. These factors may impact our ability to grow our business as they may negatively affect sales of our existing products or our ability to acquire or introduce new products as we compete with new companies better funded than we are that begin to enter our market.\nAlso, Increased competition from smaller companies in our market space could negatively impact our business. This competition could drive up customer acquisition costs, reduce customer loyalty, and push up supply prices. Further, should these competitors products experience health or safety issues, that could impact the reputation of the overall market segment and thus impact our operations.\nNew entrants may have better products than ours or more effective marketing for similar products. This could impact our sales of existing products and businesses we may have acquired.\nGrowth in a digital world is very reliant on a limited number of marketing platforms and their operational changes.\nGoogle and Meta Group still command more than 50% of all digital marketing spent in the US and Europe. These platforms are key to attracting consumers to our products. In addition, Apple is an important operator that facilitates these businesses and has recently made significant changes to its data privacy rules that have impacted many companies abilities to operate efficiently. Changes to the operation or algorithm of any of these companies could significantly impact our ability to grow any acquired businesses if we fail to anticipate and plan for changes that may occur.\nIn addition, variations in marketing costs through these platforms could impact our marketing expenditure and therefore ability to generate revenues.\nSignificant changes in costs or material disruptions to our service providers could negatively impact our ability to sell or achieve profitability.\nFrom our Direct-to-Consumer channels, we will largely work with Shopify and other partners for our e-commerce infrastructure. Any significant changes in costs or material disruptions in service would greatly impact our ability to sell our products or to achieve profitability.\nMarket adoption of online and app-based self-care and wellness solutions is relatively new and may not continue to grow, which may harm our business and results of operation.\nOur future success will depend in part on the growth, if any, in the demand for online and app based self-care and wellness solutions. While the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the market for online self-care and wellness solutions, the online and app-based health and wellness market is still less mature than the market for in-person wellness centers, which many businesses currently utilize, and these businesses may be slow or unwilling to migrate from these legacy approaches. As such, it is difficult to predict user demand for our web- and app-based platforms (including our Chopra app), user adoption and renewal, the rate at which existing users expand their engagement with our platform, the size and growth rate of the market for our platform, the entry of competitive offerings into the market, or the success of existing competitive offerings. Furthermore, even if users want to adopt an online self-care or wellness solution, it may take them a substantial amount of time and effort to fully transition to such virtual self-care solutions, or they could be prevented from accessing a platform due to budget constraints, weakening economic conditions, or other factors. Even if market demand for online self-care and wellness solutions generally increases, we cannot assure you that adoption of our platforms will also increase. If the market for online self-help and wellness solutions declines in growth or our platforms do not achieve widespread adoption, this could result in reduced customer spending, user attrition, and decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer trends, preferences, and demand for new health and wellness products and product enhancements could materially harm our customer relationships, and product sales or otherwise materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur health and wellness business is subject to rapidly changing consumer trends and preferences and product introductions, especially with respect to our superfood products and our Chopra signature product line. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes and introductions, and we may not respond or develop new products or product enhancements in a cost-effective, timely, or commercially appropriate manner, or at all. Current consumer trends and preferences have evolved and will continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer tastes; health, wellness, and nutrition considerations; competitive product and pricing pressures; changes in consumer preferences for certain sales channels; shifts in demographics; and concerns regarding the environmental and sustainability impact of the product manufacturing process.\nThe success of our response to changing consumer trends and preferences and product introductions, including any new product offerings and enhancements, depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\naccurately anticipate consumer needs;\n\u00b7\ninnovate and develop new products and product enhancements that meet these needs;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully commercialize new products and product enhancements;\n\u00b7\nprice our products competitively;\n\u00b7\nmanufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes, at our required levels of quality, and in a cost-effective and timely manner; and\n\u00b7\ndifferentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors and successfully respond to other competitive pressures, including technological advancements, evolving industry standards, and changing regulatory requirements.\nOur failure to accurately predict changes in consumer demand and technological advancements could negatively impact consumer opinion of our products or our business, which in turn could harm our relationships with our customers and cause a loss of sales. In addition, if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a cost-effective, timely, and commercially appropriate manner, or if our competitors release new products or product enhancements before we do, some of our product offerings could be rendered obsolete, which could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe success of our Your Super business is linked to the size and growth rate of the superfoods market and an adverse change in the size or growth rate of that market could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAn adverse change in size or growth rate of the superfoods market could have a material adverse effect on us. Underlying market conditions are subject to change based on economic conditions, consumer preferences and other factors that are beyond our control, including media attention and scientific research, which may be positive or negative.\nOur licensed Chopra Experiences partners may fail to maintain the quality of our brand and we may not be successful with our expansion plans.\nWe currently operate our Chopra Experiences business by licensing this product to carefully selected partners including the Chopra Health Retreat at the CIVANA wellness resort in Carefree, Arizona and the Chopra Mind-Body-Zone at the Lake Nona Performance Club in Lake Nona, Florida. We license our Chopra Experiences brand to these partners, and we prescribe and train them to implement our methods and contents to deliver our Chopra Experiences in its intended fashion. It is possible that the staff at these locations may not fully implement our methods in our prescribed manner or fail to maintain quality control of the Chopra Experiences. As a result, this could have a negative impact on our Chopra Experiences business and our results of operations.\nFurther, part of our future plans involves licensing our Chopra Experiences to additional partners. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in this endeavor. Failure to successfully build new Chopra Experiences licensing relationships could result in our business and financial condition being materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop our brands cost-effectively, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our Your Super and Chopra brands and any other brands that we might acquire in the future in a cost-effective manner will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable, secure and useful products and services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential users to be involved in our online self-care and wellness platforms, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control.\nBuilding awareness of our offerings is critical to our ability to recruit prospective users and generate revenue. A substantial portion of our expenses are attributable to marketing and sales efforts dedicated to attracting potential users to our offerings. Because we generate a portion of our revenue based on a subscription model, specifically with respect to the Chopra app, it is critical to our success of this product line that we identify prospective users who will take advantage of the platform for pre-recorded, and self-paced wellness opportunities, and that such users remain enrolled and active in these offerings.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, fluctuations in our user subscriptions based on a variety of factors.\nThe following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control, may prevent us from successfully driving and maintaining user enrollment in our online and app offerings in a cost-effective manner or at all, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve profitability:\n\u00b7\nNegative perceptions about online self-care and wellness programs. The online offerings that we or our competitors provide may not be successful or operate efficiently, and new entrants to the market also may not perform well. Such underperformance could create the perception that online offerings in general are not an effective way to achieve wellness or attend to self-care needs, whether or not our offerings achieve satisfactory performance.\n\u00b7\nUnsuccessful marketing efforts. We invest substantial resources in developing and implementing marketing strategies that focus on identifying the right potential product users at the right time. These marketing efforts make substantial use of search engine optimization, paid search, social media and custom website development and deployment and we rely on a small number of internet search engines and marketing partners. The effectiveness of our marketing efforts has varied over time and from offering to offering based on economic conditions, competition, offerings type, reputation, and other factors. We also face the risk that large advertisement and services platforms, like Facebook, Google, or app-stores etc., might disable our accounts at any time without-cause which could potentially hamper our ability to market our product online or at all.\n\u00b7\nLack of interest in an offering. We may encounter difficulties attracting users for our meditation and self-care practice offerings, providing programs that are not highly desired or that are relatively new within their fields.\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions. Users subscribed to our app offerings may be affected by changes in global economic conditions, including changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A worsening of economic and employment conditions may reduce the willingness of users to subscribe to self-care and wellness platforms due to increased economic uncertainty or any other factors, which could adversely affect our ability to retain subscribers on our platform.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe the health and wellness market is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of health and wellness products generally, as well as of products distributed specifically by us. Consumer perception of our products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, national media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption and use of health and wellness products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the health and wellness products market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on us, the demand for our products, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of health and wellness products in general, or our products specifically, or associating the use of health and wellness products with illness, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers' failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed.\nThere is significant growth in the health and wellness market at the moment, especially emerging from the COVID pandemic. However, if consumer sentiment changes and people turn away from a heathy lifestyle focus, this could cause the market to decline (or grow at a slower rate than forecast) and some businesses will fail.\nAn inability to obtain profitable operating margins could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe success of any of our acquired entities, including Your Super and our Chopra assets, will depend on the development of operating parameters to ensure our product expansion provides profitable margins by leveraging efficiencies of scale, operating cost discipline, negotiating suitable contract terms with contract manufacturers, advertising platforms and retail outlets and working to secure ingredients at acceptable costs. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential difficulties associated with growth, we may not be able to capture the efficiencies of scale that we expect from expansion and we may not be able to achieve our goals with respect to operating margins. As a result, our operating margins may not provide the expected profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nCOVID 19 or another pandemic could greatly impact our business.\nWhile we believe we are emerging from the impact and restrictions of COVID 19, there can be no assurance that we will not be impacted by a resurgence of this virus or another pandemic. Any such events could place substantive restrictions and impact on the industry. We could face closing of borders, restricting of supply chains, closing of shops and reductions in sales.\nThe efficacy of our ingredients may be limited.\nMany of the ingredients used in Your Super superfoods and in our Chopra product line havent undergone significant clinical or laboratory testing like pharmaceutical drugs do and therefore there are some risks that they may not have the efficacy or the impact that the general wisdom or science suggests they might. This is a risk for the entire market or for individual products.\nRelated to this there are often fads where some products are popular for short periods of time based on celebrity marketing which may increase their profile and popularity. Investing in fads carries significant risks that you may buy at peak valuations and then the valuation may decline over time as the fad becomes unpopular or a new fad captures consumer interest.\nOur inability to accurately forecast demand for our products could impact our profitability.\nOur business will be dependent on maintaining in-stock products for distribution. Should we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products resulting in over or under stocking of products we could impact on our revenues due to product wastage, missed sales due to our inability to deliver product timely, and the limitation placed on our available working capital due to overstocking of products.\nDisruption of supply, shortage, or increases in the cost of ingredients, packaging materials, and other raw materials as well as climate change could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe and our third-party contract manufacturers depend on third-party suppliers to supply us with the various ingredients, packaging materials, and other raw materials that are used in our products and their distribution. Our business could be materially harmed if we experience operational difficulties with our third-party suppliers, such as increases in costs (which we may not be able to, or want to, pass on to consumers), reductions in the availability of materials or production capacity, errors in complying with specifications or applicable law, insufficient quality control, and failures to meet production or shipment deadlines. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with our third-party suppliers or if such suppliers cease doing business with us or go out of business, we could face difficulties in finding or transitioning to alternative suppliers that meet our standards.\nMany of the ingredients, packaging materials, and other raw materials we use are subject to fluctuations in availability and price due to a number of factors beyond our control, including crop size, ingredient, water, and land scarcity, market demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier and logistics service capacities, import and export requirements, tariffs, and other government policies, and drought, excessive rain, temperature extremes, and other severe weather events. If we experience supply shortages, price increases, or supplier or regulatory impediments with respect to any of the materials we use in our products or packaging, we may need to seek alternative supplies or suppliers and may experience difficulties in finding replacements that are comparable in quality and price.\nFurther, the risks related to our ability to adequately source the materials required to meet our needs may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change and the legal, regulatory, or market measures that may be implemented to address climate change. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of storing and transporting our raw materials, or disrupt production schedules. The impacts of climate change may also cause unpredictable water availability or exacerbate water scarcity. In addition, the increasing concern over climate change and related sustainability matters may also result in more federal, state, local, and foreign legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, which may significantly increase our costs of operation and delivery.\nIf any of our third-party manufacturers fail to reliably supply products to us at the required levels of quality or fail to comply with applicable laws, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers to supply products to us. Any significant interruption of production at any of our third-party contract manufacturers, or other interruption in our supply chain, may materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. For example, natural disasters, including droughts, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, or floods, technical issues, work stoppages, or other unforeseen or catastrophic events, that result in significant interruption of production at any of our facilities or third-party contract manufacturers or suppliers could impede our ability to conduct business. If we were to experience such an event resulting in the temporary, partial, or complete shutdown of one of these manufacturing facilities, we could be required to transfer manufacturing to a surviving facility and/or third-party contract manufacturers if permissible. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our third-party contract manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the levels of quality, or the quantities, we require, and in compliance with applicable laws. Except for force majeure events, such as natural disasters and other acts of God, and non-performance by our contract manufacturers generally cannot unilaterally terminate these contracts. These contracts can generally be extended by us at the end of the relevant time period. Our contract manufacturers are also located in countries such as the United States and Germany. If any of our contract manufacturers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products in required volumes, at suitable quality levels, or in a cost-effective manner, we would be required to identify and obtain replacement manufacturing sources. There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain acceptable alternative manufacturing sources on a cost-effective or timely basis, or at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products would result in the loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nProduct contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our contract manufacturers to meet. However, despite our commitment to product safety and quality, our contract manufacturers may not always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our manufacturing processes and product offerings. Further, our manufacturing operations are subject to numerous regulations, including food and drug, environmental, and labor regulations, which continue to expand and evolve and require substantial expenditures. If our contract manufacturers fail to comply with our product safety and quality standards or applicable law, or if our products are or become contaminated, damaged, adulterated, mislabeled, or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain or events outside of our or their control, we may be required to undertake costly remediation efforts, which may include product recalls, the destruction of inventory, temporarily facility closings, and supply chain interruption, and may become subject to negative publicity, regulatory fines, and product liability claims, which could materially harm our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results. Further, any perceived degradation of product quality as a result of reliance on contract manufacturers may have an adverse effect on sales or result in increased product returns and buybacks.\nProduct contamination or tampering, or allegations of product contamination or tampering or product quality issues (whether or not valid) with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption or use are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nShould we fail to ensure that our information on our products is compliant we may face a loss of business, regulatory sanctions or investigations and litigation.\nProducts, websites and marketing materials will require compliant wording around ingredients and claims. Failure to be compliant or misleading images and words may result in litigation, reputation impact, lost sales or regulatory investigation.\nIf we experience product recalls, we may incur significant and unexpected costs, and our business reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are mislabeled or alleged to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur material product liability claims, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation, revenues and operating income.\nAs a distributor of products designed for human consumption, we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury. Our products consist of plant-based vitamins, minerals, herbs, spices, antioxidants, superfood mixes and other ingredients that are classified as foods and dietary supplements, and, in most cases, are not necessarily subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. Some of our products contain innovative ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur. As a marketer of products manufactured by third parties, we also may be liable for various product liability claims for products we do not manufacture. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that our products include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances. A product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInsurance coverage, even where available, may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising from our operations. For example, we may be liable for claims brought by users of our products or by employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations. We seek to minimize these risks through various insurance contracts from third-party insurance carriers. However, our insurance coverage is subject to large individual claim deductibles, individual claim and aggregate policy limits, and other terms and conditions. We retain an insurance risk for the deductible portion of each claim and for any gaps in insurance coverage. We do not view insurance, by itself, as a material mitigant to these business risks.\nWe cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient to cover our losses. Any losses that the insurance does not substantially cover could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNatural disasters (whether or not caused by climate change), unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and global political events could cause permanent or temporary facility closures, impair our ability to purchase, receive or replenish raw materials or cause customer traffic to decline, all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes (whether or not caused by climate change), unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks (including the recent outbreak of COVID-19), terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in locations where our facilities, contract manufacturers or suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. To the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our contract manufacturers or key suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through lost sales. In addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our customers, the temporary reduction in the availability of our products, expiration of inventory, future long-lived asset impairment charges and disruption to our information systems. These events also could have indirect consequences, such as increases in the cost of insurance, if they were to result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology and any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology. Our information technology systems are designed and selected to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain customer records, accurately track purchases, manage accounting, finance and manufacturing operations, generate reports, and provide customer service and technical support. Any interruption in these systems or any interruption associated with the transition of these systems to a new information technology platform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSystem interruptions or security breaches may affect sales.\nCustomer access to, and ability to use, our websites and our apps affects our sales. If we are unable to maintain and continually enhance the efficiency of our systems, we could experience system interruptions or delays that could affect our operating results negatively. In addition, we could be liable for breaches of security on our websites or our apps, loss or misuse of our customers personal information or payment data. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may negatively affect our operating results.\nWe must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. We have implemented, and we continue to implement, modifications and upgrades to such systems and acquired new systems with new functionality. These types of activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems into our current systems. These implementations, modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license the Chopra Groups content or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with the Chopra Group, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a license agreement with the Chopra Group to use the Chopra name, image, trademarks, and content, teaching and coaching curriculum. The existing license agreement imposes various covenants, restrictions and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under this agreement or we are subject to a litigation for breach of permitted uses, we may be required to make certain payments to the Chopra Group, we may lose the exclusivity of our license, or the Chopra Group may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license. If the Chopra Group were to terminate our license agreement for whatever reason, it would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and future prospects.\nUse of social media, emails, push notifications, and text messages in ways that do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, lead to the loss or infringement of intellectual property, or result in unintended disclosure may harm our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nWe use social media, emails, push notifications and text messages as part of our omni-channel approach to marketing. As laws and regulations evolve to govern the use of these channels, the failure by us, our employees, or third parties acting at our direction to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the use of these channels could adversely affect our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties. In addition, our employees or third parties acting at our direction may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that could lead to the loss or infringement of intellectual property, as well as the public disclosure of proprietary, confidential, or sensitive personal information of our business, employees, users, educators or others. Information concerning us or our partners and users, whether accurate or not, may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may have an adverse impact on our brand, reputation, or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. Many of the trademarks that we use contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We have not yet obtained registrations for some of our important marks. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for products similar to ours, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks.\nThere can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective, that any pending or future patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products, or that our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Additionally, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our product is or may in the future be offered may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our brand image may be harmed, and our business and results of operations may suffer.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, is time-consuming, diverts technical and management personnel and is costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing our product or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Any of these events could result in increases in operating expenses, limit our product offerings or result in a loss of business.\nWe may be required to indemnify our vendors and/or customers, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may provide certain rights of indemnification to our vendors and/or customers in certain circumstances. If any plaintiff is successful in certifying a class and thereafter prevailing on the merits of their complaint, such an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the nature and scope of the indemnity and defense we will likely need to provide, the legal fees associated with such indemnification could be significant enough to have a material adverse effect on our cash flows until such matters are fully and finally resolved.\nWe may be a party to lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nWe may be a party to lawsuits in the future (including product liability, false advertising, and intellectual property claims) that arise in the ordinary course of business. The possibility of such litigation, and its timing, is in large part outside our control. It is possible that future litigation could arise that could have material adverse effects on us.\nRisks Relating to the Regulatory Environment\nCompliance with new and existing laws and governmental regulations could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or the CPSC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA. These activities are also regulated by various state, local and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, manufacture, labeling and marketing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). Dietary supplements and dietary ingredients that do not comply with FDAs regulations and/or the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 will be deemed adulterated or misbranded. Manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded, and the FDA may take enforcement action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement on the market. The FDA has broad enforcement powers. If we violate applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA may bring enforcement actions against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk based on the required submission of serious adverse events or other information, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a health claim. Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular nutritional products or making certain claims or statements with respect to those products. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to an increased risk of litigation and liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.\nAdditional or more stringent laws and regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. In addition, regulators evolving interpretation of existing laws could have similar effects.\nOur products are affected by extensive regulations and our failure to comply with any regulations could lead to significant penalties or claims which could materially harm our financial condition and operating results.\nThe majority of our products are classified as foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. In both domestic and foreign markets, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, advertising, importation, exportation, licensing, sale, and storage of our products are subject to extensive government regulation. This regulation takes the form of laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and other similar constraints and exists at the federal, state, and local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we are, or will remain, in compliance with all of these regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could disrupt the manufacturing and supplying of our products, our marketing activity, our sale of our products, or lead to increased costs, legal or regulatory proceedings, the imposition of significant penalties, or harm our reputation, any of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory policies and initiatives, and may promulgate new or revised, or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing, regulations at any time. The adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations, such as those relating to genetically modified foods, may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of impacted product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products or require us to change or cease aspects of our business, any of which could result in significant loss of sales and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor example, we are subject to the rules of the FDA, including Current Good Manufacturing Practice or CGMP regulations. Any failure by us or our contract manufacturers or third-party suppliers and vendors to comply with the CGMPs could negatively impact our reputation and ability to sell our products even after the situation has been rectified and, in the case of our contract manufacturers, even though we are not directly liable under the CGMPs for their compliance. In complying with the dietary supplement CGMPs, we may experience increases in production costs due to increases in required testing of raw ingredients, work in process, and finished products. In addition, regulators and other governmental authorities limit the types of claims that we can make about our products, including nutrition content claims, health claims, and therapeutic claims and otherwise regulate the marketing of our products. For example, the FTCs guides explain how the FTC interprets prohibitions on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Consequently, the FTC could bring an enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with their guides. It is possible that our use of marketing materials, including testimonials about our products, may be significantly impacted by laws, rules, and regulations governing the marketing of our products and therefore might negatively impact our sales.\nA portion of our business is conducted in foreign jurisdictions, exposing us to the risks associated with international operations.\nApproximately 36% of our net sales for the year ended June 30, 2023 were generated outside the United States, exposing our business to risks associated with international operations. We plan to invest significant resources in our international operations and expect to continue to do so as we acquire new businesses and enter new markets. However, there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the direct-selling industry, which is regulated in many jurisdictions.\nFor example, a foreign government may impose trade restrictions or increased tariffs, require compliance with trade and economic sanctions laws, rules, or regulations, such as those administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control, implement new or change existing trade policies, or otherwise limit or restrict our ability to import products in a cost-effective manner, or at all, any of which could negatively impact our operations.\nOur operations in some jurisdictions also may be adversely affected by political, economic, legal, regulatory, and social conditions, or instability, as well as by economic and political tensions between governments. In addition, our compliance with our code of conduct and anti-bribery laws, rules, and regulations may conflict with local customs and practices in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur ability to staff and manage our international operations could also be affected by laws and regulations related to immigration. For example, current and future tightening of U.S. immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non-U.S. employees in the U.S. or our ability to hire new non-U.S. employees in the U.S. and may adversely affect the ability of non-U.S. employees from entering the United States.\nWe are also exposed to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, foreign exchange controls, limitations on the repatriation of funds, and changes in currency policies or practices. Accordingly, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus a foreign currency could have a negative impact on us. Although we may engage in transactions to protect against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot be certain any hedging activity will effectively reduce our exchange rate exposure. In addition, due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of a country and control of exchange rates, we may not be able to immediately repatriate cash at the official exchange rate. If this should occur, or if the official exchange rate devalues, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, operating results, or cash flows.\nOur overall success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks, and to coordinate the various legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving and subject to change, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so without incurring unexpected or increased costs or at all. In certain regions, the degree of these risks may be higher due to more volatile economic, political, or social conditions; less developed and predictable legal and regulatory regimes; and increased potential for various types of adverse governmental action. As we continue to focus on expanding our existing international operations, these and other risks associated with international operations will likely increase, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to the anti-bribery laws, rules, and regulations of the United States and the other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe are subject to a variety of anti-bribery laws, rules, and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws, rules, and regulations in the other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. These regimes generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business as well as require companies to maintain accurate books and records. There has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and criminal and civil enforcement proceedings brought against companies and individuals by regulators, including the Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the SEC. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, rules, and regulations, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws, rules, and regulations may conflict with local customs and practices. Additionally, we cannot predict the nature, scope, or effect of future anti-bribery requirements or the manner in which existing or new requirements might be administered or interpreted. Alleged or actual violations of any such existing or future laws, rules, or regulations, whether due to our own acts or inadvertence or to the acts or inadvertence of others, may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including fines, penalties, contract cancellations, or debarment, increased compliance costs, changes to our activities, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur failure to comply with FTC regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties and could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and all food products and requires that all advertising to consumers be truthful and non-misleading. The FTC actively monitors the dietary supplement space and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that may increase our cost of operations or expose us to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges from our operations into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water and groundwater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for remedial actions, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. New laws, changes in existing laws or the interpretation thereof, or the development of new facts or changes in their processes could also cause us to incur additional capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations and environmental permits. Any failure by us to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of our operations, including operations at our manufacturing facility. We also could incur monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims or cleanup or other costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such requirements.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment without regard to fault or knowledge about the condition or action causing the liability. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or for properties to which substances or wastes that were sent in connection with current or former operations at our facilities. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could also adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties, or to use them as collateral for financing.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international privacy, data protection, marketing and consumer protection laws, regulations and industry standards, or the expansion of current or the enactment or adoption of new privacy, data protection, marketing and consumer protection laws, regulations or industry standards, could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations and industry standards regarding privacy, data protection, data security, marketing and consumer protection, which address the collection, storing, sharing, using, processing, disclosure and protection of data relating to individuals, as well as the tracking of consumer behavior and other consumer data. We are also subject to laws, regulations and industry standards relating to endorsements and influencer marketing. Many of these laws, regulations and industry standards are changing and may be subject to differing interpretations, are costly to comply with or inconsistent among jurisdictions. For example, the FTC expects companies like ours to comply with guidelines issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and storage of consumer information, and establish principles relating to notice, consent, access and data integrity and security. The laws and regulations in many foreign countries relating to privacy, data protection, data security, marketing and consumer protection often are more restrictive than in the United States, and may in some cases be interpreted to have a greater scope. Additionally, the laws, regulations and industry standards, both foreign and domestic, relating to privacy, data protection, data security, marketing and consumer protection are dynamic and may be expanded or replaced by new laws, regulations or industry standards.\nWe strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, contractual and other legal obligations and certain applicable industry standards of conduct relating to privacy, data security, data protection, marketing and consumer protection. However, these obligations and standards of conduct often are complex, vague, and difficult to comply with fully, and it is possible that these obligations and standards of conduct may be interpreted and applied in new ways and/or in a manner that is inconsistent with each other or that new laws, regulations or other obligations may be enacted. It is possible that our practices may be argued or held to conflict with applicable laws, policies, contractual or other legal obligations, or applicable industry standards of conduct relating to privacy, data security, data protection, marketing or consumer protection. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, FTC, other regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or, as we continue to expand internationally, international privacy, data security, data protection, marketing or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, contractual obligations or self-regulatory principles or other industry standards could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities or could result in a loss of consumers. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For instance, with the increased focus on the use of data for advertising, the anticipation and expectation of future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impact us. In addition, as we expand our data analytics and other data related product offerings there may be increased scrutiny on our use of data and we may be subject to new and unexpected regulations. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could, for example, impair our ability to collect or use information that we utilize to provide targeted digital promotions and media to consumers, thereby impairing our ability to maintain and grow our total customers and increase revenues. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our users data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to modify our solutions, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop or outright prohibit new solutions and features. Any such new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretation of existing laws, regulations or other standards may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. If our measures fail to comply with current or future laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations or industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, data security, marketing or consumer protection, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, fines or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Moreover, if future laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretations of the foregoing limit our ability to store, process and share personally identifiable information or other data, demand for our products could decrease, our costs could increase, our revenue growth could slow, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe are exposed to potential liability for information on our customers websites and for products and services sold through their websites and we may incur significant costs and damage to our reputation as a result of defending against such potential liability.\nWe are exposed to potential liability for information on our customers websites. We could be exposed to liability with respect to such third-party information such as their products, links to third-party websites, advertisements and content provided by customers. Among other things, we may face assertions that, by directly or indirectly providing such third-party content or links to other websites, we should be liable for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other actions by parties providing such content or operating those websites. We may also face assertions that content on our publishers and advertisers websites, including statistics or other data we compile internally, or information contained in websites linked to our websites contains false information, errors or omissions, and users and our customers could seek damages for losses incurred as a result of their reliance upon or otherwise relating to incorrect information. We may also be subject to fines and other sanctions by the government for such incorrect information. In addition, our services could be used as a platform for fraudulent transactions and third-party products and services sold through us may be defective. The measures we take to guard against liability for third-party content, information, products and services may not be adequate to exonerate us from relevant civil and other liabilities.\nAny such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend and result in litigation and significant diversion of managements attention and resources. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims and suffer damage to our reputation.\nIf the use of third-party cookies or other tracking technology is rejected by Internet users, restricted by third parties outside of our control, or otherwise subject to unfavorable regulation, our performance could decline and we could lose customers and revenue.\nWe use a number of technologies to collect information about our customers. For instance, we use small text files (referred to as cookies), placed through an Internet browser on an Internet users machine which corresponds to a data set that we keep on our servers, to gather important data. Our cookies collect anonymous information, such as when an Internet user views an advertisement, clicks on an advertisement, or visits one of our advertisers websites. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. On mobile devices, we may also obtain location-based information about the users device through our cookies or other tracking technologies. We use these technologies to achieve our campaign goals, to ensure that the same Internet user does not unintentionally see the same media too frequently, to report aggregate information regarding the performance of our digital promotions and marketing campaigns, and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity throughout our network.\nCookies may easily be deleted or blocked by Internet users. All of the most commonly used Internet browsers (including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari) allow Internet users to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Internet users can also delete cookies from their computers at any time. Some Internet users also download ad blocking software that prevents cookies from being stored on a users computer. If more Internet users adopt these settings or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently do, our business could be harmed. In addition, the Safari and Firefox browsers blocks third-party cookies by default, and other browsers may do so in the future. Unless such default settings in browsers were altered by Internet users to permit the placement of third-party cookies, we would be able to set fewer of our cookies in users browsers, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, companies such as Google have publicly disclosed their intention to move away from cookies to another form of persistent unique identifier, or ID, to identify individual Internet users or Internet-connected devices in the bidding process on advertising exchanges. If companies do not use shared IDs across the entire ecosystem, this could have a negative impact on our ability to find the same anonymous user across different web properties, and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nIn addition, in the European Union, or EU, Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the Cookie Directive, directs EU member states to ensure that collecting information on an Internet users computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has appropriately given his or her prior freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent. Similarly, this Directive which also contains specific rules for the sending of marketing communications, limits the use of marketing texts messages and e-mails. Additionally, an e-Privacy Regulation, which will replace the Cookie Directive with requirements that could be stricter in certain respects, apply directly to activities within the EU without the need to be transposed in each member states law, and could impose stricter requirements regarding the use of cookies and marketing e-mails and text messages and additional penalties for noncompliance, has been proposed, although at this time it is unclear whether it will be approved as it is currently drafted or when its requirements will be effective. We may experience challenges in obtaining appropriate consent to our use of cookies from consumers or to send marketing communications to consumers within the EU, which may affect our ability to run promotions and our operating results and business in European markets, and we may not be able to develop or implement additional tools that compensate for the lack of data associated with cookies. Moreover, even if we are able to do so, such additional tools may be subject to further regulation, time consuming to develop or costly to obtain, and less effective than our current use of cookies.\nWe may face economic, political and other risks associated with international operations should we determine to expand into the international marketplace, which may adversely affect our revenues and international growth prospects.\nInternational operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent to operating in foreign countries, and any expansion of our international operations will amplify the effects of these risks, which include, among others:\n\u00b7\ndifferences in culture, economic and labor conditions and practices;\n\u00b7\nthe policies of the U.S. and foreign governments;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in trade relations and economic instability;\n\u00b7\ndifferences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nsocial and political unrest;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other catastrophic events;\n\u00b7\ncomplex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights; and\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods.\nWe may also be affected by domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business abroad or importing and exporting goods and materials. These include tax laws, laws regulating competition, anti-bribery/anti-corruption and other business practices, and trade regulations, including duties and tariffs. Compliance with these laws is costly, and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations. Additionally, while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure, significant changes in how U.S. and foreign jurisdictions tax cross-border transactions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur results of operations and financial position may also be impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. Unfavorable currency exchange rates between the US Dollar and foreign currencies, could adversely affect us in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period.\nThere are other risks that may be inherent to international operations, including the potential for changes in socio-economic conditions, laws and regulations, including, among others, competition, import, export, labor and environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and monetary and fiscal policies, protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, or impact trade volumes, unsettled political conditions; government-imposed plant or other operational shutdowns, backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions, corruption; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses, violence, civil and labor unrest, and possible terrorist attacks.\nAdditionally, if the opportunity arises, we may expand our operations into new and high-growth international markets. However, there is no assurance that we will expand our operations in such markets in our desired time frame. To expand our operations into new international markets, we may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. We may enter into these transactions to acquire other businesses or products to expand our products or take advantage of new developments and potential changes in the industry. Our lack of experience operating in new international markets and our lack of familiarity with local economic, political and regulatory systems could prevent us from achieving the results that we expect on our anticipated time frame or at all. If we are unsuccessful in expanding into new or high-growth international markets, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFuture planned international operations may require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions in which we do business.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis will require us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires us to maintain adequate record- keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the international locations in which we may operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We expect to establish policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations should this be required. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivacy protection is increasingly demanding, and we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with security breaches, data loss, credit card fraud and identity theft that could cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenue, suffer reputational harm with our customers, as well as other risks.\nThe protection of customer, employee, vendor and other business data is critical to us. We receive confidential customer data, including payment card and personally identifiable information, in the normal course of customer transactions. In order for our sales channels to function, we and other parties involved in processing customer transactions must be able to transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely over public networks. While we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information, the intentional or negligent actions of employees, business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures and result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to our data systems and misappropriating confidential data. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent a compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and personal data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable, degrade, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any compromise of our data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage, interruption of our operations, increased operating costs associated with remediation, equipment acquisitions or disposal, added personnel, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business or investor confidence. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and material liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nFederal, state, provincial and international laws and regulations govern the collection, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our employees, customers and vendors. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy has been increasingly demanding in recent years, including the recent implementation of the California Consumer Privacy Act. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these and other international data privacy and security laws may limit our business and services and could have a materially adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe that we are in material compliance with all laws, regulations and self-regulatory regimes that are applicable to us. However, the laws, regulations, and self-regulatory regimes may be modified, and new laws may be enacted in the future that may apply to us and affect our business. Further, data protection authorities may interpret existing laws in new ways. We may deploy new services from time to time, which may also require us to change our compliance practices. Any such developments (or developments stemming from enactment or modification of other laws) or the failure to anticipate accurately the application or interpretation of these laws could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, increase our future compliance costs, make our products and services less attractive to our customers, or cause us to change or limit our business practices, and materially affect our business and operating results. Further, any failure or perceived failure by us or third-party service providers to comply with international data privacy and security laws may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, fines, private lawsuits or reputational damage.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe have discretion in the use of proceeds from our securities issuances.\nGenerally, when we issue securities, our management will have broad discretion with respect to the application of net proceeds received by us from the sale of the securities and may spend such proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of the securities issued and outstanding from time to time. Any failure by management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business or cause the price of our securities issued and outstanding from time to time to decline.\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets QB tier under the trading symbol HLCO. There can be no assurance that an active and liquid market for our common stock will develop or be maintained, and an investor may find it difficult to resell any of our securities.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. This volatility may affect the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their securities at an advantageous price. Such volatility could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to numerous factors including:\n\u00b7\nthe publics reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with regulatory authorities and those of its competitors;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in broader stock market prices and volumes or adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or as a result of pandemics and/or social unrest generally;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of the Company, its prospects or the industry in general;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\ncommencement of or involvement in litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory landscape applicable to us;\n\u00b7\nmedia reports, publications or public statements relating to, or public perceptions of, the regulatory landscape applicable to us, whether correct or not;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of strategic alliances, significant contracts, new technologies, acquisitions, dispositions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations or cash flows or those of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7\nrevenues and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in a particular quarter;\n\u00b7\ndownward revision in securities analysts estimates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of its competitors;\n\u00b7\nfuture issuances and sales of our common stock or other of our securities, including the sale of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding Seed Preferred Shares;\n\u00b7\nsales of common stock by insiders of the Company;\n\u00b7\nthird party disclosure of significant short positions;\n\u00b7\ndemand for and trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nshort-term fluctuation in share price caused by changes in general conditions in the domestic and worldwide economies or financial markets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in global financial markets and global economics and general market conditions, such as interest rates and product price volatility.\nThe realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of the common stock to decline significantly.\nIn addition, broad market, societal and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, our operations could be adversely impacted, and the trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nIn the past, following a significant decline in the market price of a companys securities, there have been instances of securities class action litigation having been instituted against that company. If we were to be involved in any similar litigation, we could incur substantial costs, managements attention and resources could be diverted and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of investors to achieve a return on their investment will depend entirely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of its business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the directors and will depend on, among other things, the Companys earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that the directors deem relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Any credit agreements which we may enter into with institutional lenders, may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and any other factors that the board of directors decides is relevant. Therefore, any return on your investment in our capital stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of the capital stock.\nWe are a holding company and our earnings depend on the earnings and distributions of our subsidiaries.\nWe have limited assets and we will conduct substantially all of our business through our current operating subsidiaries which will generate all or substantially all our revenues. Our current ability and that of our acquired businesses to distribute funds to us will depend on operating results and tax considerations (both domestic and foreign), applicable laws and regulations which require that solvency and capital standards be maintained by these subsidiaries and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt, existing or to be incurred. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, or any other future subsidiary, holders of indebtedness and trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us.\nFuture sales of common stock by shareholders, directors or officers could create volatility in our share price.\nSubject to compliance with applicable securities laws and the terms of any applicable lock-up arrangements, our officers, directors, promoters and their affiliates may sell some or all of their common stock in the future. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, such future sales of common stock will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. However, the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by our officers and directors, promoters and their affiliates, or the perception that such sales could occur, could materially adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nCertain outstanding shares of our common stock are, subject to applicable securities laws, generally immediately available for resale in the public markets. Additional shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options may also become available for sale in the public market, which may also cause the market price of the common stock to fall. Accordingly, if substantial amounts of common stock are sold in the public market, the market price of our common stock, which is thinly traded could fall substantially.\nA small number of shareholders may exercise significant influence on matters submitted to Shareholders for approval.\nWe have a small number of shareholders who own, in the aggregate, approximately a 55% equity interest in us. As a result, although these shareholders may not have an agreement to act in concert, they have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to the vote of shareholders for approval, whether subject to approval by a majority of the shareholders or special resolution.\nWe may issue additional shares and additional issuances could dilute a shareholders holdings.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock in the future which may dilute a shareholders holdings in us. Our preferred stock, and shareholders have no pre-emptive rights in connection with any future issuances. Our directors have the discretion to determine the provisions attaching to the common stock and the price and the terms of issue of further common stock and preferred stock.\nAdditional equity financing, including pursuant to an at-the-market offering, may be dilutive to shareholders and could contain rights and preferences superior to those of the common stock. Debt financing may involve restrictions on our financing and operating activities. Debt financing may be convertible into other of our securities which may result in immediate or resulting dilution. In either case, additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds as needed, the scope of our operations or growth may be reduced and, as a result, we may be unable to accomplish our long-term goals and objectives. In this case, investors may lose all or part of their investment. Any default under debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on us, our business, or the results of operations.\nPurchasers of our common stock may experience immediate and substantial dilution of their investment.\nThe offering price of our common stock may significantly exceed the net tangible book value per share of the common stock. Accordingly, a purchaser of our common stock may incur immediate and substantial dilution of their investment. If outstanding options and warrants to purchase common stock are exercised or securities convertible into common stock are converted, additional dilution will occur. We may sell additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common stock in future offerings or we may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities to finance future acquisitions.\nWe cannot predict the size or nature of future sales or issuances of securities or the effect, if any, that such future sales and issuances will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or issuances of substantial numbers of shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common stock, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of the common stock. With any additional sale or issuance of common stock or other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common stock, investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest in us. Furthermore, to the extent holders of our stock options or other convertible securities convert or exercise their securities and sell the common stock they receive, the trading price of the common stock may decrease due to the additional number of shares of our common stock available in the market.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new common stock or the trading of outstanding common stock, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and would result in the dilution of your holdings.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, or the expiration of lock-up agreements, if any, that might restrict the issuance of new common stock or the trading of outstanding common stock, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our securities, or the future expirations of lock-up agreements, on the price of our common stock. In all events, future issuances of our common stock would result in the dilution of your holdings. In addition, the perception that new issuances of our securities could occur, or the perception that locked-up parties will sell their securities when the lock-ups expire, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future issuances of preferred stock, which could rank senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividends and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the level of return you may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities, and lenders with respect to other borrowings we may make, would receive distributions of our available assets prior to any distributions being made to holders of our common stock. Moreover, if we issue preferred stock, the holders of such preferred stock could be entitled to preferences over holders of common stock in respect of the payment of dividends and the payment of liquidating distributions. Because our decision to issue debt or preferred stock in any future offering, or borrow money from lenders, will depend in part on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any such future offerings or borrowings. Holders of our common stock must bear the risk that any future offerings we conduct or borrowings we make may adversely affect the level of return, if any, they may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur Company does not own any real estate or other properties. Our business office is located at 130 W 50th Street, 2nd Floor, New York, New York, 10020. The Company has not entered into any agreements for office space. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company knows of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against it, nor is the Company involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which its directors, officers or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to its interest. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the OTCQB tier of OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol HLCO.\nOur common stock is subject to rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Those disclosure rules applicable to penny stocks require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized list disclosure document prepared by the SEC. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in penny stocks can be very risky and that the investor's salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure contains further warnings for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in penny stocks, to independently investigate the security, as well as the salesperson with whom the investor is working and to understand the risky nature of an investment in this security. The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. Further, the rules require that, following the proposed transaction, the broker provide the customer with monthly account statements containing market information about the prices of the securities.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. Many brokers may be unwilling to engage in transactions in our common stock because of the added disclosure requirements, thereby making it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of their shares.\nOn October 19, 2023, the last reported sales price of our common stock as reported by OTC Markets was $1.72.\nOur Common Stock\nOur shares of common stock are issued in registered form. Pacific Stock Transfer Inc., Suite 300, 6725 Via Austi Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89119, (800) 785-7782, is the registrar and transfer agent for the Company's common stock.\nAs of October 19, 2023, there were 57,474,920 shares of our common stock outstanding held by approximately 200 holders of record of our common stock. This number was derived from our stockholder records and does not include beneficial owners of our common stock whose shares are held in the name of various dealers, clearing agencies, banks, brokers and other fiduciaries.\nOur Seed Preferred Stock\nPacific Stock Transfer Inc. is also the registrar and transfer agent for our seed preferred shares.\nAs of October 19, 2023, we had 11 shareholders of record for our seed preferred stock and a total of 645,000 shares of seed preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nOur Seed Preferred Stock does not currently trade on any markets.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. We may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nOn June 10, 2022, our board of directors adopted the 2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2022 Omnibus Plan. Adoption of the 2022 Omnibus Plan was also approved on June 10, 2022, by the stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Company. Under the 2022 Omnibus Plan, non-employee members of our board of directors and employees and officers of the Company and its affiliates, including all executive officers, are eligible to receive options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock grants, stock units, performance shares and performance units. The 2022 Omnibus Plan is currently administered by our board of directors. The total number of shares of our common stock reserved and available for grant under the 2022 Omnibus Plan is ten million (10,000,000).\nThe 2022 Omnibus Plan expires in 10 years from the date of adoption, or June 9, 2032.\nThe following summary briefly describes the principal features of the 2022 Omnibus Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2022 Omnibus Plan.\nAwards that may be granted include: (a) Incentive Stock Options, or ISOs, (b) Non-statutory Stock Options, (c) Stock Appreciation Rights, or SARs, (d) Restricted Stock, (e) Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, and (g) Performance Awards. These awards offer us and our stockholders the possibility of future value, depending on the long-term price appreciation of our common stock and the award holders continuing service with us.\nStock options give the option holder the right to acquire from us a designated number of shares of common stock at a purchase price that is fixed at the time of the grant of the option. The exercise price must generally not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted may be either incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options.\nSARs, which may be granted alone or in tandem with options, have an economic value similar to that of options. When an SAR for a particular number of shares is exercised, the holder receives a payment equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the shares under the SAR. The exercise price for SARs normally is the market price of the shares on the date the SAR is granted. Under the 2022 Omnibus Plan, holders of SARs may receive this payment - the appreciation value - either in cash or shares of common stock valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise. The form of payment will be determined by the Company.\nRestricted stock awards represent issued and outstanding shares of common stock subject to vesting criteria. RSUs represent the right to receive shares of common stock subject to satisfaction of vesting criteria. Restricted stock and the rights under RSUs are forfeitable and non-transferable until they vest. The vesting date or dates and other conditions for vesting are established when the shares are awarded.\nThe 2022 Omnibus Plan also provides for performance awards, representing the right to receive a payment, which may be in the form of cash, shares of common stock, or a combination, based on the attainment of pre-established goals.\nAll of the permissible types of awards under the 2022 Omnibus Plan are described in more detail below.\nAdministration of the 2022 Omnibus Plan. The 2022 Omnibus Plan is currently administered by our board of directors. All questions of interpretation of the 2022 Omnibus Plan, of any award agreement or of any other form of agreement or other document employed by us in the administration of the 2022 Omnibus Plan or of any award shall be determined by the board of directors, and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons having an interest in the 2022 Omnibus Plan or such award, unless fraudulent or made in bad faith. Any and all actions, decisions and determinations taken or made by the board of directors in the exercise of its discretion pursuant to the 2022 Omnibus Plan or award agreement or other agreement thereunder (other than determining questions of interpretation pursuant to the preceding sentence) shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons having an interest therein.\nEligible Recipients. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2022 Omnibus Plan are employees (including employees of affiliates and officers or directors who are also treated as employees); consultants, i.e., persons engaged to provide consulting or advisory services to the Company; and directors.\nShares Available Under the 2022 Omnibus Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2022 Omnibus Plan shall be 10,000,000 shares and shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of common stock or any combination thereof, subject to adjustment for certain corporate changes affecting the shares, such as stock splits, merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, or stock dividend. Shares subject to an award under the 2022 Omnibus Plan which are canceled, forfeited or expires again become available for grants under the 2022 Omnibus Plan.\nStock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights\nGeneral. Stock options and SARs shall be evidenced by award agreements specifying the number of shares of common stock covered thereby, in such form as the board of directors shall from time to time establish. Each stock option grant will identify the option as an ISO or Non-statutory Stock Option. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Omnibus Plan, the board of directors has the authority to determine all grants of stock options. That determination will include: (i) the number of shares subject to any option; (ii) the exercise price per share; (iii) the expiration date of the option; (iv) the manner, time and date of permitted exercise; (v) other restrictions, if any, on the option or the shares underlying the option; and (vi) any other terms and conditions as the board of directors may determine.\nExercise Price. The exercise price for each stock option or SAR shall be established in the discretion of the board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price per share for the stock option or SAR shall be not less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the effective date of grant of the stock option or SAR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a stock option or SAR may be granted with an exercise price lower than the minimum exercise price set forth above if such stock option or SAR is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner qualifying under the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code.\nExercise Terms. Stock options may be immediately exercisable but subject to repurchase or may be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by the board of directors and set forth in the award agreement evidencing such stock option. No stock option or SAR shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years after the effective date of grant of such stock option or SAR. Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by the board of directors in the grant of a stock option or SAR, any stock option or SAR granted under the 2022 Omnibus Plan shall terminate ten years after the effective date of grant of the stock option or SAR, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions. The board of directors may set a reasonable minimum number of shares of common stock that may be exercised at any one time.\nExpiration or Termination. Options, if not previously exercised, will expire on the expiration date established by the board of directors at the time of grant. In the case of incentive stock options, such term cannot exceed ten years provided that in the case of holders of more than 10% of our total combined voting stock, such term cannot exceed five years. Options will terminate before their expiration date if the holders service with our company or a subsidiary terminates before the expiration date. The option may remain exercisable for specified periods after certain terminations of employment, including terminations as a result of death, disability or retirement, with the precise period during which the option may be exercised to be established by the board of directors and reflected in the grant evidencing the award.\nIncentive Stock Options. Stock options intending to qualify as ISOs may only be granted to employees, as determined by the board of directors. No ISO shall be granted to any person if immediately after the grant of such award, such person would own common stock, including common stock subject to outstanding awards held by him or her under the 2022 Omnibus Plan or any other plan established by the Company, amounting to more than 10% of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company. To the extent that the award agreement specifies that an option is intended to be treated as an ISO, the option is intended to qualify to the greatest extent possible as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and shall be so construed; provided, however, that any such designation shall not be interpreted as a representation, guarantee or other undertaking on the part of the Company that the option is or will be determined to qualify as an ISO. If and to the extent that any shares of stock are issued under a portion of any option that exceeds the $100,000 limitation of Section 422 of the Code, such shares of common stock shall not be treated as issued under an ISO notwithstanding any designation otherwise.\nRestricted Stock Awards. A restricted stock award is a grant of shares of common stock. These awards will be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the board of directors shall determine at the date of grant, including the attainment of one or more performance criteria. Those may include requirements for continuous service and/or the achievement of specified performance goals. Restricted stock is forfeitable and generally non-transferable until it vests. The vesting date or dates and other conditions for vesting are established when the shares are awarded. Holders of restricted stock otherwise generally have the rights of stockholders of the Company, including voting and dividend rights, to the same extent as other stockholders of the Company.\nRestricted Stock Units. An RSU is a right to receive stock on a future date. The purchase price for shares of stock issuable under each RSU award shall be established by the board of directors in its discretion. Except as may be required by applicable law or established by the board of directors, no monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding) shall be required as a condition of receiving a RSU award. Shares issued pursuant to any RSU award may (but need not) be made subject to vesting conditions based upon the satisfaction of such service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, as shall be established by the board of directors and set forth in the award agreement evidencing such award.\nPerformance Awards. The board of directors shall designate the terms and conditions of each performance award, including the applicable performance criteria and performance period. Each performance award shall entitle the participant to a payment in cash or common stock upon the attainment of performance criteria and other terms and conditions specified by the board of directors. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance criteria, the amount to be paid under a performance award may be adjusted by the board of directors on the basis of such further consideration as the board of directors in its sole discretion shall determine. The board of directors may, in its discretion, substitute actual common stock for the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a participant pursuant to a performance award.\nPerformance Criteria. Under the 2022 Omnibus Plan, performance criteria means business criteria including, but not limited to: revenue; revenue growth; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings per share; operating income; pre-or after-tax income; net operating profit after taxes; economic value added (or an equivalent metric); ratio of operating earnings to capital spending; cash flow (before or after dividends); cash-flow per share (before or after dividends); net earnings; net sales; sales growth; share price performance; return on assets or net assets; return on equity; return on capital (including return on total capital or return on invested capital); cash flow return on investment; total stockholder return; improvement in or attainment of expense levels; and improvement in or attainment of working capital levels or performance criteria. Any performance criteria may be used to measure the Companys performance as a whole or any of the Companys business units and may be measured relative to a peer group or index.\nOther Material Provisions. Awards will be evidenced by a written agreement, in such form as may be approved by the board of directors. In the event of various changes to the capitalization of our company, such as stock splits, stock dividends and similar re-capitalizations, an appropriate adjustment will be made by the board of directors to the number of shares covered by outstanding awards or to the exercise price of such awards. The board of directors generally has the power to accelerate the exercise or vesting period of an award. The board of directors is also permitted to include in the written agreement provisions that provide for certain changes in the award in the event of a change of control of our company, including acceleration of vesting or payment of the value of the vested portion or, in its discretion, unvested portion of an award in cash, stock, or property. Except as otherwise determined by the board of directors at the date of grant, and subject to the terms of the 2022 Omnibus Plan, awards will not be transferable, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Prior to any award distribution, we are permitted to deduct or withhold amounts sufficient to satisfy any employee withholding tax requirements. The board of directors has the authority, at any time, to discontinue the granting of awards. The board of directors also has the authority to alter or amend the 2022 Omnibus Plan or any outstanding award or may terminate the 2022 Omnibus Plan as to further grants, provided that no amendment may be made without the approval of our stockholders to the extent that such approval is required by law or applicable rules of a securities exchange, and except as otherwise provided by the 2022 Omnibus Plan, no amendment that would adversely affect any outstanding award made under the 2022 Omnibus Plan may be made without the consent of the holder of such award.\nThe Company has issued the following stock options and stock awards under the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan as of June 30, 2023.\nPlan Category\nNumber of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights\nWeighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights\nNumber of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders\n3,091,250\n$ 0.001\n3,808,750 (1)\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n3,091,250\n$ 0.001\n3,808,750 (1)\n(1)\nAs of June 30, 2023 the Company has also approved the issuance of a total of 3,100,000 restricted stock awards in the form of shares of unregistered common stock to various officers, directors and consultants, which amount has been reduced from the total shares available under the 2022 Omnibus Plan.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn April 6, 2023, stock options to acquire 200,000 shares of common stock were exercised at $0.001 per share for cash proceeds of $200 and a total of 200,000 shares of unregistered, restricted common stock were issued to the holder.\nOn April 7, 2023 we issued 125,000 unregistered, restricted shares of common stock to one corporate subscriber under the terms of a private placement at $2.00 per share for total proceeds of $250,000.\nOn April 27, 2023 we issued 750,000 unregistered, restricted shares of common stock to two corporate subscribers under the terms of a private placement at $2.00 per share for total proceeds of $1,500,000.\nOn June 1, 2023, 2,265,000 shares of seed preferred stock were converted into 2,265,000 shares of common stock.\nThe securities sales referenced above were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as not involving a public offering, and Regulations D and S, thereunder. These sales were made without any form of general solicitation to sophisticated investors and with full access to any information requested by the investors regarding us and the securities they purchased.\nThere were no other sales of equity securities during the period covered by this Report that were not registered under the Securities Act or were not previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company.

Our plan is to build individual market impact through enhanced branding, a credible narrative, social conversation and improved accessibility by positioning all portfolio brands with a larger healing community of brands thus building exponential market impact.\nOn October 13, 2022, we concluded the acquisition of the assets and business of Los Angeles based Your Super, Inc. (Your Super) in order to capitalize on two high-growth wellness sectors: superfoods and plant-based nutrition. Your Super ranked #1 in the food and beverage category on Inc.s 2021 5,000 fastest growing company list, placing 25th overall with a three-year revenue growth of 11,477 percent and $180 million in cumulative revenue.

Your Super products do not contain any sweeteners, stevia, artificial flavors, fillers, preservatives or additives.\nOn August 4, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend a credit facility to us consisting of up to $150 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments, the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria established by an administrative agent party to the credit agreement.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the assets of Your Super, Inc., on October 27, 2022, we received a $3 million loan under the credit facility referenced above. As an inducement for the loan and for a waiver of certain terms of the credit facility with respect to this loan, we issued to the administrative agent for the credit facility a warrant for 1,560,148 shares of our seed preferred stock. In addition, Your Super HLCO LLC, our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary that we established to house the acquired assets of Your Super, Inc. and to run our new Your Super business, entered into a supplemental agreement to the credit agreement with the administrative agent of the credit facility pursuant to which Your Super HLCO LLC pledged all of its assets (being the Your Super acquired assets) to the administrative agent as collateral for the $3 million loan.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we commenced operations of our business encompassing the Your Super acquired assets. We added five employees to its US-based operations and nine employees to its European-based operations as a result of this acquisition.\nRecent Events\nOn March 3, 2023, we concluded the acquisition of certain assets of Chopra Global, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company including the Chopra App - a wellness and meditation app, certain products and services including guided meditation packages and detox kits and operation of select Chopra branded health and wellness retreats. In connection with this acquisition, we drew a further $1.873 million from our credit facility. We added 8 employees as a result of this acquisition.\nOn April 20, 2023, we amended our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to restate in its entirety Article Fourth, Section B - Preferred Stock (i) to allow for the optional conversion of our outstanding Seed Preferred Shares and (ii) to conform and correct certain provisions in Article Fourth, Section B relating primarily to the calculation of, and adjustments to, the conversion price of the Seed Preferred Shares.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022\nThe following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related changes for the years ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022.\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\n$ Change\nRevenue\n$ 8,895\n$ -\n$ 8,895\nCost of revenue\n6,905\n-\n6,905\nGross profit\n1,990\n-\n1,990\nOperating expenses\nAdvertising and marketing\n2,021\n-\n2,021\nGeneral and administrative\n10,568\n7,014\n3,554\nProfessional and consulting fees\n8,204\n7,679\nImpairment of intangible\n-\n(138\n)\nImpairment of goodwill\n3,869\n-\n3,869\nManagement fees\n1,567\nTotal operating expenses\n26,228\n8,262\n17,966\nLoss from operations before taxes\n$ (24,238 )\n$ (8,262 )\n(15,977 )\nOther income (expense)\n3,240\n-\n3,240\nInterest expense\n(669 )\n(2 )\n(666 )\nForeign currency gain (loss)\n-\nTotal Other expense\n2,930\n(2 )\n2,932\nProvisions for income taxes\n-\n-\n-\nNet loss\n$ (21,309 )\n$ (8,264 )\n(13,045 )\nRevenue\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we generated revenues of $8,895 as compared to $0 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Cost of revenue in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was $6,905 as compared to $0 in the prior comparative period. We reported gross profit of $1,990 at June 30, 2023 compared to $0 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in revenues period over period is related to our acquisition of the Your Super and Chopra wellness assets in October 2022 and March 2023.\nOperating Loss\nWe reported operating expenses of $26,228 resulting in a loss from operations of $24,238 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to operating expenses of $8,262 resulting in a loss from operations of $8,262 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The substantial increase to our current period loss is a direct result of an increase in operational expenses of $17,966, consisting of increases to general and administrative expenses of $3,554, predominantly related to stock based compensation in the current fiscal year as well as increased salaries and overhead with respect to our newly acquired operating assets, an increase to professional and consulting fees of $7,679 related to the completion of certain transactions whereby we acquired operating assets in the wellness sector, including financing fees and associated costs, goodwill impairment of $3,869, and an increase to management fees of $982 also as a result of the increase to our workforce as a result of the acquisition of new operations. In addition, during the fiscal year we incurred advertising and marketing expenses of $2,021, with no comparative expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. These increased costs were a result of our expansion into the health and wellness sector.\nOther Income / Expenses\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we recorded interest expenses of $669 compared to $2 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as well as a gain on foreign currency of $358 and other income of $3,240, with no comparative gain or income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

We had a working capital deficit of $7,116 as of June 30, 2023 compared to $6,107 as of June 30, 2022, and have reported accumulated losses to date of $29,900. We have commenced revenue generating operations in the wellness sector; however, revenues are not yet sufficient to meet ongoing operational expenditures. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend us a credit facility of up to $75,000 (which amount may be increased up to $150,000 in accordance with the terms of the agreement) in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments, the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we drew down $4,873 under the credit facility to assist in financing the acquisition of additional operating assets.\nGoing Concern\nWe had a working capital deficit of $7.1 million as of June 30, 2023. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we entered into private placement subscription agreements to raise a total of $10 million by the sale of seed preferred stock at $2 per share, of which we have collected $9.66 million. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we sold an additional 50,000 shares of seed preferred stock at $2 per share for proceeds of $0.1 million and 875,000 shares of common stock at $2 per share for proceeds of $1.75 million, all of which has been collected to date. We have commenced operations in the wellness sector initially through the acquisition of NOEO and more recently with the acquisition of the Your Super and Chopra Business assets. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders who agreed to extend a credit facility to us consisting of up to $75 million (which amount may be increased up to $150 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement) in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments), the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria. As of June 30, 2023, we have been funded $4.87 million under the terms of this agreement in order to facilitate the purchase of operating assets. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to attain profitable operations from our future planned business operations and sufficient financing to carry out those plans. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital as needed, or conduct revenue generating operations, we may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCredit Facility\nAs of September 20, 2023, we were out of compliance for the month ended August 31, 2023 with a financial covenant in our credit agreement requiring us to maintain at least $2,000,000 in unrestricted and unencumbered cash. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, our monthly EBITDA for Your Super was less than $75,000 which, under our credit agreement, resulted in a borrowing base deficiency with respect to the Your Super acquisition. These two defaults entitled our lenders, upon notice to us, to take action to enforce their rights against us including, but not limited to, demanding immediate payment of their outstanding loans to us in the principal amount of $4,873,163, as of September 30, 2023, and enforcing their liens on our Your Super and Chopra operating assets.\nOn October 12, 2023, we entered into a limited waiver to the credit agreement with our lenders, waiving the two breaches referenced above provided that (i) we regain compliance with our cash covenant referenced above no later than, and remain compliant after, November 30, 2023, and (ii) we deposit $150,000 into a special reserve collection account on behalf of the secured lenders prior to the earlier to occur of (x) November 30, 2023 and (y) the closing of a sale of our equity in an amount of not less than $2,000,000. Our failure to comply with either of these two new covenants will constitute an event of default under the credit agreement entitling our secured lenders to pursue all rights and remedies against us under the credit agreement, including acceleration of our loans, foreclosure and collection actions.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and Other factors\nWhile the World Health Organization has recently declared that the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a public health emergency of international concern and the global economy is focused on recovery, the impact of COVID-19 could continue to have an adverse impact on us going forward. COVID-19 caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which may continue to impact our ability to raise additional capital and to pursue certain acquisitions. Additional factors which may impact our ongoing operations include, but are not limited to, inflation, potential supply chain issues as a result of the aforementioned recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the recent war in the Ukraine and climate change. These events may have serious adverse impact on domestic and foreign economies which may impact our operations as a result of a variety of factors including the potential for reduced consumer spending. We are unable to predict the ongoing impact of these factors on our consolidated financial operations. There are no assurances that we will be able to meet its obligations, raise funds or conclude the acquisition of identified businesses.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\nInflation\nInflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. However, our management will closely monitor the price change and continually maintain effective cost control in operations.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities or new product introduction.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the Notes to our Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of its assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and we include any revisions to its estimates in its results for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Significant estimates in the period include the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts and other receivables, inventory allowance and impairment, valuation and useful lives of fixed assets, valuation of common stock and stock warrants, stock option valuations, imputed interest on due to related parties, and deferred tax valuation allowance.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials, work-in-process (blended superfood powder) and finished goods. Finished goods and work-in-process include direct materials, finished product kits, finished products, third-party blender and other overhead costs involved in manufacturing for e-commerce sales. We value inventory using the standard costing method whereunder product costs are allocated based on standard rates for materials, labor, and overhead. We analyze actual costs at regular intervals and accounts for any variance in its costs of goods sold. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in first-out method. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. We perform cycle counts of inventories at its warehouse and distribution center throughout the year. An allowance for inventory shrinkage is established for estimated inventory shrinkage since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets (including intangibles) acquired on October 13, 2022 and March 3, 2023, respectively. We have implemented the Business Combinations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other. Goodwill and tradename are deemed to have an indefinite life, customer/distributor relationships have a definite life of approximately 5 years and non-compete provisions with key employees have a definite life of approximately 4 years. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to, at a minimum, annual impairment tests. We expense costs to maintain or extend intangible assets as incurred.\nWe review intangible assets (with a definite life), excluding goodwill and tradenames, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nWe test goodwill, accreditation and trade names for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Amortization of customer relationships and non-compete agreements on a straight-line basis totaled $190 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. During the year ended June 30, 2023, management evaluated goodwill and recorded an impairment charge of $3,869.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock option awards granted to employees, non-employees, and directors using the accounting guidance in ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718). In accordance with ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of service-based options and performance-based options on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes pricing model. We recognize compensation expense for stock option awards over the requisite or implied service period of the grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line method over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company follows ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, five basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company generated revenues from selling its wellness products direct to customers using its owned and operated eCommerce website. The Company considers its performance obligations satisfied upon shipment and/or delivery of the purchased products to the customer. The Company evaluates returns from customers purchasing product using its eCommerce site on a case-by-case basis and generally will issue replacement product in the limited cases of product returns. The Company has no policy requiring cash refunds.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nSubsequent Events\nOn August 24, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan to reduce overhead costs by approximately 30% and eliminate workforce redundancies that resulted from the acquisitions of Your Super and Chopra earlier in the year. This plan, which resulted in the elimination of eleven full time and four part time redundant positions, took effect on August 25, 2023. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe Company's consolidated audited financial statements are stated in United States dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The consolidated audited financial statements are filed as part of this annual report starting on page.\nThe Healing Company Inc.\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Fiscal Years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nPage\nReport of Independent Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit)\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nto\nNew York Office:\n805 Third Avenue\nNew York, NY 10022\n212.838-5100\nwww.rbsmllp.com\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nThe Healing Company Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Healing Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for each of the years in the two year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses and will require additional capital to continue as a going concern. This raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statement are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nNew York, NY Washington DC Mumbai & Pune, India Boca Raton, FL\nSan Francisco, CA Las Vegas, NV Beijing, China Athens, Greece\nMember: ANTEA International with affiliated offices worldwide\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

(YS). The consideration included cash, warrants, stock and assumption of liabilities, net of assets purchased. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the intangible assets acquired, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased effort, including the need to involve fair value experts.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included, among others:\n\u00b7\nUtilization of personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in valuation to assist in; a) performing auditing procedures in under applicable standards (AS 2501), b) evaluating the reasonableness of the methodologies deployed by the valuation specialist retained by the issuer, c) evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions and estimates used in the valuation methodologies and testing the mathematical accuracy of such models, and d) conclude on the overall reasonableness of the valuation as a fair value measurement\n\u00b7\nEvaluate the reasonableness of managements significant estimates\n\u00b7\nEvaluate the events and circumstances that lead to the Goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2023.\n/s/ RBSM LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nNew York, NY\nOctober 23, 2023\nPCAOB ID Number 587\nNew York, NY Washington DC Mumbai & Pune, India Boca Raton, FL\nSan Francisco, CA Las Vegas, NV Beijing, China Athens, Greece\nMember: ANTEA International with affiliated offices worldwide\nThe Healing Company Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Stated in U.S. Dollars)\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,503\n$ 6,492\nAccounts receivable, net\n-\nPrepaid expenses\n1,309\nInventory, net\n2,681\n-\nAdvances to vendors\n-\nOther current assets\n1,951\n-\nTotal Current Assets\n7,617\n6,577\nProperty and equipment\n-\nIntangible assets, net\n-\nGoodwill\n5,036\n-\nSecurity deposits\n-\nDeferred income tax\n-\nTotal Assets\n$ 12,771\n$ 6,588\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n5,845\nAccounts payable -

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, GOING CONCERN AND HISTORY\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY\nHistorical Information\nThe Healing Company Inc. (formerly Lake Forest Minerals) a Nevada corporation, (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2008. The Company was originally formed to engage in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties of merit.\nCurrently, the Company is an emerging health and wellness company that has identified the need for a change to healthcare, where conventional medicine and alternative healing can both be drawn on to provide a world of integrated healing encompassing conventional medicine and alternative medicine.\nWith the acquisition of NOEO GmbH (NOEO) on March 10, 2022, and the onboarding of a new management team, the Company commenced operations in the health and wellness sector.\nCurrent Information\nOn September 9, 2022, the Company entered into a loan purchase and sale agreement (the Agreement) with CircleUp Credit Advisors LLC (the Seller) pursuant to which it agreed to purchase from the Seller all loans and loan accommodations (the Loan) made by the Seller to Your Superfoods, Inc. and Your Super, Inc. (together, Your Super Company). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, as consideration for purchase of the Loan, the Company made a cash payment of $2,000,000 to the Seller and issued the Seller a warrant to purchase 1,500,000 restricted shares of the Companys common stock. This warrant will begin to vest on the one-year anniversary of the closing of the purchase of the Loan with 12.5% of the Warrant amount (187,500 shares) vesting on that date and the remaining portion of the Warrant vesting in seven quarterly installments of 187,500 shares each over the next seven quarters. Vesting of the Warrant will be accelerated upon the occurrence of a sale or merger of the Company. The Warrant will terminate on the seventh anniversary of the closing date and will be subject to customary adjustments of the warrant price and number of shares for splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like.\nOn March 3, 2023, the Company and Chopra HLCO LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Chopra HLCO) (collectively the Buyer) simultaneously (i) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Chopra Global, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Seller), and solely with respect to certain specified indemnification provisions of the Purchase Agreement, Deepak Chopra, the majority member of the Seller, to acquire (the Acquisition) certain assets of the Seller (the Purchased Assets) and certain liabilities related to the Sellers business activities involving Chopra Global Digital, Chopra Global Licensing and Chopra Global Products assets (these business activities are referred to herein as the Chopra Business) and (ii) closed the Acquisition (the Closing). Following the Closing, the Purchased Assets are being held by, and the Chopra Business is being operated through, Chopra HLCO.\nThe consideration paid and payable by the Buyer for the Purchased Assets is an aggregate purchase price (the Purchase Price) of up to Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in cash plus newly issued shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock). One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) of the cash portion of the Purchase Price was paid to the Seller on March 3, 2023, along with the issuance to the Seller of One Million Four Hundred Thousand (1,400,000) shares of Common Stock (the Closing Shares). A deferred cash payment of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) was paid to the Seller prior to March 31, 2023. In addition, the Seller may receive certain Earnout payments of up to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) by way of cash and shares upon certain terms and conditions.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items which are, in the opinion of management, necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company had a working capital deficit of $7.116 million on June 30, 2023. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company entered into private placement subscription agreements to raise a total of $10 million by the sale of seed preferred stock at $2.00 per share, of which the Company has collected $9.66 million, with $0.34 million remaining to be collected. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company sold an additional 50,000 shares of seed preferred stock at $2.00 per share for proceeds of $0.1 million and 875,000 shares of common stock at $2.00 per share for proceeds of $1.75 million, all of which has been collected to date. The Company commenced operations in the wellness sector initially through the acquisition of NOEO and more recently with the acquisition of the Your Super and Chopra Business assets. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders (the Lenders) who agreed to extend a credit facility to the Company consisting of up to $150 million in accordance with the terms of the agreement in aggregate principal amount of term loan commitments (the Term Loans)), the proceeds of which may be used to acquire assets that are deemed eligible by meeting certain criteria. To date, the Company has been funded $4.87 million under the terms of this agreement to facilitate the purchase of operating assets. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to attain profitable operations from the Companys existing and planned future business operations and sufficient financing to carry out those plans. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital as needed, or conduct revenue generating operations, the Company may be required to reduce the scope, delay, or eliminate some or all of its existing and planned operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and other factors\nWhile the World Health Organization has recently declared that the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a public health emergency of international concern and the global economy is focused on recovery, the impact of COVID-19 could continue to have an adverse impact on the Company going forward. COVID-19 caused significant disruptions to the global financial markets, which may continue to impact the Companys ability to raise additional capital and to pursue certain acquisitions. Additional factors which may impact the Companys ongoing operations include, but are not limited to, inflation, potential supply chain issues as a result of the aforementioned recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the recent war in the Ukraine and climate change. These events may have serious adverse impact on domestic and foreign economies which may impact the Companys operations as a result of a variety of factors including the potential for reduced consumer spending. The Company is unable to predict the ongoing impact of these factors on the Companys consolidated financial operations. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to meet its obligations, raise funds or conclude the acquisition of identified businesses.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Healing Company and its 100% controlled subsidiaries, NOEO GmbH, NOEO, Inc., HLCO Borrower LLC, Your Super HLCO, LLC, Chopra HLCO LLC and the Your Super HLCO, LLC subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Healing Company, the Company, we, our or us is intended to mean The Healing Company, including the subsidiaries indicated above, unless otherwise indicated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of its assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and the Company includes any revisions to its estimates in its results for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Significant estimates in the period include the preliminary purchase price allocation with respect to the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Your Super Inc. and Chopra HLCO, the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts and other receivables, inventory allowance and impairment, valuation and useful lives of fixed assets, valuation of common stock and stock warrants, stock option valuations, imputed interest on due to related parties, and deferred tax valuation allowance.\nIncome and Other Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), and in accordance with taxation principles currently effective in the United States and Germany, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent they believe these assets will more-likely-than-not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nNet Loss per Common Share\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nThe table below reflects the potentially dilutive securities at the end of each reporting period.\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nSeed Preferred stock (Convertible to Common stock 1:1)\n2,620,000\n4,660,000\nSeed Preferred warrants (Convertible to Common stock 1:1)\n1,560,148\n-\nCommon stock warrants\n1,650,000\n-\nStock options\n3,091,250\n3,166,250\nTotal\n8,921,398\n7,826,250\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock option awards granted to employees, non-employees, and directors using the accounting guidance in ASC 718 Stock Compensation (ASC 718). In accordance with ASC 718, we estimate the fair value of service-based options and performance-based options on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes pricing model. We recognize compensation expense for stock option awards over the requisite or implied service period of the grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line method over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. The Company also considers amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions to be cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the Companys cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of cash held in checking accounts, and payment in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions. As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents was $1.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents with three financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not incurred any losses associated with this concentration of deposits.\nThe Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. which exceed FDIC insurance limits. FDIC insurance provides protection for bank deposits up to $250,000, so there were cumulative uninsured balances of $1.25 million and $6.25 million in the parent and its US based subsidiaries as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. There were no uninsured bank deposits with a financial institution outside the U.S. All uninsured bank deposits are held at high quality credit institutions.\nForeign currency translation and transactions\nThe Company uses the U.S. Dollar as the reporting currency for its financial statements. Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The functional currency of the Companys Germany and Netherlands subsidiaries are the local currencies. The assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into US Dollars using exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Exchange-rate differences resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Borrowings in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction and are adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses as of the balance sheet date.\nTranslation of amounts from Euro into US$ have been made at the following exchange rates for the periods ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022:\nPeriod-end Euro: US$ exchange rate\n$ 1.0915\n$ 1.0476\nPeriod-average Euro: US$ exchange rate\n$ 1.0459\n$ 1.0725\nTranslation gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are translated, as the case may be, at the rate on the date of the transaction and included in the results of operations as incurred.\nASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity, consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. When management becomes aware of circumstances that may decrease the likelihood of collection to a point where a receivable is no longer probable of being collected, it records an allowance against amounts due, which reduces the receivable to the amount that management reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers, management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific accounts. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to $109,620 and $0, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials, work-in-process (blended superfood powder) and finished goods. Finished goods and work-in-process include direct materials, finished product kits, finished products, third-party blender and other overhead costs involved in manufacturing for e-commerce sales. The Company values inventory using the standard costing method whereunder product costs are allocated based on standard rates for materials, labor, and overhead. The Company analyses actual costs at regular intervals and accounts for any variance in costs of goods sold. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in first-out method. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess, obsolete and unsaleable inventories. The allowance is an estimate based on our managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. The Company performs cycle counts of inventories at its warehouse and distribution center throughout the year. An allowance for inventory shrinkage is established for estimated inventory shrinkage since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, and depreciated over their estimated lives using the straight-line method. The useful lives of leasehold improvements are determined by the economic useful lives of the assets or the term of the leases, whichever is shorter.\nDepreciation and amortization is provided for by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\nProperty and Equipment\nEstimated Useful Life\nComputer and other equipment\n3-7 years\nOffice furniture and fixtures\n5-7 years\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of lease or useful life\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets have been retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets (including intangibles) acquired on October 13, 2022 and March 3, 2023, respectively. The Company has implemented the Business Combinations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill and tradenames are deemed to have an indefinite life, customer/distributor relationships have a definite life of approximately 5 years and non-compete provisions with key employees have a definite life of approximately 4 years. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to, at a minimum, annual impairment tests. The Company expenses costs to maintain or extend intangible assets as incurred.\nThe Company reviews intangible assets (with a definite life), excluding goodwill and tradenames, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded impairment of goodwill of $3,868,721. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded impairment of intangible assets of $138,366.\nThe Company tests goodwill, accreditation and trade names for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. There were no goodwill, accreditation or trade names impairments for the periods presented. Amortization of customer relationships and non-compete agreements on a straight-line basis totaled $189,581 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires the Company to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and asset lives, among other items.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for impairment, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows. The Company had no long-lived asset impairments as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively.\nContract Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 606-10-45-3, a contract asset is the Companys right to payment for goods and services already transferred to a customer if that right to payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The Company will recognize a contract asset when it has fulfilled a contract obligation but must perform other obligations before being entitled to payment.\nThere were no contract assets at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.\nContract Liabilities\nDeferred revenue, a contract liability, primarily consists of arrangement consideration collected in advance of order fulfillment and unsatisfied obligations related to outstanding loyalty points. The Company expects that the majority the revenue deferrals recorded at the balance sheet date will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months as performance obligations are satisfied. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue and deferred revenue. Ownership passes to customers upon shipment. Deferred revenue represents amounts collected from, or invoiced to, customers in excess of revenues recognized, primarily from the billing of annual subscription agreements. Also included in contract liabilities is the value of loyalty points with respect to the Companys loyalty program described below. The value of these contract liabilities will increase or decrease based on the timing of invoices and recognition of revenue as customers use their rewards points.\nThe Company offers a loyalty program to its customers which incorporates a points system for activities on the Companys website, such as reviews, referrals, and purchases. Customers accumulate points based on their level of spending and type of participation. The points can be redeemed for purchases of goods offered at the Companys websites. The Company defers the stand-alone selling price of earned reward points, net of rewards not expected to be redeemed (known as breakage), as liability for outstanding loyalty points. To estimate the stand-alone selling price for the points, the Company considers the stated redemption value per point dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the future breakage of reward points based on historical member activity. Upon redemption of points by customer, the Company recognizes revenue and reduces corresponding deferred revenue. The Company records breakage revenue of unredeemed points based on expected customer redemptions.\nThe Companys total contract liability balance was $2.34 million and $0 at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, of which $211,927 relates to the liability for outstanding loyalty points for Your Super and $1.34 million relates to customer subscription deposits with respect to membership fees from the Chopra wellness app which are collected in advance and amortized over the one (1) year term of the membership, advances on retreat packages and prepaid licensing fees.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company's financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contracts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, contracts receivable recourse, deferred revenue, debt and a capital lease obligation. The carrying values of the Company's financial instruments approximate fair value.\nFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820) establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 - Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs;\nLevel 2 - Significant other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data; and\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.\nThe Company believes that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value based on either their short-term nature or on terms currently available to the Company in financial markets.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company accounts for revenue contracts with customers by applying the requirements of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which includes the following five steps:\ni.\nIdentification of the contract with a customer.\nii.\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract.\niii.\nDetermination of the transaction price.\niv.\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nv.\nRecognition of revenue as the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nWhen a customer purchases product from the Company, ownership of the product transfers to them at the point of shipment and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for product sold at that time. Accordingly, the customer has control of the product purchased from the Company starting at the point of shipment. The risk of loss or damage during shipment resides exclusively with the shipping carrier and the Company assumes no obligation for loss or damage of product while in transit to the customer. As a result of this change in terms of sale, the Company recognizes revenue, including shipping revenue, when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the Companys customers, which is at the point of shipment. Sales are recorded net of returns, discounts, and any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company generates revenues from a diversified mix of e-commerce activities with the majority of revenue earned through e-commerce direct sales to consumer. The Companys e-commerce activities include the sale of organic nutritional superfood powder mixes online, through the Companys website YourSuper.com, and sales of the Chopra wellbeing line available at Chopra.com. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Companys direct to consumer sales of products accounted for 67% of total revenue.\nIn addition, the Company records revenue from the sale of memberships to the Chopra Wellbeing and Meditation App. Revenues from the membership are collected in advance and recognized over the term of the membership. Finally, the Company records net revenue in the form of commissions with respect to sales of attendance at its wellness retreats at various US based locations. Revenue for wellness retreats is deferred upon purchase and recognized at the time of the event with the transfer of services to the customer.\nThe Company records revenues from the sales on a gross basis pursuant to ASC 606-10 Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when the Company controls the specified good before it is transferred to the end customer and have the risks and rewards as principal in the transaction, such as responsibility for fulfillment, retaining the risk for collection, and establishing the price of the products. If these indicators have not been met, or if indicators of net revenue reporting specified in ASC 606-10 are present in the arrangement, revenue is recognized net of related direct costs.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs associated with the purchase of superfood products and materials and packaging for its Chopra wellness kits from third-party manufacturers. These costs include ingredients, packaging, third party manufacturing costs and freight-in shipping.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Companys provision for estimated future warranty costs is based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales. Based upon historical sales trends and warranties, it has been concluded that no warranty liability is required as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022. To date, product allowance and returns have been minimal and, based on experience, the Company believes that product returns will continue to be minimal.\nShipping and Logistics Expenses\nShipping and logistics expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to ship products to the customer. If shipping and handling activities are performed after the customer obtains control of the good, then an entity may elect to account for shipping and handling as fulfillment activities and not promised services that require further evaluation under ASC 606. If the entity elects this accounting policy, the costs related to the shipping and handling activities should be accrued when the entity recognizes revenue for the related promised goods. In addition, if this accounting policy is elected, the entity must apply it consistently to similar transactions and provide the accounting policy disclosures required by ASC 235.\nThe Company has elected to record shipping and handling activities performed after the customer obtains control of the product as fulfillment costs. These expenses are presented as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company uses the management approach to identify its reportable segments. The management approach designates the internal organization used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the basis for identifying the Companys reportable segments. Using the management approach, the Company determined that it has three operating segments: Ecommerce sales of wellness products, sales of memberships to its wellness app and operation of its wellness focused retreats.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 3.

The Companys income tax filings are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The Companys open audit periods are 2020-2023. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all the deferred tax assets for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nNOTE 16.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under supervision and with the participation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that required information to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that required information to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 14d-14(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting reliability and financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making the assessment, management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and that material weaknesses in ICFR existed as more fully described below.\nAs defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses as of June 30, 2023:\nOur internal controls and procedures are not effective for the following reasons:\n(i)\nthere has been an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives,\n(ii)\nthe Company currently has no formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process,\n(iii)\ninsufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and\n(iv)\nthe Company currently does not have an inventory tracking and valuation system in place.\nManagement's Remediation Initiatives\nAs of June 30, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, it was concluded that during the period covered by this report, the internal controls and procedures were not effective due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, management believes these weaknesses did not have a material impact on our financial results. During the course of our evaluation, we did not discover any fraud involving management or any other personnel who play a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, The Company plans to establish an Audit Committee to provide oversight of remediation efforts. Management intends to take steps to develop and enhance its internal controls over financial reporting in 2023, including:\n\u00b7\nManagement has improved segregation of duties by engaging an advisory firm to provide additional accounting and financial reporting support, and will continue to strengthen segregation of duties;\n\u00b7\nEngaging an advisory firm to lead the remediation and assessment of internal controls;\n\u00b7\nDeveloping formal policies and procedures over accounting and reporting; and\n\u00b7\nIdentifying additional information technology to improve financial reporting.\nOur management plans to establish procedures to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing necessary enhancements or improvement as cash flow and working capital permits. Management expects to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the period covered by this report, Management acquired the entity Your Super through a business combination in October 2022 and Chopra through a separate business combination in March 2023. HLCO, Inc. fully consolidates these entities on our Financial Statements. Both entities are material to the consolidated financial statements of HLCO, Inc. Given the recent acquisitions, Management excluded Your Super and Chopra from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ending June 30, 2023.\nAside from the acquisitions of Your Super and Chopra, and their exclusion from the Management assessment over internal controls, there were no changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

There are no proceedings in which its director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to its interest.\nConflicts of Interest\nOur directors are not obligated to commit their full time and attention to our business and, accordingly, they may encounter a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and those of other businesses. In the course of their other business activities, they may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as other entities to which they owe a fiduciary duty. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. They may also in the future become affiliated with entities that are engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct.\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation are required to present business opportunities to the corporation if:\n\u00b7\nthe corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;\n\u00b7\nthe opportunity is within the corporations line of business; and\n\u00b7\nit would be unfair to the corporation and its stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the corporation.\nCode of Ethics\nWe plan to adopt a code of ethics that obligates our directors, officers and employees to disclose potential conflicts of interest and prohibits those persons from engaging in such transactions without our consent. When we do adopt a code of ethics, we will disclose it in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nWe have drafted a Code of Ethics but have not motioned it for adoption because we were in the midst of reshaping our Board that would advise on such policies. Specifically, Poonacha Machiaiah and Steven Bartlett resigned from the Board and the Company added Steve Barr and Ameeth Sankaran. We plan to adopt a Code of Ethics shortly after filing.\nInsider Trading Policy\nWe intend to have our board of directors adopt an insider trading policy to promote compliance with federal and state securities laws that prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic information about a company from (i) trading in securities of that company, or (ii) providing material nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information.\nWe have drafted an Insider Trading policy but have not motioned it for adoption because we were in the midst of reshaping our Board that would advise on such policies. Specifically, Poonacha Machiaiah and Steven Bartlett resigned from the Board and the Company added Steve Barr and Ameeth Sankaran. We plan to adopt the policy shortly after filing.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur Company currently does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have any written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our current board of directors.\nOur Company does not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board of directors believes that, given the early stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our board of directors assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and makes recommendations for election or appointment.\nA shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our president at the address appearing on the first page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAudit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert\nThe board of directors has not yet formed an audit committee and its members currently perform the functions of an audit committee. We believe our board member Steven Barr has sufficient experience and educational credentials to be considered an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Mr. Barr is independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nWe believe that members of our board of directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We currently do not have formal nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our directors do not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because they believe the functions of such committees can currently be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors.

A total of $680,000 remains payable in respect to a further 340,000 shares subscribed for.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, a company affiliated with WAOWE, WAOW Advisory Group GmbH (WAOW) assumed amounts owing to AVCG in the amount of $29,999 and advanced a further $402,467 to the Company which amount was repaid in full prior to June 30, 2022.\nOn March 10, 2022, the Company acquired NOEO. At the date of the acquisition, WAOW had outstanding loans with NOEO with a remaining principal balance of EUR139,793. At June 30, 2023, the loan had a balance outstanding of $172,230 (EUR157,793) which is unsecured and accrues interest at 5% per annum, and matured on December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the loan remained in default and the Company and WAOW are currently negotiating terms of settlement. Accrued and unpaid interest at June 30, 2023 totaled $14,263 (EUR13,068), which is reflected in accounts payable - related party on the balance sheet.\nSimon Belsham, CEO and director\nOn September 1, 2022, the Company's CEO, Simon Belsham, acquired 2.5 million shares of the Company's common stock in a private secondary stock purchase transaction with Ingenious Investments AG, a corporation controlled by Wanja Oberhof, and greater than 10% shareholder, for consideration of $0.001 per share, or $2,500, as determined by a 409A valuation report.\nAnabel Oelmann, director\nOn March 10, 2022, the Company entered into and closed a share purchase agreement with Anabel Oelmann pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NOEO GmbH, a German company (NOEO), involved in direct-to-consumer brand focusing on adaptogenic herbs and currently focused on three key products which include joint, memory and digestive complexes derived from mushrooms, in exchange for cash consideration of EUR25,000 (USD$29,800). Ms. Oelmann is a director of the Company and was the sole shareholder of NOEO. Ms. Oelmanns spouse, Wanja Oberhof, is a greater than 10% shareholder of the Company, as the control person of Ingenious Investments AG and WAOW Entrepreneurship GmbH.\nAt June 30, 2023, Ms. Oelmann, through her controlled corporate entity, Trinity Holdings GmbH, was owed advances totaling $3,275 (EUR3,000) by the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, NOEO. In addition, at June 30, 2023, a total of $1,070 (EUR980) is included in accounts payable - related party, in respect to expense reimbursements owing to Ms. Oelmann.\nDirector Independence\nWe currently act with five directors on our board of directors: Kay Koplovitz (Chairperson), Simon Belsham, Anabel Oelmann, Ameeth Sankaran and Steven Barr. We have determined that Kay Koplovitz, Ameeth Sankaran and Steven Barr are independent directors as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).\nWe do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating committee, but our entire board of directors acts in such capacities. We believe that our members of our board of directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The board of directors of our company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development.\nFor purposes of determining director independence, the Company has applied the definitions set out in Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTC Markets QB tier on which our Common Stock is quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The Nasdaq definition of Independent Officer means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Company's Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. According to the Nasdaq definition, neither Jeffery Taylor nor Michael Rountree are considered an independent director of the Company. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANTS FEES AND SERVICES\nOur current independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 is RBSM, LLP of New York, New York. The aggregate fees billed or to be billed for the most recently completed fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of its annual consolidated financial statements and review of the financial statements included in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:\nYear ended:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nAudit Fees\n$ 55,000\n$ 55,725\nAudit Related Fees\n36,000\n-\nTax Fees\n-\n-\nAll Other Fees\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 91,000\n$ 55,725\nThe Company's board of directors pre-approves all services provided by its independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the Board either before or after the respective services were rendered.\nThe Company's board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by its independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining its independent auditors' independence.\nPART IV ITEM 15.
