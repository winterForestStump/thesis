    "content": "Item 1. Business\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Annual Report which address activities, events or developments, which we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words believes, intends, expects, anticipates, projects, estimates, predicts and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements include, among others, such things as:\namounts and nature of future project awards, revenue and margins from each of our segments;\nour ability to generate sufficient cash from operations, access our credit facility, or raise cash in order to meet our short and long-term capital requirements;\nour ability to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement;\nthe impact to our business from economic, market or business conditions in general and in the oil, natural gas, power, petrochemical, agricultural and mining industries in particular;\nthe impact of inflation on our operating expenses and our business operations;\nthe likely impact of new or existing regulations or market forces on the demand for our services;\nthe impact to our business of the COVID-19 pandemic and its related disruptions to supply chains, inflation and availability of materials and labor;\nour expectations with respect to the likelihood of a future impairment; and\nexpansion and other trends of the industries we serve.\nThese statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we made in light of our experience and our historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including:\nthe risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we operate in a continuously changing environment, other risk factors may emerge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur results of operations depend upon the award of new contracts and the timing of those awards.\nOur revenue is derived primarily from contracts awarded on a project-by-project basis. Generally, it is difficult to predict whether and when we will be awarded a new contract due to lengthy and complex bidding and selection processes, changes in existing or forecasted market conditions, customers' access to financing, governmental regulations, permitting and environmental matters. Because our revenue are derived from contract awards, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate materially from period to period.\nThe uncertainty associated with the timing of contract awards may reduce our short-term profitability as we balance our current capacity with expectations of future contract awards. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs to maintain an idle workforce that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Alternatively, we may decide that our long-term interests are best served by reducing our workforce and incurring increased costs associated with severance and termination benefits, which also could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred. Reducing our workforce could also impact our results of operations if we are unable to adequately staff projects that are awarded subsequent to a workforce reduction.\nDemand for our products and services is cyclical and is vulnerable to the level of capital and maintenance spending of our customers and to downturns in the industries and markets we serve, as well as conditions in the general economy.\nThe demand for our products and services depends upon the existence of construction and maintenance projects primarily in the energy markets, including LNG, hydrogen, renewable energy, midstream and downstream petroleum, and other heavy industries in the United States and Canada. Therefore, it is likely that our business will continue to be cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the United States, Canadian and world economies and negative changes in commodity and energy prices, which could adversely affect the demand for our products and services.\nThe availability of engineering and construction projects is dependent upon economic conditions and the outlook for renewable energy, hydrogen, natural gas, oil, petrochemical, industrial, and power industries, and specifically, the level of capital expenditures on energy infrastructure. Our failure to obtain projects, the delay of project awards, the cancellation of projects or delays in the execution of contracts has resulted and may continue to result in under-utilization of our resources, which could adversely impact our revenue, margins, operating results and cash flow. There are numerous factors beyond our control that influence the level of maintenance and capital expenditures of our customers, including:\nthe demand for alternative and renewable energy products, including hydrogen;\nability and demand to export LNG and other hydrocarbon products;\nthe demand for natural gas, oil and electricity;\ncurrent or projected commodity prices, including natural gas, oil, power and mineral prices;\nrefining margins;\nthe ability of energy and industrial companies to generate, access and deploy capital;\ninterest rates;\ntechnological challenges and advances;\ntax incentives, including those for alternative energy projects;\nregulatory restraints on the rates that power companies may charge their customers; and\nlocal, national and international political and economic conditions.\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization of our workforce.\nThe extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. If we under utilize our workforce, our project gross margins and overall profitability suffer in the short-term. If we over utilize our workforce, we may negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction and project execution. The utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors including:\nour estimate of the headcount requirements for various operating units based upon our forecast of the demand for our products and services;\nour ability to maintain our talent base and manage attrition;\nproductivity;\nour ability to schedule our portfolio of projects to efficiently utilize our employees and minimize downtime between project assignments; and\nour need to invest time and resources into functions such as training, business development, employee recruiting, and sales that are not chargeable to customer projects.\nAn inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and in particular, engineers, project managers, and skilled craft workers, could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, which could harm our business and impair our future revenue and profitability.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified engineers, project managers, skilled craftsmen and other experienced professionals in accordance with our need is an important factor in our ability to maintain profitability and grow our business. The market for these professionals is competitive, particularly during periods of economic growth when the supply is limited. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to retain or attract qualified personnel when needed. Therefore, when we anticipate or experience growing demand for our services, we may incur additional cost to maintain a professional staff in excess of our current contract needs in an effort to have sufficient qualified personnel available to address this anticipated demand. If we do incur additional compensation and benefit costs, our customer contracts may not allow us to pass through these costs.\nCompetent and experienced engineers, project estimators, project managers, and craft workers are especially critical to the profitable performance of our contracts, particularly on our fixed-price contracts where superior design and execution of the project can result in profits greater than originally estimated or where inferior design and project execution can reduce or eliminate estimated profits or even result in a loss.\nOur project managers are involved in most aspects of contracting and contract execution, including:\nsupervising the bidding process, including providing estimates of significant cost components, such as material and equipment needs, and the size, productivity and composition of the workforce;\nnegotiating contracts;\nsupervising project performance, including performance by our employees, subcontractors and other third-party suppliers and vendors;\nestimating costs for completion of contracts that is used to estimate amounts that can be reported as revenue and earnings on the contract under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting;\nnegotiating requests for change orders and the final terms of approved change orders; and\ndetermining and documenting claims by us for increased costs incurred due to the failure of customers, subcontractors and other third-party suppliers of equipment and materials to perform on a timely basis and in accordance with contract terms.\nThe loss of one or more of our significant customers could adversely affect us.\nOne or more customers have in the past and may in the future contribute a material portion of our revenue in any one year. Because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects or for specific periods of time, we may lose these customers from year to year as the projects or maintenance contracts are completed. The loss of business from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected fluctuations, adjustments and cancellations and does not include the full value of our long-term maintenance contracts, and therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future earnings.\nBacklog may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts included in our backlog that could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn. Many of our contracts have termination rights. Therefore, project adjustments may occur from time to time to contracts in our backlog.\nThe terms of our contracts could expose us to unforeseen costs and costs not within our control, which may not be recoverable and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant amount of our work is performed under fixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the contract for a fixed price and, as a result, can improve our expected profit by superior execution, productivity, workplace safety and other factors resulting in cost savings. However, we could incur cost overruns above the approved contract price, which may not be recoverable. Under certain incentive fixed-price contracts, we may agree to share with a customer a portion of any savings we generate while the customer agrees to bear a portion of any increased costs we may incur up to a negotiated ceiling. To the extent costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price, we may be required to absorb some or all of the cost overruns.\nFixed-price contract prices are established based largely upon estimates and assumptions relating to project scope and specifications, personnel and productivity, material needs, and site conditions. These estimates and assumptions may prove inaccurate, or conditions may change due to factors out of our control, resulting in cost overruns, which we may be required to absorb and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our profits from these contracts could decrease or we could experience losses if we incur difficulties in performing the contracts or are unable to secure fixed-pricing commitments from our manufacturers, suppliers and subcontractors at the time we enter into fixed-price contracts with our customers.\nUnder cost-plus and time-and-material contracts, we perform our services in return for payment of our agreed upon reimbursable costs plus a profit. The profit component is typically expressed in the contract either as a percentage of the reimbursable costs we actually incur or is factored into the rates we charge for labor or for the cost of equipment and materials, if any, we are required to provide. Our profit could be negatively impacted if our actual costs exceed the estimated costs utilized to establish the billing rates included in the contracts.\nWe may incur significant costs in providing services in excess of original project scope without having an approved change order.\nAfter commencement of a contract, we may perform, without the benefit of an approved change order from the customer, additional services requested by the customer that were not contemplated in our contract price for various reasons, including customer changes or incomplete or inaccurate engineering, changes in project specifications and other similar information provided to us by the customer. Our construction contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred under these circumstances.\nA failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record in the current period an adjustment to revenue and profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Any such adjustments, if substantial, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly for the period in which such adjustments are made. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, approved change orders in an amount adequate to compensate us for our additional work or expenses.\nOur business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments, which may adversely affect our overall business.\nWe perform our work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, difficult terrain, difficult site conditions and busy urban centers where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted. Performing work under these conditions can slow our progress, potentially causing us to incur contractual liability to our customers. These difficult conditions may also cause us to incur additional, unanticipated costs that we might not be able to pass on to our customers.\nWe are susceptible to severe weather conditions as a result of climate change or otherwise, which may harm our business and financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by severe weather in areas where we have significant operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\ncurtailment of services;\nsuspension of operations;\ninability to meet performance schedules in accordance with contracts and potential liability for liquidated damages;\ninjuries or fatalities;\nweather related damage to our facilities or work-in-progress on project sites;\ndisruption of information systems;\ninability to receive machinery, equipment and materials at job sites; and\nloss of productivity.\nThe frequency and severity of severe weather conditions may be enhanced by present and future changes to our climate.\nOur business has been affected by inflation, supply chain disruptions and shortages of materials and labor.\nFollowing the onset of the pandemic and with the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia in Europe, there has been a high degree of volatility in commodity and energy markets that affect our client's businesses. In addition, inflation in the United States has reached multi-decade highs and has been increasing since the beginning of the fiscal year. In some cases we have had to bid more competitively than before to win work, which has compressed margins somewhat given the higher inflation. It is uncertain how this market environment will impact our business, both positively or negatively.\nDomestic and foreign trade tariffs could raise the price and reduce the availability of raw materials to us, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nDomestic and foreign trade tariffs could raise the price and reduce the availability of raw materials such as steel plate and steel pipe, which are key materials used by us. Supplies of these materials are available throughout the United States and globally from numerous sources. We anticipate that adequate amounts of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future. However, if trade tariffs should significantly impact the price and availability of these materials, we could experience lower gross margins, operational inefficiencies and project delays.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.\nOur projects are conducted at a variety of sites including construction sites and industrial facilities. With each location, hazards are part of the day-to-day exposures that we must manage on a continuous basis to ensure our employees return home from work the same way they arrived. We understand that everyone plays a role with safety and everyone can make a difference with their active participation. With our proactive approach, our strategy is to identify the exposures and correct them before they result in an incident whether that involves an injury, damage or destruction of property, plant and equipment or an environmental impact. We are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety culture and strive for zero incidents.\nAlthough we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees, we have experienced serious accidents, including fatalities, in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Poor safety performance could also jeopardize our relationships with our customers and increase our insurance premiums.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from customers. If we experience delays and/or defaults in customer payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover amounts owed to us.\nUnder the terms of our contracts, at times we commit resources to customer projects prior to receiving payments from customers in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on these projects as they are incurred. Many of our fixed-price or cost-plus contracts require us to satisfy specified progress milestones or performance standards in order to receive a payment. Under these types of arrangements, we may incur significant costs for labor, equipment and supplies prior to receipt of payment. If the customer fails or refuses to pay us for any reason, there is no assurance we will be able to collect amounts due to us for costs previously incurred. In some cases, we may find it necessary to terminate subcontracts with suppliers engaged by us to assist in performing a contract, and we may incur costs or penalties for canceling our commitments to them. Delays in customer payments require an investment in working capital. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us under our contracts, we may be required to record a charge against previously recognized earnings related to the project, and our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe contribute to multiemployer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or if we withdraw from those plans.\nWe contribute to several multiemployer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multiemployer plan in the event of the employers withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. If we terminate, withdraw, or partially withdraw from other multiemployer pension plans, we could be required to make significant cash contributions to fund that plan's unfunded vested benefit, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; however, we are not currently able to determine the net assets and actuarial present value of the multiemployer pension plans unfunded vested benefits allocable to us, if any, and we are not presently aware of the amounts, if any, for which we may be contingently liable if we were to withdraw from any of these plans. In addition, if the funding level of any of these multiemployer plans becomes classified as critical status under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.\nA failure or outage in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use numerous technologies to help run our operations, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any cyber security attack that affects our facilities, our systems, our customers and any of our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a cyber-attack on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may damage our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. Such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber-attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.\nAny security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to us in investigation, remediation, legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches. For example, laws may require notification to regulators, clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. A cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers. Furthermore, a material security breach could cause us to lose revenue, lose clients or cause damage to our reputation.\nTo reduce organizational risk from cybersecurity threats, we carry cyber liability insurance and have undertaken several initiatives in recent years. We strengthened our identity and access management capabilities by requiring multi-factor authentication, increased the threat detection efficiencies within our security information and event management capacity, and completed projects designed to reduce our organization's external attack surface. In addition, in the area of security awareness\nand training, we have updated our foundational curriculum, established mandatory recurring training requirements, and commenced periodic phishing campaign assessments.\nWe rely on internally and externally developed software applications and systems to support critical functions including project management, estimating, scheduling, human resources, accounting, and financial reporting. Any sudden loss, disruption or unexpected costs to maintain these systems could significantly increase our operational expense as well as disrupt the management of our business operations.\nWe rely on various software systems to conduct our critical operating and administrative functions. We depend on our software vendors to provide long-term software maintenance support for our information systems. Software vendors may decide to discontinue further development, integration or long-term software maintenance support for our information systems, in which case we may need to abandon one or more of our current information systems and migrate some or all of our project management, human resources, estimating, scheduling, accounting and financial information to other systems, thus increasing our operational expense as well as disrupting the management of our business operations.\nFinancial Risks\nOur borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement is determined by the size of our borrowing base and if the size of our borrowing base does not provide adequate liquidity, then we may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our strategic plan.\nManagement believes it has sufficient cash on hand and will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund the business. However, should we require additional liquidity, there is risk that we will be unable access the amount of additional liquidity needed from our Credit Agreement if the level of assets included in the borrowing base is insufficient. The borrowing base includes restricted cash plus a percentage of the value of certain accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, reduced for certain reserves.\nTo the extent that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement are insufficient to make future investments, or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are satisfactory to us. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments or respond to competitive challenges.\nOur Credit Agreement imposes restrictions that may limit business alternatives.\nOur Credit Agreement prohibits or limits us from making acquisitions, repurchasing equity, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets, or making other distributions, including cash dividends. In addition, our Credit Agreement requires that we comply with a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant under certain conditions. These covenants and restrictions may impact our ability to effectively execute operating and strategic plans and our operating performance may not be sufficient to comply with the required covenants.\nOur failure to comply with one or more of the covenants in our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default. We can provide no assurance that a default could be remedied, or that our creditors would grant a waiver or further amend the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nAccounting Risks\nOur use of percentage-of-completion accounting for fixed-price contracts and our reporting of profits for cost-plus contracts prior to contract completion could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.\nRevenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under percentage-of-completion accounting, contract revenue and earnings are recognized ratably over the contract term based on the proportion of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. In addition, some contracts contain penalty provisions for failure to achieve certain milestones, schedules or performance standards. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on a monthly basis. As a result, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of changes in cost estimates, change orders to the original contract, or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred by us due to customer-induced delays and other factors.\nIf estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss, a provision is made to accrue the total loss anticipated in the period the loss is determined. Contract profit estimates are also adjusted, on a percentage of completion basis, in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment is required. No restatements are made to prior periods. Further, many of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts, and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded on a percentage of completion basis in the period when estimable and probable.\nAs a result of the requirements of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, the possibility exists that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several prior periods and later determine, as a result of additional information, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be recognized in the period in which such change in estimate occurs.\nActual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions, as of the date of the financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimation by our management include:\ncontract costs and application of percentage-of-completion accounting;\nprovisions for uncollectable receivables from customers for invoiced amounts;\nthe amount and collectability of unpriced change orders and claims against customers;\nprovisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances;\nrecoverability of goodwill and intangible assets;\nvaluation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations; and\naccruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves.\nOur actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nEarnings for future periods may be affected by impairment charges.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We perform annual goodwill impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of every fiscal year. In addition, we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible or fixed asset may not be recoverable. As of June 30, 2022, we had $4.8 million of amortizing intangible assets and $42.1 million of non-amortizing goodwill representing 1.1% and 9.6% of our total assets, respectively.\nLegal, Insurance, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are involved, and are likely to continue to be involved in legal proceedings, which will increase our costs and, if adversely determined, could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are currently a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the operation of our business, and it is reasonable to expect that we would be named in future actions. Many of the actions against us arise out of the normal course of performing services on project sites, and include workers compensation claims, personal injury claims and contract disputes with our customers. From time to time, we are also named as a defendant for actions involving the violation of federal and state labor laws related to employment practices, wages and benefits. We may also be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers seeking to recover payment of contractual amounts due to us as well as claims for increased costs incurred by us resulting from, among other things, services performed by us at the request of a customer that are in excess of original project scope that are later disputed by the customer and customer-caused delays in our contract performance.\nWe maintain insurance against operating hazards in amounts that we believe are customary in our industry. However, our insurance policies include deductibles and certain coverage exclusions, so we cannot provide assurance that we are adequately insured against all of the risks associated with the conduct of our business. A successful claim brought against us in excess of, or outside of, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nLitigation, regardless of its outcome, is expensive, typically diverts the efforts of our management away from operations for varying periods of time, and can disrupt or otherwise adversely impact our relationships with current or potential customers, subcontractors and suppliers. Payment and claim disputes with customers may also cause us to incur increased interest costs resulting from incurring indebtedness under our revolving line of credit or receiving less interest income resulting from fewer funds invested due to the failure to receive payment for disputed claims and accounts.\nOur projects expose us to potential professional liability, product liability, pollution liability, warranty and other claims, which could be expensive, damage our reputation and harm our business. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance to cover these claims.\nWe perform construction and maintenance services at large industrial facilities where accidents or system failures can be disastrous and costly. Any catastrophic occurrence in excess of our insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by us or where our products are installed or services performed could result in significant professional liability, product liability, warranty and other claims against us by our customers, including claims for cost overruns and the failure of the project to meet contractually specified milestones or performance standards. Further, the rendering of our services on these projects could expose us to risks and claims by third parties and governmental agencies for personal injuries, property damage and environmental matters, among others. Any claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in substantial costs, divert managements attention and create negative publicity, particularly for claims relating to environmental matters where the amount of the claim could be extremely large. We may not be able to or may choose not to obtain or maintain insurance coverage for the types of claims described above. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against the claims described above, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEmployee, subcontractor or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, subcontractors or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with safety standards, laws and regulations, customer requirements, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, since our internal controls are subject to inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nEnvironmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning emissions into the air; discharges into waterways; generation, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous material and wastes; and health and safety.\nOur projects often involve highly regulated materials, including hazardous wastes. Environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for regulated materials and require us to obtain permits and comply with various other requirements. The improper characterization, handling, or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure by us to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits could subject us to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to operate our business and complete contracted projects.\nIn addition, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and comparable state and foreign laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated materials. CERCLA and the comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release, and liability for the entire cost of clean-up can be imposed upon any responsible party.\nWe are subject to numerous other laws and regulations including those related to business registrations and licenses, environment, workplace, employment, health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. It is impossible to predict the effect on us of any future changes to these laws and regulations. We can provide no absolute assurance that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations\nor that the costs to comply with these laws and regulations and/or a failure to comply with these laws will not significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in reduced demand for our services and products.\nThere has been an increased focus in the last several years on climate change in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives as well as pressure from institutional investors to restrict the emission of greenhouse gases. The growing imperative on customers for whom we provide services to limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect demand for our products and services. Further, scientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. Such climate events have the potential to adversely affect our operations or those of our customers, which in turn could have a negative effect on us.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our customers, vendors, and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our operations are conducted outside the United States, and accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, instability in political or economic conditions, difficulty in repatriating cash proceeds, differing employee relations, differing regulatory environments, trade protection measures, and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAcquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses, and unidentified liabilities and risks associated with entering new markets. We may also be unable to profitably integrate and operate these businesses.\nAny future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses, unexpected liabilities and other risks in addition to the integration and consolidation risks. If we make any future acquisitions, we will likely assume liabilities of the acquired business or have exposure to contingent liabilities that may not be adequately covered by insurance or indemnification, if any, from the former owners of the acquired business. These potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may also not be able to successfully complete our ongoing integration of the operations, personnel and technology from our acquisitions. Because of their size and complexity, if we fail to complete our integration efforts successfully, we may experience interruptions in our business activities, a decrease in the quality of our services, a deterioration in our employee and customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our integration activities have required significant attention from management, which potentially decreases the time that management may devote to serve existing customers, attract new customers and develop new services and strategies. We may also experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. The integration efforts may also impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects. We will have to actively strive to demonstrate to our existing customers that these integrations have not resulted in adverse changes\nin our standards or business focus. Our acquisitions have involved a significant capital commitment, and the return that we achieve on any capital invested may be less than the return achieved on our other projects or investments. There will be challenges in consolidating and rationalizing information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures. In addition, any delays or increased costs of integrating acquired companies could adversely affect our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nWe may not realize the growth opportunities, operating margins and synergies that are anticipated from acquisitions.\nThe benefits we expect to achieve as a result of an acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities, operating margins and synergies. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities, operating margins and synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the acquired business and operations with our existing business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate existing and acquired businesses successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities, operating margins and synergies we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. Accordingly, the benefits from an acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies, which could cause our revenue assumptions and operating margin to be inaccurate.\nWe face substantial competition in each of our business segments, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face competition in all areas of our business from regional, national and international competitors. Our competitors range from small, family-owned businesses to well-established, well-financed entities, both privately and publicly held, including many large engineering and construction companies and specialty contractors. We compete primarily on the basis of price, customer satisfaction, safety performance and programs, quality of our products and services, and schedule. As a result, an increase in the level of competition in one or more markets may result in lower operating margins than we have recently experienced.\nOur common stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations could continue in the future, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid.\nThe market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including the following:\nthe risk factors described in this Item 1A;\ngeneral conditions in our customers industries;\ngeneral conditions in the security markets;\nthe significant concentration of ownership of our common stock in the hands of a small number of institutional investors;\na shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors; and\nchanges in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry.\nSome companies that have volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to security class action suits filed against them. If a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that these sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, which could lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding stock.\nThe issuance of additional common stock, restricted stock units or securities convertible into our common stock could result in dilution of the ownership interest held by existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, which may give other stockholders dividend, conversion, voting, and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. In addition, we are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, a significant number of additional shares of our common stock and securities convertible into either common stock or preferred stock.\nShareholder activists could cause a disruption to our business.\nAn activist investor may indicate disagreement with our strategic direction or capital allocation policies and may seek representation on our Board of Directors. Our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected and may result in, among other things:\nincreased operating costs, including increased legal expenses, insurance, administrative expenses and associated costs incurred in connection with director election contests;\nuncertainties as to our future direction, which could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and could make it more difficult to attract, retain, or motivate qualified personnel, and strain relationships with investors and customers; and\nreduction or delay in our ability to effectively execute our current business strategy and to implement new strategies.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party to a number of legal proceedings. We believe that the nature and number of these proceedings are typical for a company of our size engaged in our type of business and that none of these proceedings will result in a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or liquidity. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nSection 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") requires domestic mine operators to disclose violations and orders issued under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the \"Mine Act\") by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. We do not act as owner of any mines, but as a result of our performing services or construction at mine sites as an independent contractor, we may be considered an \"operator\" within the meaning of the Mine Act.\nInformation concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required to be disclosed in this annual report under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol \"MTRX\". Substantially all of our stockholders maintain their shares in \"street name\" accounts and are not individually stockholders of record. As of September 30, 2022, there were 19 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and the terms of our Credit Agreement limit dividends to stock dividends only (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt for more information about our Credit Agreement). Any future dividend payments will depend on the terms of our Credit Agreement, our financial condition, capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe may repurchase common stock pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program, which was approved by the board of directors in November 2018. Under the program, the aggregate number of shares repurchased may not exceed 2,707,175 shares. We may repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are not obligated to purchase any shares. The program will continue unless and until it is modified or revoked by the Board of Directors. We made no repurchases under the program in fiscal 2022 and have no current plans to repurchase stock. As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,349,037 shares available for purchase under the Stock Buyback Program. The terms of our Credit Agreement limit share repurchases to $2.5 million per fiscal year provided that that we meet certain availability thresholds and do not violate our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following Performance Graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.\nThe following graph compares, for the period from June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2022, the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Heavy Construction Index.\nThe graph below assumes an investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) in our common stock, the NASDAQ Composite Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Heavy Construction Index on June 30, 2017 and tracks their relative performance through June 30, 2022.

Reserved Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies. The following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies, estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of GAAP.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReportable Segments\nWe operate our business through three reportable segments:\nUtility and Power Infrastructure: consists of power delivery services provided to investor-owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, transmission and distribution line installations, upgrades and maintenance, as well as emergency and storm restoration services. We also provide engineering, fabrication, and construction services for LNG utility peak shaving facilities, and construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, including natural gas fired facilities, in simple or combined cycle configuration.\nProcess and Industrial Facilities: primarily serves customers in the downstream and midstream petroleum industries who are engaged in refining crude oil and processing, fractionating, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. We also serve customers in various other industries such as petrochemical, sulfur, mining and minerals companies engaged primarily in the extraction of non-ferrous metals, aerospace and defense, cement, agriculture, and other industrial customers. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, industrial cleaning services, engineering, fabrication, and capital construction.\nStorage and Terminal Solutions: consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks and terminals. We also include work related to cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals, including LNG, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum, hydrogen and other specialty vessels such as spheres in this segment, as well work related to marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication, construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer tank products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.\nOverview\nThe majority of the work for all segments is performed in the United States, with 9.5% of revenue generated internationally during fiscal 2022, 10.2% in fiscal 2021 and 7.3% in fiscal 2020. The percentage of revenue generated internationally decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher levels of revenue generated domestically.\nSignificant period to period changes in revenue, gross profits and operating results between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are discussed below on a consolidated basis for each segment. A discussion of results of operations changes between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on September 13, 2021.\nMatrix Service Company\nResults of Operations\n(In thousands)\nUtility and Power Infrastructure Process and Industrial Facilities Storage and Terminal Solutions Corporate Total\nFiscal Year 2022\nConsolidated revenue $ 220,093 $ 254,848 $ 232,839 $ - $ 707,780\nGross profit (loss) (8,586) 9,270 262 (2,152) (1,206)\nGross profit (loss) % (3.9) % 3.6 % 0.1 % - % (0.2) %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 11,771 12,506 17,284 26,129 67,690\nGoodwill impairment and restructuring costs 2,746 6,867 7,330 2,015 18,958\nOperating loss (23,103) (10,103) (24,352) (30,296) (87,854)\nOperating loss % (10.5) % (4.0) % (10.5) % - % (12.4) %\nFiscal Year 2021\nConsolidated revenue $ 210,052 $ 199,917 $ 263,429 $ - $ 673,398\nGross profit 1,506 17,642 13,617 - 32,765\nGross profit % 0.7 % 8.8 % 5.2 % - % 4.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 9,882 14,756 18,644 26,474 69,756\nRestructuring costs 1,312 3,807 1,391 246 6,756\nOperating loss (9,688) (921) (6,418) (26,720) (43,747)\nOperating loss % (4.6) % (0.5) % (2.4) % - % (6.5) %\nVariances Fiscal Year 2022 to Fiscal Year 2021 Increase/(Decrease)\nConsolidated revenue $ 10,041 $ 54,931 $ (30,590) $ - $ 34,382\nGross profit (loss) (10,092) (8,372) (13,355) (2,152) (33,971)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,889 (2,250) (1,360) (345) (2,066)\nGoodwill impairment and restructuring costs 1,434 3,060 5,939 1,769 12,202\nOperating loss (13,415) (9,182) (17,934) (3,576) (44,107)\nOperational Update\nBidding activity, project award volumes, and revenue volumes all improved in fiscal 2022 as the economy recovered from the pandemic. However, delays in project starts on certain projects in our backlog as well as delays in awards of larger projects have negatively impacted our operating results. Therefore, we have not been able to generate enough revenue to fully recover construction overhead and SG&A costs despite significant reductions in our cost structure. In addition, projects bid during a competitive environment and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects have further pressured profitability during the fiscal year (see the discussion of our fiscal 2022 results, and Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2 - Revenue - Revisions in Estimates, for more information). Based on improving market conditions and strong bidding activity, we are expecting project awards to increase into fiscal 2023, which we expect to lead to higher revenue volume, increased cost leverage, better margins, and improved earnings.\nIn fiscal 2022, we commenced the second phase of our ongoing business improvement plan to focus on centralization of support functions, including business development, accounting, human resources, procurement and project services into shared service centers. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, we estimate that we have reduced our cost structure by approximately $83 million, or approximately 30%, with approximately one-third of those reductions related to SG&A and the rest related to construction overhead, which is included in cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information about our business improvement plan.\nIn order to more clearly depict our core profitability, the following tables present our operating results after certain adjustments:\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)(1)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nNet loss, as reported $ (63,900) $ (31,224) $ (33,074)\nRestructuring costs incurred 646 6,756 14,010\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairments 18,312 - 38,515\nGain on sale of facilities(2)\n(32,392) - -\nAccelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees(3)\n1,518 - -\nDeferred tax valuation allowance(4)\n17,943 - -\nTax impact of adjustments and other net tax items 4,464 (1,739) (8,644)\nAdjusted net income (loss) $ (53,409) $ (26,207) $ 10,807\nLoss per fully diluted share, as reported $ (2.39) $ (1.18) $ (1.24)\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share $ (2.00) $ (0.99) $ 0.40\n(1)This table presents non-GAAP financial measures of our adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The most directly comparable financial measures are net loss and loss per fully diluted share, respectively, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We have presented these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they more clearly depict our core operating results during the periods presented and provide a more comparable measure of our operating results to other companies considered to be in similar businesses. Since adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per fully diluted share are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n(2)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\n(3)Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information).\n(4)See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\nWe have presented Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as net loss before goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, restructuring costs, gain on sale of facilities, stock-based compensation, interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. We believe that the line item on our Consolidated Statements of Income entitled Net loss is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure is not a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. As Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain financial information compared with net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded. Our non-GAAP performance measure, Adjusted EBITDA, has certain material limitations as follows:\nIt does not include impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. While impairments to intangible assets are non-cash expenses in the period recognized, cash or other consideration was still transferred in exchange for the intangible assets in the period of the acquisition. Any measure that excludes impairments to intangible assets has material limitations since these expenses represent the loss of an asset that was acquired in exchange for cash or other assets.\nIt does not include gain on sale of facilities. While the sale occurred outside the normal course of business and similar sales are not expected to be recurring or sustainable, any measure that excludes this gain has inherent limitations since the sale resulted in a material inflow of cash.\nIt does not include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs represent material costs that we incurred and are oftentimes cash expenses. Therefore, any measure that excludes restructuring costs has material limitations.\nIt does not include stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation represents material amounts of equity that are awarded to our employees and directors for services rendered. While the expense is non-cash, we release vested shares out of our treasury stock, which has historically been replenished by using cash to periodically repurchase our stock. Therefore, any measure that excludes stock-based compensation has material limitations.\nIt does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations and to acquire businesses, pay commitment fees to maintain our senior secured revolving credit facility, and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility, interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue. Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations.\nIt does not include income taxes. Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations, any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations.\nIt does not include depreciation or amortization expense. Because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure. Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations.\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(in thousands)\nNet loss $ (63,900) $ (31,224) $ (33,074)\nGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment 18,312 - 38,515\nGain on sale of facilities(1)\n(32,392) - -\nRestructuring costs 646 6,756 14,010\nStock-based compensation 7,877 8,156 9,877\nInterest expense 2,951 1,559 1,597\nProvision (benefit) for federal, state and foreign income taxes 5,617 (12,039) (3,570)\nDepreciation and amortization 15,254 17,858 19,124\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (45,635) $ (8,934) $ 46,479\n(1)Gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.)\nFiscal 2022 Versus Fiscal 2021\nConsolidated\nConsolidated revenue was $707.8 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $673.4 million in fiscal 2021. On a segment basis, revenue increased in the Process and Industrial Facilities and Utility and Power Infrastructure segments by $54.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $30.6 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated gross profit (loss) was ($1.2) million in fiscal 2022 compared to $32.8 million in fiscal 2021. Gross margin (loss) was (0.2)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2021. Gross margins in fiscal 2022 were negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. In addition, the competitive bidding environment and increased forecasts in costs to complete projects negatively impacted gross margins. Gross margins in fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by lower than forecasted volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs, lower than previously forecasted margins on large capital projects in the Utility and Power Infrastructure and Storage and Terminal Solutions segments, and an unfavorable settlement on a contract dispute in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses were $67.7 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $69.8 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to implemented cost reductions.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded $18.3 million of goodwill impairment. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill, for more information about the impairments.\nAs a result of actions taken to reduce our cost structure, we recorded $0.6 million of restructuring costs in fiscal 2022. These costs were net of a $1.6 million credit recorded in restructuring costs in the third quarter. The credit was due to a favorable settlement of a restructuring obligation related to our exit from the domestic iron and steel industry in fiscal 2020. See \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section and Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 - Restructuring Costs, for more information.\nInterest expense was $3.0 million in fiscal 2022 and $1.6 million in fiscal 2021. Interest expense in fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees in the first quarter (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information.) The remaining interest expense in fiscal 2022 was comprised of letter of credit fees, unused capacity fees, interest on outstanding advances, and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nOther income included a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was (9.6)% compared to 27.8% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2022 was primarily impacted by a $17.9 million valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax assets. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the valuation allowance. The effective tax rate during fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by a provision of the CARES Act that allowed us to carryback $5.2 million of the fiscal 2021 net operating loss to a period with a higher statutory federal income tax rate. The carryback benefit was offset by $2.8 million of valuation allowances on various deferred tax assets and $1.8 million of excess tax expense related to the vesting of stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, net loss was $63.9 million and $31.2 million, respectively; or $2.39 and $1.18 per fully diluted share, respectively.\nUtility and Power Infrastructure\nRevenue for the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment was $220.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $210.1 million in fiscal 2021. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes of power generation and power delivery work, partially offset by lower volumes of natural gas utility peak shaving and storm response service work.\nThe segment gross margin (loss) was (3.9)% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.7% in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was materially impacted by changes in the forecasted costs to complete two large capital projects. Improved execution on the first project resulted in an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million during the second half of fiscal 2022. However, increases in the forecasted costs to complete this project during the first half of fiscal 2022 resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $3.6 million during the year. The increase in forecasted costs during the first half of the fiscal year was principally due to unexpected equipment repairs during commissioning that delayed the scheduled completion and increased the estimated costs to complete. We achieved a critical performance milestone during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which significantly reduced our financial exposure on the project.\nIncreased forecasted costs to the complete the second project resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2022. We recognized $78.1 million of revenue on this project during the year at a near break-even margin as a result of the change in estimate. The increase in forecasted costs was the result of higher than anticipated subcontractor costs and labor costs as the project neared completion. We expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was also negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs, and by an unfavorable settlement of a claim with a customer in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nResults of operations in fiscal 2021 were materially impacted by increases in the forecasted costs to complete a large capital project. This project reduced gross profit by $5.8 million in fiscal 2021. The changes in estimate were due to lower than previously forecasted productivity caused by excessive rain at the project site, the impact of COVID-19, and rework which led to higher costs and schedule compression. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs. These negative impacts were partially offset by good project execution in the remainder of the segment.\nProcess and Industrial Facilities\nRevenue for the Process and Industrial Facilities segment was $254.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $199.9 million in fiscal 2021. The increase of $54.9 million is primarily due to higher levels of refinery maintenance and turnaround work.\nThe segment gross margin was 3.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to 8.8% in fiscal 2021. Despite generally strong project execution and higher volumes, the segment gross margin in fiscal 2022 was negatively impacted by an increase in forecasted costs to complete a midstream gas processing project. The project reduced gross profit by $8.7 million during fiscal 2022. The increase in forecasted costs was primarily due to poor performance of a now terminated subcontractor, which required rework, as well as supply chain and escalation issues, in order to meet our client's expectations. Segment gross margin was also negatively impacted by under recovered construction overhead costs in fiscal 2022.\nSegment gross margin in fiscal 2021 was positively impacted by strong project execution and the positive impact of a one-time workers' compensation item recorded in the second quarter, but these positive impacts were partially offset by lower revenue volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nStorage and Terminal Solutions\nRevenue for the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment was $232.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $263.4 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $30.6 million. The decrease in segment revenue is primarily a result of lower volumes of crude oil tank and terminal capital work.\nThe segment gross margin was 0.1% in fiscal 2022 compared to 5.2% in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by low revenue volume, which led to under recovery of construction overhead costs and a lower than previously forecasted margin on a thermal energy storage tank repair and maintenance project due to changes in repair scope, expanded client weld testing and associated schedule delays, which reduced segment gross profit by $6.3 million. In addition, segment gross margin was negatively impacted by smaller competitively priced capital projects.\nThe fiscal 2021 segment gross margin was negatively impacted by increases in the costs to complete a large crude oil terminal project, partially offset by an increase in the estimated recovery of those costs. During the third quarter, we achieved mechanical completion on the project, demobilized and completed our assessment of unpriced change orders. The project's financial impact for fiscal 2021 was a $3.8 million reduction to gross profit. In addition, a settlement on a contract dispute over the construction of a crude oil terminal negatively impacted gross profit by $2.9 million in the fourth quarter. The settlement resulted in a cash receipt of $8.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which enabled us to avoid future legal costs and litigation risk. Fiscal 2021 gross margin was also negatively impacted by low volume, which led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs.\nCorporate\nUnallocated corporate expenses were $30.3 million during fiscal 2022 compared to $26.7 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs for outstanding litigation (see Item 8. Financial Statements, Note 7 - Commitment and Contingencies, for more information), third party consulting services and centralization of support costs related to restructuring activities (see \"Operational Update\" in this Results of Operations section), partially offset by cost reductions we implemented.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nWe define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations. Our primary sources of liquidity at June 30, 2022 were unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand, capacity under our ABL Facility (see \"ABL Credit Facility\" in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Debt, for more information), and cash generated from operations. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 totaled $52.4 million and availability under the ABL Facility totaled $42.5 million, resulting in total liquidity of $94.8 million.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 52,371 $ 83,878\nRestricted cash $ 25,000 -\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows $ 77,371 $ 83,878\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our liquidity for the year ended June 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nLiquidity at June 30, 2021 $ 83,878\nCash used by operating activities (54,196)\nCapital expenditures (3,345)\nProceeds from asset sales(1)\n39,018\nNet borrowings under ABL Facility 15,000\nRemaining availability under ABL Facility 42,460\nCash restricted in support of ABL Facility (25,000)\nCash used by other financing activities (2,301)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (683)\nLiquidity at June 30, 2022 $ 94,831\n(1)Includes $37.4 million of proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. See Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information. The remaining asset sales comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the near- and intermediate-term business impacts from supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the dislocation of certain energy and industrial markets following the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the war between Ukraine and Russia. During fiscal 2022, low revenue volume, a competitive bidding environment, and increased forecasted costs to complete certain projects led to a $54.2 million use of cash by operating activities, which negatively impacted our liquidity position. However, we improved our liquidity position by entering into a sale-leaseback transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which resulted in $37.4 million in proceeds (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) In addition, we added $32.5 million of liquidity as a result of entering into the ABL Facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nWe continue to maintain adequate liquidity to support our near- to intermediate-term needs. We are taking the following actions:\nstrategic review of business processes and organizational structure;\nproactive management of the cost structure and working capital; and\neliminating all non-critical capital expenditures.\nFactors that routinely impact our short-term liquidity and may impact our long-term liquidity include, but are not limited to:\nchanges in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs due to contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings:\n\u25e6some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers;\n\u25e6some fixed price customer contracts allow for significant upfront billings at the beginning of a project, which temporarily increases liquidity near term;\n\u25e6time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears. Therefore, we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected; and\n\u25e6some of our large construction projects may require security in the form of letters of credit or significant retentions. The timing of collection of retentions is often uncertain;\nother changes in working capital; and\ncapital expenditures.\nOther factors that may impact both short and long-term liquidity include:\ncontract disputes, which can be significant;\ncollection issues, including those caused by weak commodity prices, economic slowdowns or other factors which can lead to credit deterioration of our customers;\nissuances of letters of credit; and\nstrategic investments in new operations.\nOther factors that may impact long-term liquidity include:\nborrowing constraints under our credit facility and maintaining compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement;\nacquisitions and disposals of businesses; and\npurchases of shares under our stock buyback program.\nCash Flows Used by Operating Activities\nCash flows used by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 totaled $54.2 million. Major components of cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 are as follows:\nNet Cash Used by Operating Activities\n(In thousands)\nFiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2022\nNet loss $ (63,900)\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment (1)\n(33,114)\nGoodwill impairment 18,312\nDepreciation and amortization 15,254\nStock-based compensation expense 7,877\nDeferred income tax 5,358\nOther non-cash expenses 2,425\nCash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities (6,408)\nNet cash used by operating activities $ (54,196)\n(1)Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment includes a $32.4 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facility located in Orange, California (see Part II. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The remaining gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment comprised of equipment sold in the normal course of business.\nCash effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities at June 30, 2022 in comparison to June 30, 2021 include the following:\nAccounts receivable, excluding credit losses recognized during the period, increased $6.6 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. The variance is primarily attributable to higher business volume and the timing of billing and collections.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts (\"CIE\") increased $14.0 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings (\"BIE\") increased $11.3 million, which increased cash flows from operating activities. CIE and BIE balances can experience significant fluctuations based on business volume and the timing of when job costs are incurred and the timing of customer billings and payments.\nInventories, income taxes receivable, other current assets, operating right-of-use lease assets and other non-current assets increased $1.1 million during fiscal 2022, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. These operating assets can fluctuate based on the timing of inventory builds and draw-downs, accrual and receipt of income taxes receivable, prepayments of certain expenses, leasing activity, business volume, and other timing differences.\nAccounts payable, accrued wages and benefits, accrued insurance, operating lease liabilities and other accrued expenses increased by $12.2 million during fiscal 2022, which increased cash flows from operating activities. These operating liabilities can fluctuate based on the timing of vendor payments, accruals, leasing activities, business volume, and other timing differences.\nOther liabilities decreased by $7.4 million, which decreased cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was primarily due to payment on the deferred payroll tax liability associated with the CARES Act. See Part II., Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 - Income Taxes for more information.\nCash Flows Provided by Investing Activities\nInvesting activities provided $35.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to $39.0 million of asset sales, including $37.4 million in proceeds from the sale-leaseback of our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facilities located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (see Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment - Sale-leaseback Transaction, for more information.) The asset sale proceeds were partially\noffset by $3.3 million of capital expenditures. Capital expenditures consisted of $1.5 million for facilities, office equipment and software, and $1.8 million for construction, fabrication, and transportation equipment.\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $12.7 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to the net borrowings of $15.0 million under our ABL Facility, partially offset by $1.3 million paid in fees to enter into the ABL Facility, and $0.9 million paid to repurchase our stock for payment of withholding taxes due on equity-based compensation.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn October 5, 2022, we and our primary U.S. and Canada operating subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement (the Amendment), which amended our asset-backed credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), dated as of September 9, 2021 with Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and a Letter of Credit Issuer, and the lenders named therein. The Amendment (i) waives an event of default resulting from our failure to deliver the Administrative Agent and the lenders our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 by September 28, 2022 (the Audited Financial Statements), provided we deliver the Audited Financial Statements by October 14, 2022, (ii) reduces the maximum amount of loans under the ABL Facility to $90.0 million from $100.0 million and (iii) replaces the London interbank offered rate with the forward term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (the SOFR) as the interest rate benchmark.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our remaining U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. The ABL Facility available borrowings may be increased by an amount not to exceed $15.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments. The ABL Facility is intended to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, issuances of letters of credit and other lawful purposes. Our obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first lien on all our assets and the assets of our co-borrowers and guarantors under the ABL Facility.\nThe maximum amount that we may borrow under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on restricted cash plus a percentage of the value of certain accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, reduced for certain reserves. We are required to maintain a minimum of $25.0 million of restricted cash at all times, but such amounts are also included in the borrowing base. The ABL Facility matures and any outstanding amounts become due and payable on September 9, 2026. At June 30, 2022, our borrowing base was $80.8 million, we had $15.0 million of outstanding borrowings, and $23.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in availability of $42.5 million under the ABL Facility.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at our option, an annual rate of either a base rate (Base Rate), an Adjusted Term SOFR (\"Adjusted Term SOFR\"), or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is defined as (i) the SOFR plus (ii) 11.448 basis points for a one-month tenor and 26.161 basis points for a three-month tenor; provided that the Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be below zero. The Base Rate is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greater of: (i) rate of interest announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time as its prime rate; (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50%; (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for one month period plus 1.00%; or (iv) 1.00%. Depending on the amount of average availability, the applicable margin is between 1.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, which includes either U.S. or Canadian prime rate, and between 2.00% and 2.50% for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable either (i) monthly for Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate borrowings or (ii) the last day of the interest period for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings, as set forth in the ABL Facility. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum and is due quarterly. The interest rate in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, was 6.00%.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay cash dividends, issue equity instruments, make distribution or redeem or repurchase capital stock. In the event that our availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 15.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. We are in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility as of June 30, 2022.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe ABL Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"), that was entered into on November 2, 2020, and subsequently amended on May 4, 2021, by and among us and certain foreign subsidiaries, as Borrowers, various subsidiaries of ours, as Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and the other Lenders party thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a three-year\nsenior secured revolving credit facility of $200.0 million that expired November 2, 2023. We had no borrowings and $41.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement as of the date we commenced the ABL Facility. Interest expense during the fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees associated with the Prior Credit Agreement.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and the terms of our ABL Facility limit dividends to stock dividends only. Any future dividend payments will depend on the terms of our ABL Facility, our financial condition, capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe may repurchase common stock pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program, which was approved by the board of directors in November 2018. Under the program, the aggregate number of shares repurchased may not exceed 2,707,175 shares. We may repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are not obligated to purchase any shares. The program will continue unless and until it is modified or revoked by the Board of Directors. We made no repurchases under the program in fiscal 2022 and have no current plans to repurchase stock. As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,349,037 shares available for repurchase under the Stock Buyback Program. The terms of our ABL Facility limit share repurchases to $2.5 million per fiscal year provided that we meet certain availability thresholds and do not violate our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nTreasury Shares\nWe had 1,097,703 treasury shares as of June 30, 2022 and intend to utilize these treasury shares in connection with equity awards under the our stock incentive plans and for sales to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2022, our short-term and long-term material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations were as follows:\nOperating Leases: In the normal course of business, we lease real estate and equipment under various arrangements which are classified as operating leases. Future payments for such leases, excluding leases with initial terms of one year or less, were $31.7 million at June 30, 2022, with $7.0 million payable within the next 12 months. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 8 - Leases, for more information about our lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\nOutstanding Debt and Interest Payments: As of June 30, 2022, the amount outstanding under our ABL Facility was $15.0 million. Based on the outstanding balance and interest rates applicable as of June 30, 2022, if we carried the borrowings to the maturity of the facility, we would make total interest payments on the outstanding debt of $6.8 million, with $1.6 million payable within the next 12 months. The outstanding borrowings are due on September 9, 2026 when the ABL Facility matures. Future interest payments will be determined based on prevailing interest rates during that time. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 5 - Debt, for more information about the terms of our ABL Facility.\nDeferred Payroll Taxes: We have deferred $5.6 million of U.S. payroll tax as of June 30, 2022 through provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). We must repay these deferred payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Refer to Part II. Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 - Income Taxes, for more information about the deferred payroll taxes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments\nThe terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies, and provide to our customers, surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts. These surety bonds are issued in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of the bond, and secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts. We have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf. Surety bonds expire at various times ranging from final completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of our bonded operating activity. As of June 30, 2022, there were $140.6 million of surety bonds in force, of which we expect $90.3 million to expire within the next 12 months. We are not aware of any losses in connection with surety bonds that have been posted on our behalf, and we do not expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future.\nWe issue letters of credit under our ABL Facility in the normal course of business to support workers' compensation insurance programs or certain construction contracts. As of June 30, 2022, we had $23.3 million of letters of credit outstanding, nearly all of which expire within the next 12 months. The letters of credit that support our workers compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of our credit facility. The letters of credit that support construction contracts carry expiration dates throughout fiscal 2023.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral Information about our Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue comes from contracts to provide engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction, repair and maintenance and other services. Our engineering, procurement and fabrication and construction services are usually provided in association with capital projects, which are commonly fixed-price contracts that are billed based on project milestones. Our repair and maintenance services typically are cost reimbursable or time and material based contracts and are billed monthly or, for projects of short duration, at the conclusion of the project. The elapsed time from award to completion of performance may exceed one year for capital projects.\nStep 1: Contract Identification\nWe do not recognize revenue unless we have identified a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and obligations of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether a contract should be combined with other contracts and accounted for as a single contract. This evaluation requires judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue and profit recorded for a given period.\nStep 2: Identify Performance Obligations\nNext, we identify each performance obligation in the contract. A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer. Revenue is recognized separately for each performance obligation in the contract. Many of our contracts have one clearly identifiable performance obligation. However, many of our contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more of the following services: engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, repair and maintenance services. For these contracts, we do not consider the integrated services to be distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, we generally identify one performance obligation in our contracts. The determination of the number of performance obligations in a contract requires significant judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue recorded for a given period.\nStep 3: Determine Contract Price\nAfter determining the performance obligations in the contract, we determine the contract price. The contract price is the amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer for completing the performance obligation(s). In a fixed-price contract, the contract price is a single lump-sum amount. In reimbursable and time and materials based contracts, the contract price is determined by the agreed upon rates or reimbursements for time and materials expended in completing the performance obligation(s) in the contract.\nA number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that can either increase or decrease the contract price. These variable consideration amounts are generally earned or incurred based on certain performance metrics, most commonly related to project schedule or cost targets. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount of additional consideration to be received (or paid in the case of penalties), provided that meeting the variable condition is probable. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the contract price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the contract price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We reassess the amount of variable consideration each accounting period until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in the assessed amount of variable consideration are accounted for prospectively as a cumulative adjustment to revenue recognized in the current period.\nStep 4: Assign Contract Price to Performance Obligations\nAfter determining the contract price, we assign such price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. If a contract has multiple performance obligations, we assign the contract price to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices of the distinct services that comprise each performance obligation.\nStep 5: Recognize Revenue as Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nWe record revenue for contracts with our customers as we satisfy the contracts' performance obligations. We recognize revenue on performance obligations associated with fixed-price contracts for engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction services over time since these services create or enhance assets the customer controls as they are being created or enhanced. We measure progress of satisfying these performance obligations by using the percentage-of-completion method, which is based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs at completion, since it best depicts the transfer of control of assets being created or enhanced to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue over time for reimbursable and time and material based repair and maintenance contracts since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of those services as we perform work under the contract. As a practical expedient allowed under the revenue accounting standards, we record revenue for these contracts in the amount to which we have a right to invoice for the services performed provided that we have a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date.\nCosts incurred may include direct labor, direct materials, subcontractor costs and indirect costs, such as salaries and benefits, supplies and tools, equipment costs and insurance costs. Indirect costs are charged to projects based upon direct costs and overhead allocation rates per dollar of direct costs incurred or direct labor hours worked. Typically, customer contracts will include standard warranties that provide assurance that products and services will function as expected. We do not sell separate warranties.\nWe have numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the forecasted costs at completion. Due to the nature of the work left to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total cost at completion for fixed-price contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Estimates of total cost at completion are made each period and changes in these estimates are accounted for prospectively as cumulative adjustments to revenue recognized in the current period. If estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss, a provision is made through a contract write-down for the total loss anticipated.\nChange Orders\nContracts are often modified through change orders, which are changes to the agreed upon scope of work. Most of our change orders, which may be priced or unpriced, are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a change order on the contract price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. For unpriced change orders, we estimate the increase or decrease to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Unpriced change orders are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nClaims\nSometimes we seek claims for amounts in excess of the contract price for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or other causes of additional costs incurred by us. Recognition of amounts as additional contract price related to claims is appropriate only if there is a legal basis for the claim. The determination of our legal basis for a claim requires significant judgment. We estimate the change to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Claims are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenue for unpriced change orders and claims of $8.9 million at June 30, 2022 and $14.6 million at June 30, 2021. The amounts ultimately realized may be significantly different than the recorded amounts resulting in a material adjustment to future earnings. Generally we expect collection of amounts related to unpriced change orders and claims within twelve months. However, customers may not pay these amounts until final resolution of related claims, which may extend beyond one year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is a level below our reportable segments.\nWe perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or in between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, to determine whether an impairment exists and to determine the amount of headroom. We define \"headroom\" as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing managements estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference, but the impairment may not exceed the balance of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, referred to as an income approach, and market multiples, referred to as a market approach, to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. For the income approach, significant judgments and assumptions including forecasted project awards, discount rate, anticipated revenue growth rate, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures are inherent in the fair value estimates, which are based on our operating and capital budgets and on our strategic plan. As a result, actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our income approach. For the market approach, significant judgments and assumptions include the selection of guideline companies, forecasted guideline company EBITDA and our forecasted EBITDA. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges in the financial statements. As a test for reasonableness, we also consider the combined fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2022, which resulted in no impairment. The fiscal 2022 test indicated that four reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 were at higher risk of future impairment. If our view of project opportunities or gross margins deteriorates, particularly for the higher risk reporting units, then we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill.\nWe considered the amount of headroom for each reporting unit when determining whether an impairment existed. The amount of headroom varies by reporting unit. Our significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rate and other factors may change in the future based on the changing economic and competitive environment in which we operate. Assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged, a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom:\nHeadroom Sensitivity Analysis\nGoodwill as of June 30, 2022\n(in thousands) Baseline Headroom Headroom if Revenue Growth Rate\nDeclines by 100 Basis Points Headroom if Gross Margin\nDeclines by 100 Basis Points Headroom if Discount Rate Increases by 100 Basis Points\nReporting Unit 1 $ 12,316 5% -3% -20% -3%\nReporting Unit 2 $ 11,158 4% -2% -12% -4%\nReporting Unit 3 $ 8,287 103% 87% 37% 83%\nReporting Unit 4 $ 6,112 23% 18% 1% 17%\nReporting Unit 5 $ 4,262 16% 9% -17% 6%\nIn the third quarter, we concluded that goodwill impairment indicators existed based on the decline in the price of our stock and operating results that have underperformed our forecasts during the year. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of March 31, 2022 and concluded that there was $18.3 million of total impairment to goodwill, which was recorded as follows:\n$8.4 million in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment;\n$7.2 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment; and\n$2.7 million in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results. We believe that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not. Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances, with the help of professional tax advisors. Therefore, we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities.\nLoss Contingencies\nVarious legal actions, claims and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business. Contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, or are otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies. Specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable. We use a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known. We believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest rate risk results primarily from our variable rate indebtedness under our ABL Facility, which is influenced by movements in short-term rates. Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at our option, an annual rate of either a base rate (Base Rate), an Adjusted Term SOFR (\"Adjusted Term SOFR\"), or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is defined as (i) the SOFR plus (ii) 11.448 basis points for a one-month tenor and 26.161 basis points for a three-month tenor; provided that the Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be below zero. The Base Rate is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greater of: (i) rate of interest announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time as its prime rate; (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50%; (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for one month period plus 1.00%; or (iv) 1.00%. Depending on the amount of average availability, the applicable margin is between 1.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, which includes either U.S. or Canadian prime rate, and between 2.00% and 2.50% for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable either (i) monthly for Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate borrowings or (ii) the last day of the interest period for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings, as set forth in the ABL Facility. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum and is due quarterly. The interest rate in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, was 6.00%.\nFinancial instruments with interest rate risk at June 30, 2022 were as follows:\nMaturity by Fiscal Year\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Fair Value as of June 30, 2022\n(in thousands)\nLong-term debt:\nVariable rate debt $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 15,000 $ 15,000\nIf the interest in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, increases 1.00%, then our interest expense would only increase $0.2 million, which would not have a material impact to our business.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe have subsidiaries with operations in Canada and South Korea, which use the Canadian Dollar and South Korean Won, respectively, as their functional currencies. We also have a subsidiary with operations in Australia, but its functional currency is the U.S. Dollar since its sales are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nHistorically, movements in the Canadian Dollar to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have not significantly impacted our results. Also, we do not expect exchange rate fluctuations in our South Korean and Australian operations to materially impact our financial results since these operations represent an insignificant portion of our consolidated revenue and expenses. However, further growth in our Canadian, South Korean and/or Australian operations and/or significant fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar, South Korean Won and/or Australian Dollar to U.S. Dollar exchange rates could impact our financial results in the future.\nManagement has not entered into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk, but periodically evaluates the materiality of our foreign currency exposure. To mitigate our risk, on occasion we convert Canadian Dollar balances into U.S. Dollars to settle U.S. Dollar amounts owed by our Canadian operations. A 10% unfavorable change in the Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar would not have had a material impact on our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe have no direct commodity exposure, but we do have exposure to materials derived from certain commodities including steel plate, steel pipe, and copper, which are key materials we use. The COVID-19 Pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in disruptions to global supply chains, which have led to higher prices for some of the materials we need to run our business. We mitigate these risks primarily by procuring materials upon contract execution to ensure that our purchase price approximates the costs included in the project estimate, and also by negotiating contract escalation clauses to cover unexpected costs due to fluctuations in materials costs. We have been proactive with managing our procurement processes to help reduce the impacts of rising materials prices on our business and to help ensure we continue to have the materials we need available. However, rising prices and the potential for materials shortages have interjected additional risk into bidding and executing work profitably. Item 8.

The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute assurance that all objectives will be met. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves diligence and is subject to lapses in judgment and human error. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or management override of controls. Because of these limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.\nManagements assessment included an evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, overall control environment and information systems control environment. Based on this assessment, the Companys management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 was effective.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. Deloitte & Touche LLPs report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting is included herein.\n/s/ John R. Hewitt /s/ Kevin S. Cavanah\nJohn R. Hewitt Kevin S. Cavanah\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOctober 11, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nMatrix Service Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Matrix Service Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated October 11, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nOctober 11, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Matrix Service Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Matrix Service Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022 and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 11, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue - Fixed Price Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company enters into contracts with customers to provide engineering, procurement, and fabrication and construction services, usually provided in association with capital projects, which commonly are fixed price contracts and are billed based on project milestones. Revenue on performance obligations associated with fixed-price contracts is recognized over time since these services create or enhance assets the customer controls as they are being created or enhanced. The Company measures progress of satisfying these performance obligations by using the percentage-of-completion method, which is based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs at completion. Due to the nature of work left to be performed on many of the Companys contracts, the estimation of total cost at completion for fixed price contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, revenue totaled $707.8 million, of which $421.2 million related to fixed-price contracts.\nGiven the significant judgment necessary to estimate total costs at completion for fixed price contracts, auditing these estimates required extensive audit effort due to the volume and complexity of the fixed price contracts and a high degree of auditor judgment when evaluating the results of audit procedures, including the involvement of our capital projects specialists for two selected fixed price contracts.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to estimated total costs at completion for fixed price contracts included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the recognition of revenue for fixed price contracts, including managements controls over estimates of total costs at completion.\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate total costs on fixed price contracts.\nWe evaluated managements ability to accurately estimate contract costs by comparing current gross margin to historical gross margin for certain fixed price contracts open and completed during each quarter.\nWe selected a sample of fixed price contracts and performed the following:\n\u25e6Evaluated gross margin changes over time for each selected contract from bid date to the testing date to evaluate managements historical and current estimates of total costs at completion.\n\u25e6Evaluated managements ability to estimate total costs at completion for each selected contract by performing corroborating inquiries with the Companys project managers and personnel involved with the selected contracts, including inquiries related to the timeline to completion and estimates of future costs to complete the contract.\n\u25e6Selected a sample of estimates of future costs to complete for certain selected fixed price contracts and evaluated managements estimates of total costs at completion by performing one of the following:\n\u25aaComparing managements estimates to documents such as managements work plans, customer purchase orders, third-party invoices from suppliers, and subcontractor agreements.\n\u25aaDeveloping independent estimates of total costs to completion and compared our estimates to managements estimates. Our independent estimates were based on information such as managements work plans, customer purchase orders, third-party invoices from suppliers, subcontractor agreements, and similar historical project experience.\n\u25e6For two selected fixed price contracts, we used our capital projects specialists to assist us in evaluating (1) managements ability to estimate total costs at completion and (2) managements estimates of total costs at completion.\nGoodwill - Certain Reporting Units - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Companys evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of managements estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was derived primarily by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys operating and capital budgets and strategic plan. Significant judgments and assumptions including the revenue growth rate, forecasted gross margins, and discount rate are inherent in the fair value estimates. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from managements estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges in the financial statements. The Company performed goodwill impairment tests as of March 31, 2022 and May 31, 2022, which resulted in $18.3 million of total impairment to goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and no impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, respectively. Four reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 were at higher risk of future impairment than others and their estimated fair values exceed their carrying values by 4% to 23%. The Companys total goodwill was $42.1 million as of June 30, 2022.\nWe identified goodwill for four identified reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair values of these reporting units. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions related to the revenue growth rate, forecasted gross margins, and discount rate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the revenue growth rate, forecasted gross margins, and the discount rate used by management to estimate the fair value of the three identified reporting units included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over managements goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the four identified reporting units, such as controls related to managements selection of the revenue growth rate and discount rate and forecasts of gross margins.\nWe evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast the revenue growth rate and future gross margins by comparing actual results to managements historical forecasts.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of managements revenue growth rate and forecasted gross margins by comparing the forecasts to:\n\u25e6Historical revenue growth and gross margins.\n\u25e6Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, including other forward estimates prepared or used by management for other accounting estimates.\n\u25e6Remaining performance obligations.\n\u25e6Information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies and in industry outlooks.\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) the discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nOctober 11, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.\nMatrix Service Company\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\nRevenue $ 707,780 $ 673,398 $ 1,100,938\nCost of revenue 708,986 640,633 998,762\nGross profit (loss) (1,206) 32,765 102,176\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 67,690 69,756 86,276\nGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment 18,312 -

Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe operate in the United States, Canada, South Korea and Australia. Our reportable segments are Utility and Power Infrastructure, Process and Industrial Facilities, and Storage and Terminal Solutions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe the most significant estimates and judgments are associated with revenue recognition, the recoverability tests that must be periodically performed with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and the estimation of loss contingencies, including liabilities associated with litigation and with the self-insured retentions on our insurance programs. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral Information about our Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue comes from contracts to provide engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction, repair and maintenance and other services. Our engineering, procurement and fabrication and construction services are usually provided in association with capital projects, which are commonly fixed-price contracts that are billed based on project milestones. Our repair and maintenance services typically are cost reimbursable or time and material based contracts and are billed monthly or, for projects of short duration, at the conclusion of the project. The elapsed time from award to completion of performance may exceed one year for capital projects.\nStep 1: Contract Identification\nWe do not recognize revenue unless we have identified a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and obligations of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. We also evaluate whether a contract should be combined with other contracts and accounted for as a single contract. This evaluation requires judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue and profit recorded for a given period.\nStep 2: Identify Performance Obligations\nNext, we identify each performance obligation in the contract. A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services to the customer. Revenue is recognized separately for each performance obligation in the contract. Many of our contracts have one clearly identifiable performance obligation. However, many of our contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more of the following services: engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction, repair and maintenance services. For these contracts, we do not consider the integrated services to be distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, we generally identify one performance obligation in our contracts. The determination of the number of performance obligations in a contract requires significant judgment and could change the timing of the amount of revenue recorded for a given period.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nStep 3: Determine Contract Price\nAfter determining the performance obligations in the contract, we determine the contract price. The contract price is the amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer for completing the performance obligation(s). In a fixed-price contract, the contract price is a single lump-sum amount. In reimbursable and time and materials based contracts, the contract price is determined by the agreed upon rates or reimbursements for time and materials expended in completing the performance obligation(s) in the contract.\nA number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that can either increase or decrease the contract price. These variable consideration amounts are generally earned or incurred based on certain performance metrics, most commonly related to project schedule or cost targets. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount of additional consideration to be received (or paid in the case of penalties), provided that meeting the variable condition is probable. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the contract price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the contract price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. We reassess the amount of variable consideration each accounting period until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Changes in the assessed amount of variable consideration are accounted for prospectively as a cumulative adjustment to revenue recognized in the current period.\nStep 4: Assign Contract Price to Performance Obligations\nAfter determining the contract price, we assign such price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. If a contract has multiple performance obligations, we assign the contract price to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices of the distinct services that comprise each performance obligation.\nStep 5: Recognize Revenue as Performance Obligations are Satisfied\nWe record revenue for contracts with our customers as we satisfy the contracts' performance obligations. We recognize revenue on performance obligations associated with fixed-price contracts for engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction services over time since these services create or enhance assets the customer controls as they are being created or enhanced. We measure progress of satisfying these performance obligations by using the percentage-of-completion method, which is based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs at completion, since it best depicts the transfer of control of assets being created or enhanced to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue over time for reimbursable and time and material based repair and maintenance contracts since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of those services as we perform work under the contract. As a practical expedient allowed under the revenue accounting standards, we record revenue for these contracts in the amount to which we have a right to invoice for the services performed provided that we have a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date.\nCosts incurred may include direct labor, direct materials, subcontractor costs and indirect costs, such as salaries and benefits, supplies and tools, equipment costs and insurance costs. Indirect costs are charged to projects based upon direct costs and overhead allocation rates per dollar of direct costs incurred or direct labor hours worked. Typically, customer contracts will include standard warranties that provide assurance that products and services will function as expected. We do not sell separate warranties.\nWe have numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the forecasted costs at completion. Due to the nature of the work left to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total cost at completion for fixed-price contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Estimates of total cost at completion are made each period and changes in these estimates are accounted for prospectively as cumulative adjustments to revenue recognized in the current period. If estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss, a provision is made through a contract write-down for the total loss anticipated.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nChange Orders\nContracts are often modified through change orders, which are changes to the agreed upon scope of work. Most of our change orders, which may be priced or unpriced, are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration of services provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a change order on the contract price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. For unpriced change orders, we estimate the increase or decrease to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Unpriced change orders are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nClaims\nSometimes we seek claims for amounts in excess of the contract price for delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or other causes of additional costs incurred by us. Recognition of amounts as additional contract price related to claims is appropriate only if there is a legal basis for the claim. The determination of our legal basis for a claim requires significant judgment. We estimate the change to the contract price using the variable consideration method described in the Step 3: Determine Contract Price paragraph above. Claims are more fully discussed in Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nWe include as cash equivalents all investments with original maturities of three months or less which are readily convertible into cash. We have cash on deposit at June 30, 2022 with banks in the United States, Canada, South Korea and Australia in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"CDIC\"), Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"KDIC\") and Financial Claims Scheme (\"FCS\") protection limits, respectively. The United States Dollar equivalent of Canadian, South Korean and Australian deposits totaled $5.7 million as of June 30, 2022.\nThe ABL Facility requires us to maintain a minimum of $25.0 million of restricted cash at all times. Since this cash must be restricted through the maturity date of the ABL Facility, which is beyond one year, we have classified this restricted cash as non-current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 52,371 $ 83,878\nRestricted cash $ 25,000 -\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows $ 77,371 $ 83,878\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are carried on a gross basis, less the allowance for credit losses. We estimate the allowance for credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Our customers consist primarily of major integrated oil companies, independent refiners and marketers, power companies, petrochemical companies, pipeline companies, mining companies, contractors and engineering firms. We are exposed to the risk of individual customer defaults or depressed cycles in our customers industries. To mitigate this risk, many of our contracts require payment as projects progress or advance payment in some circumstances. In addition, in most cases we can place liens against the property, plant or equipment constructed or terminate the contract if a material contract default occurs. Accounts are written off against the allowance for credit losses only after all reasonable collection attempts have been exhausted.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nRetentions\nContract retentions collectable beyond one year are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts payable retentions are generally settled within one year.\nLoss Contingencies\nVarious legal actions, claims and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business. Contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, or are otherwise disclosed, in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies. Specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable. We use a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known. We believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable, and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nInventories\nInventories consist primarily of steel plate and pipe and aluminum coil and extrusions. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method and inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Depreciable lives are as follows: buildings-40 years, construction equipment-3 to 15 years, transportation equipment-3 to 5 years, and office equipment and software-3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.\nLeases\nWe enter into lease arrangements for real estate, construction equipment and information technology equipment in the normal course of business. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the arrangement. An arrangement is determined to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of identified property and equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease right-of-use assets are recognized as the present value of future lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date, plus any lease payments made prior to commencement, and less any lease incentives received. Operating lease liabilities are recognized as the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date. Operating lease expense is recognized based on the undiscounted future lease payments over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense related to short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nDeterminations with respect to lease term (including any renewals and terminations), incremental borrowing rate used to discount lease payments, variable lease expense and future lease payments require the use of judgment based on the facts and circumstances related to each lease. We consider various factors, including economic incentives, intent, past history and business need, to determine the likelihood that a renewal option will be exercised.\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for impairment of long-lived assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets used in operations may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on managements estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and, to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets, recording a loss provision.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFor assets identified to be disposed of in the future, the carrying value of the assets are compared to the estimated fair value less the cost of disposal to determine if an impairment has occurred. Until the assets are disposed of, an estimate of the fair value is redetermined when related events or circumstances change.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is a level below our reportable segments.\nWe perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or in between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, to determine whether an impairment exists and to determine the amount of headroom. We define \"headroom\" as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing managements estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill is impaired to the extent of the difference, but the impairment may not exceed the balance of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, referred to as an income approach, and market multiples, referred to as a market approach, to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. For the income approach, significant judgments and assumptions including forecasted project awards, discount rate, anticipated revenue growth rate, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital needs and capital expenditures are inherent in the fair value estimates, which are based on our operating and capital budgets and on our strategic plan. As a result, actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our income approach. For the market approach, significant judgments and assumptions include the selection of guideline companies, forecasted guideline company EBITDA and our forecasted EBITDA. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges in the financial statements. As a test for reasonableness, we also consider the combined fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization.\nOther Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over their useful lives ranging from 6 years to 15 years. A finite intangible asset is considered impaired when its carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the asset's fair value. The carrying amount is deemed unrecoverable if it is greater than the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair values of the intangible assets are based on present values of expected future cash flows or royalties avoided using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations. However, we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles, coverage limits and self-insured retentions. We establish reserves for claims using a combination of actuarially determined estimates and case-by-case evaluations of the underlying claim data and update our evaluations as further information becomes known. Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our reserve accruals; as a result, changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future. If actual results of claim settlements are different than the amounts estimated, we may be exposed to future gains and losses that could be material.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock options, nonvested deferred share awards and cash-settled restricted share units under our long-term incentive compensation plans. The fair value of these awards is calculated at grant date. The fair value of time-based, nonvested deferred shares and cash-settled restricted share units is the value of our common stock at the grant date. The fair value of market-based nonvested deferred shares is based on several factors, including the probability that the market condition specified in the grant will be achieved, which is calculated using a Monte Carlo model. Cash-settled restricted share units must be settled in cash and are accounted for as liability-type awards and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period at fair\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nvalue until settlement. For all awards, expense is recognized over the requisite service period with forfeitures recorded as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results. Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances, with the help of professional tax advisors. Therefore, we estimate and provide for amounts of additional income taxes that may be assessed by the various taxing authorities.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currencies of our operations in Canada, South Korea and Australia are the Canadian Dollar, South Korean Won and U.S. Dollar, respectively. The functional currency of our Australian operations is the U.S. Dollar since its sales are primarily denominated in that currency. For subsidiaries with operations using a foreign functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end exchange rates and the income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates throughout the year. Translation gains and losses are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Translation gains and losses are reversed from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and are recognized in current period income in the event we dispose of an entity with accumulated translation gains or losses. Transaction gains and losses are reported as a component of Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNote 2 - Revenue\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nWe had $484.2 million of remaining performance obligations yet to be satisfied as of June 30, 2022. We expect to recognize approximately $389.9 million of our remaining performance obligations as revenue within the next twelve months.\nContract Balances\nContract terms with customers include the timing of billing and payment, which usually differs from the timing of revenue recognition. As a result, we carry contract assets and liabilities in our balance sheet. These contract assets and liabilities are calculated on a contract-by-contract basis and reported on a net basis at the end of each period and are classified as current. We present our contract assets in the balance sheet as Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of Billings on Uncompleted Contracts (\"CIE\"). CIE consists of revenue recognized in excess of billings. We present our contract liabilities in the balance sheet as Billings on Uncompleted Contracts in Excess of Costs and Estimated Earnings (\"BIE\"). BIE consists of billings in excess of revenue recognized. The following table provides information about CIE and BIE:\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 Change\n(In thousands)\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts $ 44,752 $ 30,774 $ 13,978\nBillings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings (65,106) (53,832) (11,274)\nNet contract liabilities $ (20,354) $ (23,058) $ 2,704\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe difference between the beginning and ending balances of our CIE and BIE primarily results from the timing of revenue recognized relative to its billings. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 that was included in the prior period BIE balance was $49.2 million. This revenue consists primarily of work performed during the period on contracts with customers that had advance billings.\nProgress billings in accounts receivable at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 included retentions to be collected within one year of $16.1 million and $19.9 million, respectively. Contract retentions collectable beyond one year are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $4.0 million as of June 30, 2022 and $3.1 million as of June 30, 2021.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nRevenue disaggregated by reportable segment is presented in Note 13 - Segment Information. The following series of tables presents revenue disaggregated by geographic area where the work was performed and by contract type:\nGeographic Disaggregation:\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nUnited States $ 640,512 $ 604,739 $ 1,020,083\nCanada 63,045 61,703 70,133\nOther international 4,223 6,956 10,722\nTotal $ 707,780 $ 673,398 $ 1,100,938\nContract Type Disaggregation:\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nFixed-price contracts $ 421,188 $ 444,042 $ 685,559\nTime and materials and other cost reimbursable contracts 286,592 229,356 415,379\nTotal $ 707,780 $ 673,398 $ 1,100,938\nTypically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts since increases in cost to perform the work may not be recoverable. However, these types of contracts typically offer higher profits than time and materials and other cost reimbursable contracts when completed at or below the costs originally estimated. The profitability of time and materials and other cost reimbursable contracts is typically lower than fixed-price contracts and is usually less volatile than fixed-price contracts since the profit component is factored into the rates charged for labor, equipment and materials, or is expressed in the contract as a percentage of the reimbursable costs incurred.\nRevisions in Estimates\nOur results of operations were materially impacted by an increase in the forecasted costs to complete a midstream gas processing project in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment. The project reduced gross profit by $8.7 million during fiscal 2022. The increase in forecasted costs was primarily due to poor performance of a now terminated subcontractor, which required rework, as well as supply chain and escalation issues, in order to meet our client's expectations. We expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nOur results of operations were materially impacted by changes in the forecasted costs to complete two large capital projects in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment. Improved project execution on the first project resulted in an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million during the second half of fiscal 2022. However, increases in the forecasted costs to complete this project during the first half of fiscal 2022 resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $3.6 million during fiscal 2022. The increase in forecasted costs during the first half of the fiscal year was principally due to unexpected equipment repairs during commissioning that delayed the scheduled completion and increased the estimated costs to complete. We achieved a critical performance milestone during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which significantly reduced our financial exposure on the project.\nIncreased forecasted costs to the complete the second project resulted in the project reducing gross profit by $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2022. We recognized $78.1 million of revenue on this project during the year at a near break-even margin as a result of the change in estimate. The increase in forecasted costs was the result of higher than anticipated subcontractor costs and labor costs as the project neared completion. We expect to complete the project during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nOur results of operations were materially impacted by an increase in the costs required to complete a thermal energy storage tank repair and maintenance project in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment, which resulted in a decrease in gross profit of $6.3 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in costs was primarily due to changes in repair scope, expanded client weld testing and associated schedule delays. We achieved substantial completion on this project in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nNote 3-Property, Plant and Equipment\nThe following table presents the components of our property, plant and equipment - net at June 30, 2022 and 2021:\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nProperty, plant and equipment - at cost:\nLand and buildings $ 34,788 $ 41,633\nConstruction equipment 93,036 94,453\nTransportation equipment 48,999 50,510\nOffice equipment and software 43,823 42,706\nConstruction in progress 1,646 493\nTotal property, plant and equipment - at cost 222,292 229,795\nAccumulated depreciation (168,423) (160,388)\nProperty, plant and equipment - net $ 53,869 $ 69,407\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nGeographical Disaggregation of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-Lived Assets\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nUnited States $ 137,682 $ 157,442 $ 164,056\nCanada 3,436 6,523 5,659\nOther international 12,263 12,372 12,435\n$ 153,381 $ 176,337 $ 182,150\nSale-leaseback Transaction\nWe sold our regional office and fabrication and warehouse facilities located in Orange, California during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for net proceeds of $37.4 million in cash. We recorded a gain of $32.4 million on the sale, which is included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In connection with the sale, we also entered into a leaseback agreement for a period up to 24 months while we locate replacement facilities. We are still fully committed to our operations in Southern California - we decided to enter into the sale and leaseback transaction to take advantage of the elevated real estate market valuations in Southern California.\nNote 4-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:\nUtility and Power\nInfrastructure Process and Industrial Facilities Storage and Terminal\nSolutions Total\n(In thousands)\nNet balance at June 30, 2019 $ 31,840 $ 34,842 $ 26,686 $ 93,368\nGoodwill impairment (24,900) (7,981) - (32,881)\nTranslation adjustment (1)\n(35) (15) (68) (118)\nNet balance at June 30, 2020 6,905 26,846 26,618 60,369\nTranslation adjustment (1)\n79 32 156 267\nNet balance at June 30, 2021 6,984 26,878 26,774 60,636\nGoodwill impairment (2,659) (8,445) (7,208) (18,312)\nTranslation adjustment(1)\n(62) (6) (121) (189)\nNet balance at June 30, 2022 $ 4,263 $ 18,427 $ 19,445 $ 42,135\n(1)The translation adjustments relate to the periodic translation of Canadian Dollar and South Korean Won denominated goodwill recorded as a part of prior acquisitions in Canada and South Korea, in which the local currency was determined to be the functional currency.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2022, which resulted in no impairment. The fiscal 2022 test indicated that four reporting units with a combined total of $33.8 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2022 were at higher risk of future impairment. If our view of project opportunities or gross margins deteriorates, particularly for the higher risk reporting units, then we may be required to record an impairment of goodwill.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we concluded that goodwill impairment indicators existed based on the decline in the price of our stock and operating results that have underperformed our forecasts during the year. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of March 31, 2022 and concluded that there was $18.3 million of total impairment to goodwill, which was recorded as follows:\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n$8.4 million in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment;\n$7.2 million in the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment; and\n$2.7 million in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we concluded that a goodwill impairment indicator existed in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment based on the recent history of depressed gross margins and the second quarters downward acceleration of revenue and gross margin. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of December 31, 2019, reflecting updated revenue and gross margin assumptions, and concluded that the reporting unit's $24.9 million of goodwill was fully impaired. Additionally, we concluded that a goodwill impairment indicator existed for a Process and Industrial Facilities segment reporting unit based on several second quarter events. These events included the deterioration of our relationship with a significant customer in the iron and steel industry in the second quarter. As a result, the customer canceled other previously awarded work and we received no subsequent business from this customer. Accordingly, we performed an interim impairment test as of December 31, 2019 and concluded that the reporting unit's $8.0 million of goodwill was fully impaired.\nThe estimated fair value of each segment was derived by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples of projected EBITDA. The key assumptions used are described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies, Goodwill.\nOther Intangible Assets\nInformation on the carrying value of other intangible assets is as follows:\nAt June 30, 2022\nUseful Life Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying\nAmount\n(Years) (In thousands)\nIntellectual property 10 to 15 $ 2,558 $ (2,276) $ 282\nCustomer based 6 to 15 17,331 (12,817) 4,514\nTotal other intangible assets $ 19,889 $ (15,093) $ 4,796\nAt June 30, 2021\nUseful Life Gross\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net Carrying\nAmount\n(Years) (In thousands)\nIntellectual property 10 to 15 $ 2,483 $ (2,031) $ 452\nCustomer based 6 to 15 17,354 (11,192) 6,162\nTotal other intangible assets $ 19,837 $ (13,223) $ 6,614\nAmortization expense totaled $1.8 million, $2.3 million, and $3.4 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we fully impaired a customer relationship intangible asset with a net book value of $1.2 million. The customer relationship primarily related to services in the Utility and Power Infrastructure segment which were impacted by our performance improvement plan (see Note 14 - Restructuring Costs). As a result, the customer relationship intangible asset was no longer recoverable. As of June 30, 2020, this intangible asset had a remaining useful life of approximately 2 years, a gross carrying amount of $6.3 million and accumulated amortization of $5.1 million. The impairment is included in restructuring costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAlso in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we fully impaired a customer relationship intangible asset with a net book value of $0.4 million in connection with the closure of an underperforming operating unit in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment. The closure was part of our performance improvement plan (see Note 14 - Restructuring Costs). As of June 30, 2020, this intangible asset had a remaining useful life of approximately 4 years, a gross carrying amount of $0.9 million and accumulated amortization of $0.5 million. The impairment is included in the restructuring costs caption in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the factors disclosed for the Process and Industrial Facilities segment goodwill impairment above, we fully impaired a customer relationship with a net book value of $5.6 million. As of December 31, 2019, this intangible asset had a remaining useful life of 9 years, a gross carrying amount of $9.4 million and accumulated amortization of $3.8 million. The impairment is included within the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment caption in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe estimate that future amortization of other intangible assets will be as follows (in thousands):\nFor year ending:\nJune 30, 2023 $ 1,729\nJune 30, 2024 1,416\nJune 30, 2025 1,096\nJune 30, 2026 555\nTotal estimated amortization expense $ 4,796\nNote 5-Debt\nABL Credit Facility\nOn October 5, 2022, we and our primary U.S. and Canada operating subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment and Waiver to Credit Agreement (the Amendment), which amended our asset-backed credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\"), dated as of September 9, 2021 with Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and a Letter of Credit Issuer, and the lenders named therein. The Amendment (i) waives an event of default resulting from our failure to deliver the Administrative Agent and the lenders our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 by September 28, 2022 (the Audited Financial Statements), provided we deliver the Audited Financial Statements by October 14, 2022, (ii) reduces the maximum amount of loans under the ABL Facility to $90.0 million from $100.0 million and (iii) replaces the London interbank offered rate with the forward term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (the SOFR) as the interest rate benchmark.\nThe ABL Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our remaining U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. The ABL Facility available borrowings may be increased by an amount not to exceed $15.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments. The ABL Facility is intended to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, issuances of letters of credit and other lawful purposes. Our obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a first lien on all our assets and the assets of our co-borrowers and guarantors under the ABL Facility.\nThe maximum amount that we may borrow under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on restricted cash plus a percentage of the value of certain accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, reduced for certain reserves. We are required to maintain a minimum of $25.0 million of restricted cash at all times, but such amounts are also included in the borrowing base. The ABL Facility matures and any outstanding amounts become due and payable on September 9, 2026. At June 30, 2022, our borrowing base was $80.8 million, we had $15.0 million of outstanding borrowings, and $23.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, which resulted in availability of $42.5 million under the ABL Facility.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at our option, an annual rate of either a base rate (Base Rate), an Adjusted Term SOFR (\"Adjusted Term SOFR\"), or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin. The Adjusted Term SOFR is defined as (i) the SOFR plus (ii) 11.448 basis points for a one-month tenor and 26.161 basis points for a three-month tenor; provided that the Adjusted Term SOFR cannot be below zero. The Base Rate is defined as a fluctuating interest rate equal to the greater of: (i) rate of interest announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time as its prime rate; (ii) the U.S. federal funds rate plus 0.50%; (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR for one month period plus 1.00%; or (iv) 1.00%. Depending on the amount of average availability, the applicable margin is between 1.00% to 1.50% for Base Rate and Canadian Prime Rate borrowings, which includes either U.S. or Canadian prime rate, and between 2.00% and 2.50% for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. Interest is payable either (i) monthly for Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate borrowings or (ii) the last day of the interest period for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings, as set forth in the ABL Facility. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum and is due quarterly. The interest rate in effect for borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2022, including applicable margin, was 6.00%.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness and guarantees, create or permit to exist liens, pay cash dividends, issue equity instruments, make distribution or redeem or repurchase capital stock. In the event that our availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 15.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. We are in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility as of June 30, 2022.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe ABL Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"), that was entered into on November 2, 2020, and subsequently amended on May 4, 2021, by and among us and certain foreign subsidiaries, as Borrowers, various subsidiaries of ours, as Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and the other Lenders party thereto. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a three-year senior secured revolving credit facility of $200.0 million that expired November 2, 2023. We had no borrowings and $41.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2021. Interest expense during fiscal 2022 included $1.5 million of accelerated amortization of deferred debt amendment fees associated with the Prior Credit Agreement.\nNote 6-Income Taxes\nSources of Pretax Income (Loss)\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nDomestic $ (53,258) $ (38,867) $ (32,660)\nForeign (5,025) (4,396) (3,984)\nTotal $ (58,283) $ (43,263) $ (36,644)\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nComponents of the Provision for Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 230 $ (13,154) $ (376)\nState 28 465 412\nForeign 1 (239) 23\n259 (12,928) 59\nDeferred:\nFederal 2,504 774 (5,000)\nState 2,858 (291) (1,091)\nForeign (4) 406 2,462\n5,358 889 (3,629)\n$ 5,617 $ (12,039) $ (3,570)\nReconciliation Between the Expected Income Tax Provision Applying the Domestic Federal Statutory Tax Rate and the Reported Income Tax Provision\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nExpected benefit for federal income taxes at the statutory rate $ (12,239) $ (9,085) $ (7,695)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (1,971) (1,240) (768)\nImpairment of non-deductible goodwill(1)\n1,132 - 1,813\nCharges without tax benefit 265 961 1,707\nChange in valuation allowance(2)\n17,943 2,797 3,062\nExcess tax expense (benefit) on stock-based compensation 1,019 1,826 230\nResearch and development and other tax credits (613) (1,707) (1,724)\nForeign tax differential (232) (96) (132)\nFederal rate differential net operating loss carryback(3)\n141 (5,223) -\nChange in uncertain tax positions (120) (7) 20\nOther 292 (265) (83)\nProvision (benefit) for federal, state and foreign income taxes $ 5,617 $ (12,039) $ (3,570)\n(1)In fiscal 2022, we impaired $18.3 million of goodwill, which included $5.4 million of non-deductible goodwill. In fiscal 2020, we impaired $32.9 million of goodwill, which included $8.6 million of non-deductible goodwill. See Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information about the impairments.\n(2)In fiscal 2022, due to the existence of a cumulative loss over a three-year period, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $17.9 million against our deferred tax assets. These assets are primarily comprised of federal net operating losses, which have an indefinite carryforward, federal tax credits and state net operating losses. To the extent we generate taxable income in the future, or cumulative losses are no longer present and our future projections for growth or tax planning strategies are demonstrated, we will realize the benefit associated with the net operating losses for which the valuation allowance has been provided. In fiscal 2021, we placed $2.8 million of valuation allowances, including $1.5 million on certain state net operating loss carryforwards due to a recent history of cumulative losses for a subsidiary. In fiscal 2020, we placed $3.1 million of valuation allowances on net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits primarily related to Canada.\n(3)Relates to fiscal 2021 net operating losses carried back under provisions of the CARES Act to fiscal years 2016 and 2017 which had a 35% federal tax rate.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSignificant Components of our Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nWarranty reserve $ 206 $ 206\nBad debt reserve 340 231\nPaid-time-off accrual 315 747\nInsurance reserve 1,019 1,229\nLegal reserve 79 146\nNet operating loss benefit and credit carryforwards 23,717 14,966\nAccrued compensation and pension 736 690\nPrepaid insurance 16 27\nStock compensation expense on nonvested deferred shares 1,910 1,895\nAccrued losses 1,089 64\nRestructuring reserve 160 725\nBook over tax amortization 5,449 3,765\nDeferred FICA 1,427 1,920\nForeign currency translation and other 1,002 665\nValuation allowance (28,615) (11,104)\nTotal deferred tax assets 8,850 16,172\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nTax over book depreciation 7,842 10,315\nReceivable holdbacks and other 1,034 596\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 8,876 10,911\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $ (26) $ 5,261\nAs reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n(In thousands)\nDeferred income tax assets - 5,295\nDeferred income tax liabilities (26) (34)\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) (26) $ 5,261\nValuation Allowance\nIn fiscal 2022, due to the existence of a cumulative loss over a three-year period, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $17.9 million against our deferred tax assets. These assets are primarily comprised of federal net operating losses, which have an indefinite carryforward, federal tax credits and state net operating losses. To the extent we generate taxable income in the future, or cumulative losses are no longer present and our future projections for growth or tax planning strategies are demonstrated, we will realize the benefit associated with the net operating losses for which the valuation allowance has been provided.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nOperating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowance at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 reduces the recognized tax benefit of these carryforwards to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The gross carryforwards will generally expire as shown below for each jurisdiction:\nOperating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards Expiration Period Amount (in thousands)\nFederal net operating loss Indefinite $ 27,207\nFederal tax credits June 2041 to June 2042 $ 1,700\nFederal foreign tax credits June 2023 to June 2025 $ 655\nState net operating losses June 2025 to indefinite $ 73,889\nState tax credits June 2033 to indefinite $ 912\nForeign net operating losses June 2029 to June 2042 $ 37,379\nForeign tax credits June 2035 to June 2042 $ 676\nNet Operating Loss Carryback Refund\nThrough provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (the \"CARES Act\"), we had an income tax benefit from the ability to carryback the fiscal 2021 federal net operating loss to a period with a higher statutory federal income tax rate. We estimate that we will receive a $12.6 million tax refund in connection with this carryback, which is included in income taxes receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRefund of Overpayment of Estimated Taxes\nIn January 2022, we received a $2.4 million tax refund in connection with overpayments of estimated taxes from prior years.\nDeferred Payroll Taxes\nAs of June 30, 2022, we have a balance of $5.6 million remaining on U.S. payroll taxes we deferred through provisions of the CARES Act. We paid half of the original deferred payroll tax balance during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and must repay the remaining balance by December 31, 2022. The remaining balance of deferred payroll taxes is included within accrued wages and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\nIn general, it is our practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in our foreign operations. We do not provide for outside basis differences under the indefinite reinvestment assertion of ASC 740-30.\nWe file tax returns in multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities through fiscal 2017. At June 30, 2022, we updated our evaluation of our open tax years in all known jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2022, we have a $0.3 million liability for unrecognized tax positions and the payment of related interest and penalties. We treat the related interest and penalties as income tax expense. Due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\nNote 7-Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance Reserves\nWe maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations. However, exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nTypically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects. We maintain a performance and payment bonding line sufficient to support the business. We generally require our subcontractors to indemnify us and our customer and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure the subcontractors work or as required by the subcontract.\nThere can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers.\nUnpriced Change Orders and Claims\nAs of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenue for unpriced change orders and claims of $8.9 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The amounts ultimately realized may be significantly different than the recorded amounts resulting in a material adjustment to future earnings. Generally we expect collection of amounts related to unpriced change orders and claims within twelve months. However, customers may not pay these amounts until final resolution of related claims, which may extend beyond one year.\nOther\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we commenced litigation in an effort to collect accounts receivable from an iron and steel customer following the deterioration of the relationship in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The unpaid receivable balance at June 30, 2022 was $17.0 million. Litigation is unpredictable, however, based on the terms of the contract with this customer, we believe we are entitled to collect the full amount owed under the contract.\nWe and our subsidiaries are participants in various legal actions. It is the opinion of management that none of the other known legal actions will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nNote 8- Leases\nWe enter into lease arrangements for real estate, construction equipment and information technology equipment in the normal course of business. Real estate leases accounted for approximately 96% of all right-of-use assets as of June 30, 2022. Most real estate and information technology equipment leases generally have fixed payments that follow an agreed upon payment schedule and have remaining lease terms ranging from less than a year to 14 years. Construction equipment leases generally have \"month-to-month\" lease terms that automatically renew as long as the equipment remains in use.\nIn fiscal 2021 we recorded $0.5 million of impairments to right-of-use assets related to leased office space that was closed in connection with our restructuring activities, see Note 14 - Restructuring Costs for additional information.\nThe components of lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nLease expense Location of Expense in Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands)\nOperating lease expense Cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7,511 $ 8,386 $ 12,274\nShort-term lease expense(1)\nCost of revenue 24,225 25,912 37,371\nTotal lease expense $ 31,736 $ 34,298 $ 49,645\n(1)Primarily represents the lease expense of construction equipment that is subject to month-to-month rental agreements with expected rental durations of less than one year.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe future undiscounted lease payments, as reconciled to the discounted operating lease liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, were as follows:\nJune 30, 2022\nMaturity Analysis: (in thousands)\nFiscal 2023 $ 6,956\nFiscal 2024 5,654\nFiscal 2025 3,697\nFiscal 2026 3,400\nFiscal 2027 3,288\nThereafter 8,681\nTotal future operating lease payments 31,676\nImputed interest (6,057)\nNet present value of future lease payments 25,619\nLess: current portion of operating lease liabilities 5,715\nNon-current operating lease liabilities $ 19,904\nThe following is a summary of the weighted average remaining operating lease term and weighted average discount rate as of June 30, 2022:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 7.2 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.0 %\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2022\n(in thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating lease payments $ 8,060\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities:\nOperating leases $ 5,687\nNote 9-Stockholders Equity\nPreferred Stock\nWe have 5.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized, none of which was issued or outstanding at June 30, 2022 or June 30, 2021.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe may repurchase common stock pursuant to the Stock Buyback Program, which was approved by the board of directors in November 2018. Under the program, the aggregate number of shares repurchased may not exceed 2,707,175 shares. We may repurchase our stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions and are not obligated to purchase any shares. The program will continue unless and until it is modified or revoked by the Board of Directors. We made no repurchases under the program in fiscal 2022 and have no current plans to repurchase stock. The terms\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nof our ABL Facility limit share repurchases to $2.5 million per fiscal year provided that we meet certain availability thresholds and do not violate our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant. There were 1,349,037 shares available for repurchase under the November 2018 Program as of June 30, 2022.\nTreasury Shares\nIn addition to the stock buyback program, we may withhold shares of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligations upon vesting of an employees deferred shares. We withheld 76,703, 170,629, and 181,081 shares of common stock during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, to satisfy these obligations. These shares were returned to our pool of treasury shares. We have 1,097,703 treasury shares as of June 30, 2022 and intend to utilize these treasury shares in connection with equity awards under our incentive plans and for sales to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nNote 10-Stock-Based Compensation\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020 was $7.9 million, $8.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Measured but unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at June 30, 2022 was $9.0 million, all of which related to nonvested deferred shares which are expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. We recognized excess tax expense of $1.0 million, $1.8 million, and $0.2 million related to stock-based compensation vesting for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nPlan Information\nIn November 2020, our stockholders approved the Matrix Service Company 2020 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the \"2020 Plan\"), which provides stock-based and cash-based incentives for officers, directors and other key employees. Stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and cash-based awards can be issued under this plan. Upon approval of the 2020 Plan, the 2018 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (\"2018 Plan\") was frozen with the exception of normal vesting and other activity associated with awards previously granted under the 2018 Plan. The 2018 Plan was preceded by the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (\"2016 Plan\"), which was frozen upon approval of the 2018 Plan with the exception of normal vesting, forfeiture and other activity associated with awards previously granted under the 2016 Plan. Shares awarded under either the 2018 Plan or 2016 Plan that are subsequently forfeited or net settled for tax withholding purposes are returned to the treasury share pool and become available for grant under the 2020 Plan.\nAwards totaling 1,725,000 shares have been authorized under the 2020 Plan. There were 1,392,706 shares available for grant under the 2020 Plan as of June 30, 2022.\nStock Options\nWe did not award any new stock options in fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020. The 19,550 options outstanding as of June 30, 2021 were exercised in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 at a weighted average exercise price of $10.19 per share. There were no options outstanding at June 30, 2022. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised were less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2022 and $0.1 million during fiscal 2021. No stock options were exercised in fiscal 2020.\nNonvested Deferred Shares\nWe have issued nonvested deferred shares under the following types of arrangements:\nTime-based awards-Employee awards generally vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the award agreements contain a provision that accelerates the vesting for retirement eligible participants and participants that become retirement eligible during the vesting period and who elect to retire more than one year after the date of the award. The award is forfeited if retirement occurs before the first anniversary of the award. Settlement still occurs on the normal vesting schedules. Director awards vest one year after the grant date.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nMarket-based awards-These awards are in the form of performance units which vest 3 years after the grant date only if our common stock achieves certain levels of total shareholder return when compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies as selected by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The payout can range from zero to 200% of the original award depending on the Company's relative total shareholder return during the performance period. These awards are settled in stock. As of June 30, 2022, there were approximately 163,000, 340,000, and 389,000 performance units that are scheduled to vest in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2025, respectively, assuming target performance.\nAll awards under the 2020 Plan vest upon the death or disability of the participant or upon a change of control of the Company, provided that the successor company fails to assume or replace the awards in connection with that change of control event. If the successor company does assume the awards, then vesting of the awards will be accelerated in the event of an involuntary termination or other material adverse event that occurs in connection with or following the change of control. All awards prior to the 2020 Plan vest upon the death or disability of the participant or upon a change of control of the Company.\nThe grant date fair value of the time-based awards is determined by the market value of our common stock on the grant date. The grant date fair value of the market-based awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo model. For the fiscal 2022 grant, the model estimated the fair value of the award based on approximately 100,000 simulations of the future prices of our common stock compared to the future prices of the common stock of its peer companies based on historical volatilities. The model also took into account the expected dividends over the performance period of those peer companies which pay cash dividends.\nNonvested deferred share activity for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 is as follows:\nShares Weighted Average Grant\nDate Fair Value per\nShare\nNonvested shares at June 30, 2021 1,280,707 $ 17.07\nShares granted 696,227 $ 14.13\nShares vested and released (268,403) $ 13.92\nShares canceled (242,743) $ 25.50\nNonvested shares at June 30, 2022 1,465,788 $ 14.86\nThere were 665,597 and 490,322 deferred shares granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020 with average grant date fair values of $10.60 and $21.79 per share, respectively. There were 515,218 and 542,279 deferred shares that vested and were released in fiscal 2021 and 2020 with weighted average fair values of $16.99 and $19.43 per share, respectively. There were 119,904 deferred shares cancelled in fiscal 2021 with an average grant date fair value of $20.67. No deferred shares were cancelled in fiscal 2020.\nCash-Settled Restricted Share Units\nWe granted 231,219 and 238,848 cash-settled restricted share units during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively; with weighted average fair values of $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively. No cash-settled restricted share units were granted in fiscal year 2020. There were 53,333 shares vested and released in fiscal 2022 with a weighted average fair value of $0.5 million. There were no cash-settled restricted shares vested or released in fiscal 2021 or 2020. There were 25,355 shares cancelled in fiscal 2022 with a weighted average fair value of $0.3 million. There were no cash-settled restricted shares cancelled in fiscal 2021 or 2020.\nThe grant date fair value of these awards is based on the price of our common stock and the number of shares awarded on the date of grant. The award must be settled in cash and is accounted for as a liability-type award. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period with remeasurement at the end of each reporting period at fair value until settlement. The requisite service period is based on the vesting provisions of the awards which generally occur in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date. These awards contain the same retirement provisions described for time-based awards in the nonvested deferred shares section above.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nWe recognized $0.6 million and $1.0 million of expense in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, for cash-settled restricted share units, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of June 30, 2022, the liability for cash-settled restricted share units was $0.9 million and is included in accrued wages and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 11-Earnings per Common Share\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of employee and director stock options and nonvested deferred shares. Stock options are considered dilutive whenever the exercise price is less than the average market price of the stock during the period and antidilutive whenever the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common stock during the period. Nonvested deferred shares are considered dilutive (antidilutive) whenever the average market value of the shares during the period exceeds (is less than) the sum of the related average unamortized compensation expense during the period plus the related hypothetical estimated excess tax benefit that will be realized when the shares vest. Stock options and nonvested deferred shares are considered antidilutive in the event we report a net loss.\nThe computation of basic and diluted EPS is as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 June 30,\n2021 June 30,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nBasic EPS:\nNet loss $ (63,900) $ (31,224) $ (33,074)\nWeighted average shares outstanding 26,733 26,451 26,621\nBasic loss per share $ (2.39) $ (1.18) $ (1.24)\nDiluted EPS:\nWeighted average shares outstanding-basic 26,733 26,451 26,621\nDiluted weighted average shares 26,733 26,451 26,621\nDiluted loss per share $ (2.39) $ (1.18) $ (1.24)\nNote 12-Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor defined contribution savings plans for all eligible employees meeting length of service requirements. Under the primary plan, participants may contribute an amount up to 25% of pretax annual compensation subject to certain limitations. We match 100% of the first 3% of employee contributions and 50% of the next 2% of employee contributions. Our matching contributions vest immediately.\nOur matching contributions were $5.3 million, $5.4 million, and $6.2 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and Canada under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees, who are represented by more than 100 local unions. The related collective-bargaining agreements between those organizations and us, which specify the rate at which we must contribute to the multi-employer defined pension plan, expire at different times between 2022 and 2025. Benefits under these plans are generally based on compensation levels and years of service.\nFor us, the financial risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following respects:\nAssets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\nIf a participating employer discontinues contributions to a plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\nIf a participating employer chooses to stop participating in a plan, a withdrawal liability may be created based on the unfunded vested benefits for all employees in the plan.\nUnder federal legislation regarding multiemployer pension plans, in the event of a withdrawal from a plan or plan termination, companies are required to continue funding their proportionate share of such plans unfunded vested benefits. We are a participant in multiple union sponsored multiemployer plans, and, as a plan participant, our potential obligation could be significant. The amount of the potential obligation is not currently ascertainable because the information required to determine such amount is not identifiable or readily available.\nOur participation in significant plans for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 is outlined in the table below. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three digit plan number. The zone status is based on the latest information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plans actuary. Plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are generally less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are generally at least 80 percent funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. The Surcharge Imposed column includes plans in a red zone status that require a payment of a surcharge in excess of regular contributions. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nPension Fund EIN/Pension\nPlan Number Pension\nProtection Act\nZone Status FIP/RP\nStatus\nPending or\nImplemented Company Contributions\nFiscal Year Surcharge\nImposed\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2020\n(In thousands)\nBoilermaker-Blacksmith National Pension Trust 48-6168020/001 Yellow Yellow Implemented $ 5,208 $ 4,003 $ 6,634 No\nNational Electrical Benefit Fund, IBEW locals 71, 126, 488, and 1319 53-0181657/001 Described below (1)\nGreen NA 2,973 1,865 2,674 No\nJoint Pension Fund Local Union 164 IBEW 22-6031199/001 Described below (1)\nDescribed below (1)\nImplemented 1,514 1,958 1,560 No\nJoint Pension Fund of Local Union No 102 IBEW 22-1615726/001 Described below (1)\nGreen NA 906 1,341 1,227 No\nIBEW Local 456 Pension Plan 22-6238995/001 Green Green NA 734 595 427 No\nLocal 351 IBEW Pension Plan\n22-3417366/001 Green Green NA 395 479 1,709 No\nSteamfitters Local Union No 420 Pension Plan 23-2004424/001 Described below (1)\nRed Implemented 498 442 1,523 Yes\nIBEW Local 654 Pension Plan 23-6538183/001 Green Green NA 857 818 1,021 No\nOhio Carpenters' Pension Fund, Locals 1090 and 351 34-6574360/001 Described below (1)\nRed Implemented - - 3,042 Yes\nIron Workers Pension Plan, Local 55 34-6682351/001 Described below (1)\nGreen NA - - 2,951 No\nNorthwestern Ohio Plumbers and Pipefitters Pension, Local 50 34-6502487/001 Described below (1)\nGreen NA - - 2,504 No\nIndiana Laborers Pension Fund 35-6027150/001 Described below (1)\nGreen NA - 20 1,604 No\nIron Workers Mid-America Pension Plan, Local 395 36-6488227/001 Green Green NA - - 840 No\nPipefitters Retirement Fund, Local 597 62-6105084/001 Described below (1)\nGreen NA 4 - 835 No\nIron Workers Pension Plan of Western Pennsylvania, Local 3 25-1283169/001 Green Green NA - - 500 No\nContributions to other multiemployer plans 3,729 3,848 8,352\nTotal contributions made $ 16,818 $ 15,369 $ 37,403\n(1)For the National Electrical Benefit Fund for Locals 71/126/488/1319, Local 164 IBEW Pension Plan, Local IBEW 102 IBEW Pension Plan, Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Pension Plan, Locals 1090 and 351 of the Ohio Carpenters' Pension Fund, Iron Workers Pension Plan Local 55, Northwestern Ohio Plumbers and Pipefitters Pension Local 50, Indiana Laborers Pension Fund, and Pipefitters Retirement Fund Local 597, we have not received a funding notification that covers our fiscal year 2022 during the preparation of this Form 10-K. For Local 164 IBEW Pension Plan, we have not received a funding notification that covers our fiscal year 2021 either. Under Federal pension law, if a multiemployer pension plan is determined to be in critical or endangered status, the plan must provide notice of this status to participants, beneficiaries, the bargaining parties, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Department of Labor. We also observed that these plans have not submitted any Critical or Endangered Status Notices to the Department of Labor for calendar years that we have not received notification. The Critical or Endangered Status Notices can be accessed at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/public-disclosure/2022-funding-status-notices#2020-c-and-d.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Matrix Service Company 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) was effective January 1, 2011. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares through payroll deductions and members of the Board of Directors to purchase shares from amounts withheld from their cash retainers. Share purchases are limited to an aggregate market value of no greater than $60,000 per calendar year per participant and are purchased from us at the current market value with no discount to the participant. Contributions are with after tax earnings and are accumulated in non-interest bearing accounts for quarterly purchases of company stock. Upon the purchase of shares, the participants receive all stockholder rights including dividend and voting rights and are permitted to sell their shares at any time. We have made 1,000,000 shares available under the ESPP. The ESPP can be terminated at any time at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will automatically terminate once the plan shares are exhausted. Shares are issued from Treasury Stock under the ESPP. There were 29,826 shares issued in fiscal 2022, 29,171 shares in fiscal 2021, and 20,733 shares in fiscal 2020.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNote 13-Segment Information\nIn fiscal 2022, we operated our business through three reportable segments:\nUtility and Power Infrastructure: consists of power delivery services provided to investor-owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, transmission and distribution line installations, upgrades and maintenance, as well as emergency and storm restoration services. We also provide engineering, fabrication, and construction services for LNG utility peak shaving facilities, and construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, including natural gas fired facilities, in simple or combined cycle configuration.\nProcess and Industrial Facilities: primarily serves customers in the downstream and midstream petroleum industries who are engaged in refining crude oil and processing, fractionating, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. We also serve customers in various other industries such as petrochemical, sulfur, mining and minerals companies engaged primarily in the extraction of non-ferrous metals, aerospace and defense, cement, agriculture, and other industrial customers. Our services include plant maintenance, turnarounds, industrial cleaning services, engineering, fabrication, and capital construction.\nStorage and Terminal Solutions: consists of work related to aboveground storage tanks and terminals. We also include work related to cryogenic and other specialty storage tanks and terminals, including LNG, liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen, liquid petroleum, hydrogen and other specialty vessels such as spheres in this segment, as well work related to marine structures and truck and rail loading/offloading facilities. Our services include engineering, fabrication, construction, and maintenance and repair, which includes planned and emergency services for both tanks and full terminals. Finally, we offer tank products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.\nWe evaluate performance and allocate resources based on operating income. We eliminate intersegment sales; therefore, no intercompany profit or loss is recognized. Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses are excluded from our three reportable segments in order to better align controllable costs with the responsibility of segment management, and to be consistent with how our chief operating decision-maker assesses segment performance and allocates resources.\nSegment assets consist primarily of accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use lease assets, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nResults of Operations\n(In thousands)\nUtility and Power Infrastructure Process and Industrial Facilities Storage and Terminal\nSolutions Corporate Total\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2022\nGross revenue $ 220,093 $ 258,497 $ 236,260 $ - $ 714,850\nLess: inter-segment revenue - 3,649 3,421 - 7,070\nConsolidated revenue 220,093 254,848 232,839 - 707,780\nGross profit (loss) (8,586) 9,270 262 (2,152) (1,206)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 11,771 12,506 17,284 26,129 67,690\nGoodwill impairment and restructuring costs 2,746 6,867 7,330 2,015 18,958\nOperating loss (23,103) (10,103) (24,352) (30,296) (87,854)\nSegment assets 94,059 104,078 141,084 101,572 440,793\nCapital expenditures 29 254 338 2,724 3,345\nDepreciation and amortization 3,812 5,659 5,540 243 15,254\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2021\nGross revenue $ 210,052 $ 201,472 $ 267,982 $ - $ 679,506\nLess: inter-segment revenue - 1,555 4,553 - 6,108\nConsolidated revenue 210,052 199,917 263,429 - 673,398\nGross profit 1,506 17,642 13,617 - 32,765\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 9,882 14,756 18,644 26,474 69,756\nRestructuring costs 1,312 3,807 1,391 246 6,756\nOperating loss (9,688) (921) (6,418) (26,720) (43,747)\nSegment assets 81,717 106,619 160,782 118,438 467,556\nCapital expenditures 1,183 834 1,136 1,201 4,354\nDepreciation and amortization 4,127 6,018 7,456 257 17,858\nFiscal year ended June 30, 2020\nGross revenue $ 212,001 $ 424,710 $ 470,871 $ - $ 1,107,582\nLess: inter-segment revenue - 2,839 3,805 - 6,644\nConsolidated revenue 212,001 421,871 467,066 - 1,100,938\nGross profit (loss) 7,081 36,349 61,413 (2,667) 102,176\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 10,047 24,266 26,386 25,577 86,276\nIntangible asset impairments and restructuring costs 27,625 22,914 1,066 920 52,525\nOperating income (loss) (30,591) (10,831) 33,961 (29,164) (36,625)\nSegment assets 67,398 138,734 187,167 124,011 517,310\nCapital expenditures 3,285 7,523 4,921 2,810 18,539\nDepreciation and amortization 3,054 8,014 7,743 313 19,124\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nInformation about Significant Customers:\nSignificant Customers as a Percentage of Segment Revenue\nConsolidated Utility and Power\nInfrastructure Process and Industrial Facilities Storage and Terminal\nSolutions\nFiscal Year ended June 30, 2022\nCustomer one 12.3 % - % 33.5 % 0.8 %\nCustomer two 11.0 % 35.5 % - % - %\nCustomer three 4.7 % 15.1 % - % - %\nFiscal Year ended June 30, 2021\nCustomer one 12.9 % 41.3 % - % - %\nCustomer two 9.9 % - % 33.3 % 0.1 %\nCustomer three 7.0 % 22.5 % - % 0.1 %\nCustomer four 4.4 % - % - % 11.2 %\nFiscal Year ended June 30, 2020\nCustomer one 9.7 % - % 25.4 % - %\nCustomer two 8.2 % 42.7 % - % - %\nCustomer three 8.2 % - % - % 19.3 %\nCustomer four 6.8 % - % - % 16.1 %\nCustomer five 2.0 % 10.5 % - % - %\nNote 14-Restructuring Costs\nIn fiscal 2020, we initiated a business improvement plan to increase profitability and reduce our cost structure in order to help us become more competitive and deliver higher quality service. As a result of specific events, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related market disruptions, the Company expanded its business improvement plan.\nThe business improvement plan consists of an initial phase of discretionary cost reductions, workforce reductions, reduction of capital expenditures and the reduction in size or closure of certain offices in order to increase the utilization of our staff and bring the cost structure of the business in line with revenue volumes. In fiscal 2022, we commenced a second phase of our plan to focus on centralization of support functions, including business development, accounting, human resources, procurement and project services into shared service centers. The restructuring costs consist primarily of severance costs, facility closure costs, consulting fees and other liabilities.\nMatrix Service Company\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nRestructuring costs incurred are classified as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2022 Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2021 Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, 2020 Since Inception of Business Improvement Plan\n(in thousands)\nUtility and Power Infrastructure\nSeverance and other personnel-related costs $ 45 $ 1,199 $ 1,340 $ 2,584\nFacility costs - 113 235 348\nOther intangible asset impairments - - 1,150 1,150\nOther costs 1 - - 1\nTotal Utility and Power Infrastructure $ 46 $ 1,312 $ 2,725 $ 4,083\nProcess and Industrial Facilities\nSeverance and other personnel-related costs $ (22) $ 2,951 $ 6,167 $ 9,096\nFacility costs 17 431 2,757 3,205\nOther intangible asset impairments - - 375 375\nOther costs(1)\n(1,597) 426 - (1,171)\nTotal Process and Industrial Facilities $ (1,602) $ 3,808 $ 9,299 $ 11,505\nStorage and Terminal Solutions\nSeverance and other personnel-related costs $ 69 $ 1,231 $ 347 $ 1,647\nFacility costs - 159 720 879\nOther costs 28 - - 28\nTotal Storage and Terminal Solutions $ 97 $ 1,390 $ 1,067 $ 2,554\nCorporate\nSeverance and other personnel-related costs $ 504 $ 164 $ 919 $ 1,587\nFacility costs 16 82 - 98\nOther costs 1,585 - - 1,585\nTotal Corporate $ 2,105 $ 246 $ 919 $ 3,270\nTotal restructuring costs $ 646 $ 6,756 $ 14,010 $ 21,412\nRestructuring Costs by Type:\nSeverance and other personnel-related costs $ 596 $ 5,545 $ 8,773 $ 14,914\nTotal facility costs 33 785 3,712 4,530\nTotal other intangible asset impairments - - 1,525 1,525\nOther costs 17 426 - 443\nTotal restructuring costs $ 646 $ 6,756 $ 14,010 $ 21,412\n(1)Other costs in the Process and Industrial Facilities segment consisted of a $1.6 million credit in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of disclosure controls and procedures in Rule 13a-15(e).\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level at June 30, 2022.\nOn September 12, 2022, we filed a form 12b-25 with the SEC to notify the Commission that we were not in a position to file this Form 10-K in a timely manner without unreasonable effort or expense for reasons described below. In the course of preparing our financial statements, we discovered that employee support and oversight time for a certain project was allocated to our general overhead expense category rather than to the specific project to which it should have been allocated. We conducted an internal review and determined the amount of misallocated time was immaterial. As a result of this issue, our Audit Committee engaged third-party advisors to conduct a review of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and findings of the investigation. The review confirmed our internal conclusion that the misallocated time was immaterial and the review supported managements conclusion that no material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting exists and that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level at June 30, 2022.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nSee Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting set forth in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
