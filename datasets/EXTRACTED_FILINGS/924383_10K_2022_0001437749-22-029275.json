    "content": "Item 1.\nBusiness.\nOverview\nGenasys is a global provider of critical communications hardware and software solutions designed to alert, inform, and protect people. Our unified platform receives information from a wide variety of sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) inputs to collect real-time information on developing and active emergency situations. Genasys uses this information to create and disseminate alerts, warnings, notifications, and instructions through multiple channels before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats, critical events, and other crisis situations.\nBackground\nGenasys entered the critical communications arena following the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole, which led to the development of the Long Range Acoustic Device\u00ae (LRAD\u00ae), an Acoustic Hailing Device (AHD) capable of communicating to and determining the intent of potential threats from a safe distance. The Companys LRAD systems broadcast audible alert tones and exceptionally intelligible voice messages in a focused 30\u00b0 beam over long distances to specific targets. LRADs were quickly embraced by the U.S. Navy and then other domestic military branches, federal agencies, and police departments, and then throughout the world. By using long-range communication to better manage the escalation of force, LRAD represented a new solution for potentially dangerous or hostile situations.\nWith a device capable of broadcasting audible alerts and notifications with exceptional vocal clarity over long distances, Genasys engineers enhanced the Company's critical communications technology to innovate a new generation of mass notification speaker systems. Most legacy mass notification systems sound sirens, but have limited, if any, voice broadcast capability. Genasys' advanced mass notification systems feature the industry's highest Speech Intelligibility Index (STI), large directional and omni-directional broadcast coverage areas, and an array of options that enable the systems to continue operating when power and telecommunications infrastructure goes down.\nRealizing that integrating software with the mass notification speakers would provide further technology options and additional functionality, Company engineers developed Genasys' Emergency Management (GEM) command-and-control software. In addition to remotely activating and controlling Genasys advanced speaker systems, which feature satellite connectivity and solar power options, GEM facilitates the dissemination of alerts, warnings, notifications, information and instructions through multiple channels, including location-based Short Message Service (SMS), Cell Broadcast Center (CBC) mobile push, text, email, social media, TV, radio, and digital displays. These systems are used by government emergency services, schools, universities, and businesses to send emergency information and instructions to people at risk before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats.\nToday, the fastest most direct way to share vital information is often through cell phones and computers. In response to a world where communication methods are becoming increasingly digital and mobile, Genasys recently expanded its GEM platform to include multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. These solutions include Zonehaven\u00ae evacuation resources, Integrated Mass Notification System (IMNS) networks that feature advanced mass notification powered by GEM command-and-control software, and the Company's National Emergency Warning System (NEWS) solution, a software application that works with mobile carriers to send emergency communications to the public with no opt-in required. These SaaS solutions are capable of disseminating critical alerts and information through text message, email, voice call, push notification, social media, and other delivery methods.\nGenasys hardware systems and software solutions are designed to provide operators the ability to deliver critical information rapidly and effectively through multiple channels.\nGenasys Principal Characteristics\n\u25cf\nScalable: Genasys hardware products and software systems have been deployed throughout the world and can be scaled to meet the needs of government and enterprise customers.\n\u25cf\nDynamic and Real-time: Emergencies and effective emergency responses are not static, and neither are effective emergency responses.

In fiscal year 2023 and beyond, we are focused on the expansion and proliferation of our unified software and hardware platform.\nSoftware Products\nGEM\nGenasys Emergency Management (GEM) is Genasys SaaS product platform that includes GEM Public Safety, GEM Enterprise, Zonehaven and NEWS.\nGEM Public Safety\nGEM Public Safety is an interactive, cloud-based SaaS solution that enables State, Local and Education (SLED) customers to send critical information to at-risk individuals or groups when an emergency occurs. GEM acts as both a communications input and output, receiving information from state-of-the-art sensors and emergency services, and quickly relaying notifications, alerts, and instructions to at-risk populations and first responders. GEM customers can create and send critical, verified, and secure notifications and messages using emails, voice calls, text messages, panic buttons, desktop alerts, television, social media, and more. Additionally, Genasys is a certified provider of Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) notifications. IPAWS is the federal public notification platform for the United States, which GEM Software customers can use to deliver critical communications in multiple languages to specific populations.\nGEM sends targeted messages based on geographic location, permitting relevant information and instructions to be sent to the appropriate populations. Auto-Discovery, an innovative GEM feature, locates and connects with anyone on a wired or wireless network in a fixed area with no opt-in required. When discovered, GEM Software anonymizes all recipient information and data. When an emergency occurs, these tools allow at-risk groups or individuals to be notified as quickly as possible without sacrificing their privacy.\nIn addition to disseminating alerts and notifications, GEM uses two-way communication tools, including polls and check-ins to receive feedback from targeted populations and first responders. With direct feedback, operators can survey the safety and status of at-risk individuals, learn of developments, update notifications and/or instructions in response to new information, and more.\nGEM Public Safety Case Study\nIn fiscal 2022, cities and counties in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas selected GEM to help safeguard millions of residents during severe storms, tornadoes, wildfires, flooding, debris flows, tsunamis, active shooter incidents, epidemics, civil unrest, and other disasters and life safety threats.\nGEM Enterprise\nGEM Enterprise empowers businesses and organizations to send critical communications to at-risk employees, contractors, visitors, or groups based on geographic location or team status.\nOperated and controlled via a single dashboard that includes two-way polling, duress buttons, field check-ins and recipient locations, GEM Enterprise solutions integrate with data sources, including active directories, human resources, visitor management, and building control systems to find and deliver safety alerts and notifications to employees, staff, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors.\nGEM provides full redundancy and high resilience in workforce safety and messaging during everyday duties and critical business events. GEMs accountability and real-time situational awareness translates to effective communications that can be delivered via voice calls, SMS messages, emails, desktop alerts, WhatsApp, and other corporate communication channels anytime, anywhere.\nGEM Enterprise Case Study\nWith 300 community centers across 13 states, a prominent nonprofit organization needed a way to coordinate its COVID-19 response. The pandemics continued growth meant that resources had to be optimized and directed to specific hot spots. Changing requirements and conditions caused by the pandemic highlighted the need for efficient information exchange with personnel and volunteers. To handle these challenges, the nonprofit implemented GEM to ensure critical communications were delivered quickly and reliably.\nZonehaven\nZonehaven is a multipronged SaaS application that serves both first responders and the jurisdictions they protect. Emergency services agencies can prepare for natural or man-made disasters by developing evacuation plans that map routes, shelters, traffic control locations, and road closures using Zonehaven's extensive public safety resources and mapped zones. This information is easily shared with the public and reduces the time it takes to execute emergency evacuations and conduct orderly repopulations.\nWhen an incident occurs, it is immediately tracked by Zonehaven, which maps and simulates the speed and direction of the incident to determine which zones (geographic areas) are at risk and need to be evacuated. As an incident develops, Zonehaven provides real-time updates, helping to ensure emergency services personnel have the most up-to-date information. In turn, emergency services agencies use this information to augment evacuation plans and share critical information with at-risk individuals and populations through alerts, messages, and community-facing mapping applications. Notifications can be sent using Zonehaven and a variety of other channels, including local GIS departments and other agencies, traffic applications, including Waze, and more.\nIn addition to communicating to members of their own community, emergency services agencies can also use Zonehaven to communicate with neighboring towns, cities, and counties. Zonehavens network exists across jurisdictions to facilitate multi-agency collaboration and cooperation. By having access to the shared Zonehaven knowledgebase, emergency organizations can work together across jurisdictions to prepare plans, take responsive action, and coordinate evacuations and repopulations.\nZonehaven Case Study\nSpurred by a geographic and environmental susceptibility to wildfires and recent conflagrations, first responders and emergency services agencies in 27 California counties have entered into multi-year Zonehaven software services and evacuation management contracts to better protect the more than 12 million residents they serve.\nNEWS\nThe National Emergency Warning System (NEWS) provides multichannel public safety notifications and instructions to designated areas, groups, or agencies when a crisis occurs. The NEWS platform is cloud-based, geo-redundant, and end-to-end encrypted. NEWS is a SaaS product that requires mobile telecom services for installation and integration.\nGenasys partners with mobile telecom networks to provide the channels to deliver NEWS SMS and CBC alerts and notifications that can be sent to anyone, anywhere, with no recipient opt-in, registration, or download required. By partnering with government and mobile telecom networks, NEWS provides precise geolocation capabilities (dynamic maps, traffic information, weather forecasts, and environmental sensor data) which allow NEWS operators to receive accurate information, send hyper-specific notifications, and monitor evacuation progress. NEWS can locate recipients and deliver messages in near real time, compared with other SMS alert providers that can take up to 15 minutes. Even with NEWS reach and scope, all data is anonymized, ensuring individuals stay safe and informed without sacrificing their privacy.\nNEWS has an easy-to-use dashboard that can be controlled by operators through a cloud-based command console, or a mobile app. NEWS receives alerts and warnings from multiple sources, which then appear in the dashboard. Operators interpret this information and use it to create, activate, and broadcast notifications to the appropriate population via TCP/IP, satellite, Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM, fiber radio, text message, email, cell broadcast, social media, television, speakers, sirens, and more. NEWS has many capabilities and options, including smart messaging, integration with other communication channels, and geo-fencing. With access to numerous channels and partnerships with mobile carrier networks, NEWS helps ensure at-risk populations are alerted when a local, regional or national emergency occurs.\nNEWS Case Study\nIn the aftermath of devastating bushfires that killed and injured hundreds of citizens and burned thousands of homes in 2009, Australias government decided to create a location-based public warning system that could reach more than 95% of the population affected by bushfires, flooding, severe storms, and other disasters.\nBeginning in particularly susceptible areas and then expanding to cover the entire country, government officials worked with Genasys, major telecom providers, and other companies to develop a location-based SMS public warning system that met the government's public safety warning expectations and national authorities operational and functional system requirements. Since going live in 2013, NEWS has delivered more than 200 million location-based SMS emergency alerts to many of the countrys 25 million residents and 9 million annual visitors.\nHardware Products\nIMNS\nThe Integrated Mass Notification System (IMNS) product line unites Genasys next generation of mass notification speaker systems with GEM command-and-control software. Most legacy mass notification systems use sound sirens, but have limited, if any, voice broadcast capability. Genasys' advanced mass notification systems feature the industry's highest STI, large directional and omni-directional broadcast coverage areas, and an array of options that enable the systems to continue to operate when power and telecommunications infrastructure goes down.\nIMNS gives operators the ability to send critical alerts and notifications from emergency operations centers, and authorized computers or smart phones. Emergency alerts and information can be sent via individual, grouped or networked IMNS installations, text messages, emails, IPAWS, desktop alerts, television, voice calls, and social media. IMNS' layered redundancy helps to ensure the maximum number of people receive critical communications.\nIMNS Case Study\nFaced with wildfires, flooding, debris flows, earthquakes, tsunamis, severe weather and other public safety threats, a California beach city selected IMNS to deliver emergency alerts and notifications to its 23,000 residents and 6 million annual visitors. 21 IMNS installations are in place throughout the city with more installations planned. The IMNS installations can be activated individually, in groups, or simultaneously to provide area specific or citywide emergency warning coverage. The IMNS outdoor speaker installations are equipped with solar power, battery backup, and satellite connectivity. In the event power and telecommunications infrastructure fails, alerts and notifications can also be sent via text messages, voice calls, and social media.\nLRAD\nThe LRAD is the worlds leading AHD. Projecting alert tones and audible voice messages with exceptional vocal clarity in a 30\u00b0 beam from close range to 5,500 meters. LRADs are used throughout the world in multiple applications and circumstances to safely hail, warn, inform, direct, prevent misunderstandings, determine intent, establish large safety zones, resolve uncertain situations, and save lives. LRADs have been deployed on military vehicles, at corporate headquarters, in hostage negotiations, aboard private yachts, and in numerous other situations where clear and intelligible voice communications are essential.\nSeveral LRAD models are available in varying audio output, communication coverage area, size, and functionality. Several options and accessories (cameras, searchlights, mounts, etc.) are also available to enhance LRAD capabilities.\nAll LRADs are defined by their unparalleled audio output and clarity. LRADs use Genasys' proprietary XL driver technology, which generates higher audio output in a smaller and lighter form factor. The technology also helps ensure voice messages and alert tones cut through background noise and are clearly heard and understood. These competitive advantages, and constant innovation, have made LRAD the de facto standard of the global AHD industry.\nLRAD Case Study\nSWAT teams respond to dangerous situations where communication is vital. Previously, SWAT teams used bullhorns and vehicle public address (PA) systems to communicate with violent suspects. Because of the poor intelligibility and limited broadcast range of bullhorns and vehicle PA systems, SWAT team members often had to closely engage with suspects, putting themselves, suspects, and bystanders in harm's way.\nMany SWAT teams now use LRAD for serving high risk warrants, during hostage and barricaded suspect negotiations, active shooter situations, and other SWAT operations. LRAD systems are portable and adaptable in most any situation to provide clear voice broadcasts over long distances. By effectively communicating from safe standoff distances, LRAD helps resolve uncertain situations, safeguards operators and protects the public.\nApplications\nGovernment\nGEM provides state, local, and federal agencies a feature-rich system that combines physical security integrations with multichannel emergency alerting. Automated integrations include fire system, access control, IPAWS, mobile and desktop panic buttons. Output channels include 2-way SMS, email, pop-ups, callouts, PA speakers, and land mobile radio outputs.\nIMNS can be used by state, local, or national agencies to deliver emergency alerts and life safety information to residents in certain areas, regionally, or countrywide.\nPartnering with national governments and mobile telecom networks, NEWS delivers CBC alerts and geo-targeted SMS notifications that can be sent to anyone, anywhere, with no recipient opt-in, registration, or download required.\nLRAD systems enhance the safety and security of government-owned critical infrastructure including dams, power plants, water treatment plants, and government facilities. Unlike traditional monitoring and surveillance networks, LRAD systems provide a vital first response capability missing from observe-only integrated security installations. LRAD turns passive monitoring systems into first responders by broadcasting attention-commanding alerts, warnings, and critical notifications with industry-leading audibility and clarity.\nEnterprise\nGEM provides full redundancy and high resilience in workforce safety and messaging during everyday duties and critical business events. GEMs accountability and real-time situational awareness translates to effective communications that can be delivered via voice calls, SMS messages, emails, desktop alerts, WhatsApp, and other corporate communication channels to reach workers, on-premises visitors, and contractors with no opt-in required.\nGEM can be operated and controlled via a single dashboard that includes two-way polling, duress buttons, field check-ins and recipient locations. GEM enterprise solutions integrate with data sources, including active directories, human resources, visitor management and building control systems to find and reach employees, staff, contractors, temporary workers and visitors.\nLRAD systems are being used for commercial security applications at large data centers, publicly-owned critical infrastructure, and other enterprise facilities.\nGas, Oil, Utilities\nGEM integrates with a variety of industrial technologies, including gas leak sensors, 'man down' alarms, access control systems, and badge scanners for workforce safety and accountability. GEM delivers notifications to employees, contractors, visitors, and guests in corporate offices and at field sites. When integrated with human resources systems, GEM provides employee notifications, guest management systems for contractors and visitors, auto discovery alerts to anyone present on-site, and SMS opt-in for temporary enrollment to receive alerts and notifications.\nIn addition to providing real-time safety alerts and notifications through multiple channels, GEM can provide service outage, system maintenance, and other utility customer communications.\nIMNS is being used for emergency warning, industrial safety notification, and facility public address. IMNS can be integrated with gas detection and other sensors to provide automated alerts that protect workers and minimize infrastructure damage. IMNS alert tones and voice messages cut though mechanical and ambient background noise to be clearly heard and understood, before, during, and in the aftermath of emergency events.\nLRAD systems enhance the perimeter security by providing a vital first response capability missing from observe-only integrated security installations. LRAD turns passive monitoring systems into first responders by broadcasting attention-commanding alerts, warnings, and commands to direct fishing boats away from offshore platforms and trespassers from oil, gas, and utility infrastructure.\nNon-Profit\nGEM can assign tasks, monitor progress, and send alerts when tasks exceed assigned parameters. GEM can deliver multilingual alerts to workers, volunteers, and staff anywhere in the world, including automatic translations and localization into any language. Alerts are delivered anytime, anywhere over SMS, email, push, voice calls, social media and website postings.\nCampuses\nIMNS unifies software emergency alerting and highly intelligible indoor/outdoor speaker systems to provide multiple channels to deliver notifications, instructions and information to students, staff, faculty, and employees. Using GEM command-and- control software, safety alerts can be delivered campus-wide across several channels, or to specific areas and student populations using select channels.\nTowns, Cities, Counties\nGEMs scalable notification software is used in communities of all sizes to reach residential populations quickly and directly. GEM is used to issue emergency alerts, provide important instructions, and receive community feedback.\nIMNS serves communities by providing digital communications through SMS, email, social media, and other channels, and broadcasting audible messages through Genasys speaker system installations. During wildfires, flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and other emergencies, power and telecom outages frequently disrupt legacy emergency warning systems. Genasys speaker systems are made with rugged, military-grade materials that can withstand the elements, and feature solar power, satellite connectivity, and battery backup that enable emergency services personnel to disseminate critical information even when power and telecommunications infrastructure goes down.\nZonehaven is used by communities and counties to create disaster response plans, track emergency events, and execute timely emergency evacuations and orderly repopulations. Zonehaven allows emergency services to effectively collaborate across jurisdictions to respond quickly and efficiently to disasters. Zonehaven emergency services include notifications, alerts, and instructions sent directly to community members through several channels, including SMS, email, Waze, and more.\nIndustrial Facilities\nWhen integrated with software and/or hardware sensors, IMNS provides facility managers actionable data and information to either remotely or automatically initiate critical safety notifications. These notifications can be delivered throughout a facility or only to areas affected by industrial accidents, hazmat incidents, unauthorized entries, and other life-safety threats.\nDefense\nLRADs broadcast audible warning tones and voice messages with exceptional clarity from close range to 5,500 meters. This allows LRAD operators on the ground, in vehicles, on ships, or in helicopters, to increase the decision time and distance to differentiate between security threats and non-combatants, resolve uncertain situations, respond safely, and limit the escalation of force.\nFirst Response\nPolice and fire departments can use LRAD systems in everyday duties and elevated risk operations to issue warnings, commands, and notifications that are clearly heard and understood above crowd and background noise. Rugged, reliable, and easy to operate, LRAD systems resolve uncertain situations, safeguard the public, and protect first responders.\nWildlife & Assets\nCertain facilities and infrastructure face challenges from wildlife that can threaten assets or pose health risks to employees and/or local populations. LRADs are easily programmed to broadcast a near infinite variety of tones and predator calls to safely deter and protect wildlife from potential hazards and help prevent habituation. When integrated with cameras, motion sensors, night vision, and radar, LRAD systems can be automated and remotely operated across an IP network to provide critical asset operators a completely unmanned perimeter protection solution capable of safely deterring wildlife and human incursions.\nStrategy\nOur products, systems and solutions continue to gain worldwide awareness and recognition through media exposure, product demonstrations, and word of mouth as a result of positive responses and increased acceptance. We believe we have a solid global brand, technology, and product foundation, which we continue to expand to serve new markets and customers for greater business growth. We believe we have strong market opportunities for our product offerings throughout the world in the defense, public safety, emergency warning, mass notification, critical event management, and law enforcement sectors as a result of increasing threats to government, commerce, law enforcement, homeland security and critical infrastructure. Our products, systems and solutions also have many applications within the fire rescue, maritime, asset protection, and wildlife control and preservation business segments.\nGenasys has developed a global market and an increased demand for LRADs and advanced mass notification speakers. We have a reputation for producing quality products that feature industry-leading broadcast area coverage, vocal intelligibility and product reliability. We plan to continue building on our AHD market leadership position by offering enhanced voice broadcast systems and accessories for an expanding range of applications. In executing our strategy, we use direct sales to governments, militaries, large end-users, system integrators, and prime vendors. We have built a worldwide distribution channel consisting of partners and resellers that have significant expertise and experience selling integrated communication solutions into our various target markets. As our primary AHD sales opportunities are with domestic and international governments, military branches, and law enforcement agencies, we are subject to each customers unique budget cycle, which leads to long selling cycles and uneven revenue flow, complicating our product planning.\nThe proliferation of natural and man-made disasters, emergency events and civil unrest require technologically advanced, multichannel solutions to deliver clear and timely critical communications to help keep people safe during crisis situations. Businesses are also incorporating critical communication and emergency management systems that locate and help safeguard employees when crises occur.\nBy providing the only SaaS platform that unifies sensors and IoT inputs with multichannel, multiagency alerting and notifications, Genasys seeks to deliver reliable, fast, and intuitive solutions for creating and disseminating geolocation-targeted warnings, information and instructions before, during, and after public safety and ennterprise threats.\nWhile the software and hardware mass notification markets are more mature with many established manufacturers and suppliers, we believe that our advanced technology and unified platform provides opportunities to succeed in the large and growing public safety, emergency warning and critical communications markets.\nIn fiscal 2023, we intend to continue pursuing domestic and international business opportunities with the support of business development consultants, key representatives, and resellers. We plan to grow our revenues through increased direct sales to governments and agencies that desire to integrate our communication technologies into their homeland security and public safety systems. This includes building on fiscal 2022 domestic defense sales by pursuing further U.S. military opportunities. We also plan to pursue emergency warning, enterprise and critical event management, government, law enforcement, fire rescue, homeland and international security, private and commercial security, border security, maritime security, and wildlife preservation and control business opportunities.\nOur research and development strategy includes incorporating further innovations and capabilities into our GEM, IMNS, Zonehaven, NEWS and LRAD products, systems, and solutions to meet the needs of our target markets.\nOur GEM, Zonehaven and NEWS software solutions are more complex offerings. We are pursuing certain certifications, which are often required when bidding on government and mass notification opportunities. We intend to invest engineering resources to enhance our GEM, Zonehaven, and NEWS software solutions to compete for larger emergency warning and critical communications business opportunities. We are also configuring alternative solutions to achieve lower price points to meet the needs of certain customers or applications. We also engage in ongoing value engineering to reduce the cost and simplify the manufacturing of our products.\nWe intend to continue operating with financial discipline in order to create value for our shareholders.\nManufacturing and Suppliers\nManufacturing\nAs an ISO 9001:2015 manufacturer, we believe maintaining quality manufacturing capacity is essential to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our technologies are different from mass-produced designs, and our manufacturing and assembly involves unique processes and materials. We contract with third-party suppliers to produce various components and sub-assemblies. In our facility, we complete the final assembly, test, and ship our products. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test, and qualify products. We continue to implement rigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field failures. We also perform third-party testing and certification of our products to ensure that they meet rigorous military and commercial specifications. We implement design and component changes periodically to reduce our product costs and improve product reliability and manufacturability.\nSuppliers\nWe minimize inventories and maximize the efficiency of our supply chain by having a large number of components and sub-assemblies produced by outside suppliers mainly located within 50 miles of our facility. The Company relies on one supplier for compression drivers for its LRAD products and is working to obtain alternative suppliers to reduce such reliance. The Companys ability to manufacture its products could be adversely affected if it were to lose this sole source supplier and was unable to find an alternative supplier. We also purchase several key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact that supply chain issues and economic conditions can have on such suppliers. The fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates could also impact our lead times and product costs. We have developed strong relationships with a number of our key suppliers. If these suppliers experience supply chain issues, quality problems or part shortages, our production schedules could be significantly delayed, or our costs could significantly increase.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market and sell products and services through our salesforce based in California, Colorado, Florida, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Canada, Singapore, Spain, and the U.A.E., as well as through a full-time business consultant in Germany. Our corporate and administrative offices are located in San Diego, California.\nWe sell directly to governments, militaries, large end-users, and commercial companies. We use independent representatives on a commission basis to assist in our direct sales efforts. We also use a channel distribution model, in which we sell our products directly to independent resellers and system integrators around the world, who then sell our products (or our products integrated with other systems) to end-user customers. We are focusing our internal business development resources on building relationships with governments and other large direct customers. In addition, we utilize part-time consultants with expertise in various government and defense sectors to advise us on procedures and budgetary policies in an effort to be successful in these areas.\nWe have a global reputation for providing high quality, innovative voice broadcast systems and mobile alert solutions that have made Genasys and LRAD internationally recognized product brands. We actively promote our brands and products through our website, trade shows, and advertising. We intend to increase the use of our trademarks throughout our product distribution chain and believe growing brand awareness will assist in expanding our business. We believe our reputation for technological expertise, quality products, and strong service and support provide us competitive advantages.\nCustomer Concentration\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, one customer accounted for 68% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, one customer accounted for 58% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues.\nOur revenues to date have relied on a few major customers. The loss of any customer could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We have made progress diversifying our revenues and expect to continue to do so in future periods.\nBacklog\nOur order backlog for products that are deliverable in the next 12 months was approximately $21.7 million as of September 30, 2022, compared with $36.0 million as of September 30, 2021. The amount of backlog at any point in time is dependent upon scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Our backlog orders are supported by firm purchase orders.\nWarranties\nWe generally warrant our products to be free from material and workmanship defects for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. The warranty is generally a limited warranty, and in some instances imposes certain shipping costs on the customer. We generally provide direct warranty service, but at times we may establish warranty service through third parties.\nWe also provide repair and maintenance agreements and extended warranty contracts at market rates, with terms ranging from one year to several years, as an additional source of revenue and to provide increased customer satisfaction.\nCompetition\nOur technologies and products compete with those of other companies. Our LRAD AHDs and advanced mass notification speakers are part of the commercial and government audio industry and mass notification markets that are fragmented and include numerous manufacturers with products that vary widely in price, quality, and distribution channels. Present and potential competitors have, or may have, substantially greater resources to devote to product development. We believe we compete primarily on the originality of our products, the uniqueness of our technology and designs, and our responsiveness to customers and the ability to meet their needs. We believe the quality, reliability and superior performance of our products, which have been developed by incorporating feedback from our customers and our desire to provide the highest quality products, also provide us competitive advantages.\nOur LRAD product line includes the leading long-range voice broadcast systems for military and other applications. Our AHD competitors include Ultra Electronics/USSI, IML Sound Commander and others. We do not believe these competitors have achieved significant global market penetration in the AHD market to date. We believe our LRAD product line has demonstrated acceptance, has performed extremely well in harsh environments, and can continue to compete on the basis of technical features, performance, ease of use, quality and cost. As we continue to grow this market, future competitors may enter, which could impact our competitiveness.\nOur advanced mass notification speakers compete against several domestic and international companies, including Federal Signal, Whelen Engineering Company, Hoermann, and others. We believe our industry-leading voice intelligibility and area coverage, as well as our satellite connectivity and solar power options, provide key advantages that distinguish us from our competitors. When integrated with our GEM command-and-control software to provide multiple remote activation and control options, we believe our mass notification speakers are among the most technologically advanced and easiest to operate in the world.\nIn the more mature and established critical communications and event management markets, we compete against several competitors, including Everbridge, OnSolve, Rave Mobile Safety, and others. We believe our ability to unify sensors and IoT inputs with the multichannel, multiagency dissemination of geolocation-targeted alerts, notifications and instructions before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats, critical events, and other crisis situations, gives us significant competitive advantages against these established organizations. Our reliable, fast, and intuitive solution for sending warnings and information via location-based SMS, CBC, mobile push, text, email, social media, TV, radio, digital displays, sirens and speaker arrays, and our platforms compatibility with major emergency warning protocols, including IPAWS, WEA, and others, provide additional competitive advantages. We believe the domestic and international markets for public safety, emergency warning, and critical communications are substantial and growing.\nSeasonality\nBecause our sales are primarily to domestic and international government departments or agencies, our selling cycles tend to be long and difficult to forecast. We have not experienced any significant seasonality trends to date, but we may experience increased seasonality in the future.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of government laws and regulations that apply to companies engaged in international operations, including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Department of Commerce export controls, local government regulations and procurement policies and practices (including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings). We maintain controls and procedures to comply with laws and regulations associated with our international operations. If we are unable to remain compliant with such laws and regulations, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur products are produced to comply with standard product safety requirements for sale in the U.S. and similar requirements for sale in Europe and Canada. We expect to meet the electrical and other regulatory requirements for electronic systems or components we sell throughout the world.\nFinancial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nFinancial information regarding our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in Note 18, Segment Information, and Note 19, Major Customers, Suppliers and Related Information to our consolidated financial statements.\nIntellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information\nWe operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas, and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are important drivers of success. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and contractual obligations. We pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing our intellectual property rights.\nIn addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise, and experienced personnel, we believe strong product offerings that are continually upgraded and enhanced will keep us competitive, and we seek patent protection on important technological improvements that we make. We have an ongoing policy of filing patent applications to seek protection for novel features of our products and technologies. Prior to the filing and granting of patents, our policy is to disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. Patent applications may not result in issued patents covering all-important claims and could be denied in their entirety. We also file for trade name and trademark protection when appropriate. We are the owner of several registered trademarks, many of which have earned worldwide brand recognition.\nOur policy is to enter into nondisclosure agreements with each employee and consultant or third party to whom any of our proprietary information is disclosed. These agreements prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to others, both during and subsequent to employment, or the duration of the working relationship. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of confidential information or provide adequate remedies for any breach.\nResearch and Development\nThe software and sound reproduction markets are subject to rapid changes in technology and design with frequent improvements and new product introductions, as well as customized solutions for specific customer applications. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve existing technologies and to introduce new technologies and products on a competitive basis that meet the needs of our customers. Accordingly, we are continuing to invest in significant research and new product development activities.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we spent approximately $7.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, on company-sponsored research and development. Future levels of research and development expenditures will vary depending on the timing of further new product development and the availability of funds to carry on additional research and development on currently owned technologies or in other areas.\nExecutive Officers\nThe current executive officers of Genasys Inc. and their ages and business experience are set forth below.\nRichard S. Danforth, age 63, was appointed Chief Executive Officer in August 2016. Mr. Danforth formed the strategic business consulting firm, RsD Aero, Ltd., in 2014, which provided consulting services for the Defense, Aerospace, Space and Transportation sectors, with an emphasis on M&A and Transatlantic trade. He served at DRS Technologies as Group President of DRS Integrated Defense Systems & Service (2013 - 2014); Chief Executive Officer, President and Board Member of DRS Defense Solutions (2008 - 2012); President, Command Control & Communication (2005 - 2008); President, Navy Electronics & Intelligence Systems (2004 - 2005); and Executive Vice President, Electronics Systems Group (2002 - 2004). He began his career at Raytheon in 1982 and held various manufacturing, quality assurance and program manager positions until 1996. Mr. Danforth was then appointed Vice President of Operations for Raytheon Aircraft Company (1996 - 2000). In 2000, he was named Senior Vice President of Raytheon Aircraft Companys Commercial Aircraft Business division, where he led a staff of 370 sales, marketing and customer service personnel. Mr. Danforth holds a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology from the University of Massachusetts Lowell and a Masters in Engineering Management from Western New England College.\nDennis D. Klahn, age 64, was appointed Chief Financial Officer in September 2017. Mr. Klahn has more than 30 years of accounting, finance and operations experience, which includes serving as Controller or CFO at publicly traded companies. He was most recently a Group Controller at Teledyne RD Instruments, a subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, between 2011 and August 2017. Prior to that role, he served as Controller or CFO at several companies including, ISE Corporation, Overland Storage, Inc., Anacomp, Inc., and International Lottery & Totalizator Systems, Inc. Mr. Klahn is a certified public accountant in Illinois and began his career as a Staff Accountant at Coopers & Lybrand after receiving his B.A. in Accounting from St. Ambrose University.\nHuman Capital\nAs of September 30, 2022, we employed a total of 172 full-time employees, of which 94 were located in the United States and 78 were located internationally. Our full-time employees include, 93 in engineering, 22 in production, quality assurance and materials control, 18 in general and administrative and 39 in sales and marketing. We contract technical and production personnel from time to time on an as needed basis and use outside consultants for various services. In addition, we have an extensive worldwide network of independent representatives and resellers who actively market and sell our products. We have not experienced any work stoppages and are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement.\nWe are dedicated to preserving operational excellence and remaining an employer of choice. We provide and maintain a work environment that is designed to attract, develop, and retain top talent through offering our employees an engaging work experience that contributes to their career development. We recognize that our success is based on the collective talents and dedication of those we employ, and we are highly invested in their success.\nCOVID -19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we monitor the developments and assess areas where there is potential for our business to be impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to manage it, including those by governmental authorities, have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the economy. Disruptions in the supply chain have affected our ability to source and the cost of certain materials for some of our hardware products. We have managed these supply disruptions by sourcing comparable materials or redesigning product modules using more readily available parts. While we do not currently anticipate a material reduction in demand for our commercialized products, we could experience a decrease in new orders, which could negatively impact our revenues and reduce our liquidity and cash flows. The financial markets have been subject to significant volatility that could impact our ability to enter into, modify, and negotiate favorable terms and conditions relative to equity and debt financing activities. We have $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022, which we believe provides sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, although liquidity constraints and access to capital markets could adversely impact our liquidity and warrant changes to our investment strategy. Any of the aforementioned circumstances, as well as other factors, may cause our results of operations to vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter.\nAvailable Information\nOur shares of common stock trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol GNSS. Our address is 16262 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, California, 92127, our telephone number is 858-676-1112, and our website is located at www.genasys.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, reports filed by our directors, executive officers and certain significant shareholders pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practical after the reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report nor is it part of this report. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our company. You should consider these matters in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Our results of operations or financial condition could be seriously harmed, and the trading price of our common stock may decline due to any of these or other risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nGeneral economic and political conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic and political conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and government spending. Global economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations could adversely influence demand for our products leading to reduced levels of investments, reductions in government spending and budgets and changes in spending priorities and behavior.\nRisks related to global economic instability, including global supply chain issues, inflation, labor costs, and fuel and energy costs, may affect the Companys business.\nThe increasingly volatile global economic environment has created market uncertainty. A slowdown in the financial markets or other economic conditions, including but not limited to global supply chain issues, inflation, fuel and energy costs, freight costs, lack of available credit, interest rates, and tax rates, may adversely affect the Companys growth and profitability. Fluctuation of prices and availability of commodities and materials used in the manufacture of our products may affect the cost of operations. In addition, increasing wage inflation and challenges hiring qualified personnel may impact our ability to meet customer demand. While we expect the impacts of market uncertainty and inflation could have an effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nWe may need additional capital for growth.\nWe may need additional capital to support our growth. While we expect to generate these funds from operations, we may not be able to do so. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:\nfailure of sales to government, military and commercial markets to meet planned projections;\ngovernment spending levels impacting sales of our products;\npolitical uncertainty;\nforeign currency fluctuations;\nworking capital requirements to support business growth;\nour ability to control spending;\nour ability to integrate future acquisitions;\nmanagement of new business opportunities;\nintroduction of new competing technologies;\nproduct mix and effect on margins;\nacceptance of our existing and future products in existing and new markets; and\nimpact of COVID-19 on global market conditions.\nShould we require additional funds, general market conditions or the then-current market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions and any such financing may require advance approval of our stockholders under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our ability to obtain financing may be further constrained by prevailing economic conditions. We may be required to reduce costs, including the scaling back of research and development into new products, which could have a negative impact on our ability to compete and to innovate. If we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock (assuming we are able to obtain additional financing), the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our common stock.\nWe have historically had a high concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers. We expect to continue to be dependent on a limited number of customers.\nIn fiscal year 2022, one customer that accounted for 68% of revenues and no other customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues. Historically, our revenues have been dependent upon a limited number of customers, and we expect that we will continue to have some significant customers in future years. We do not have long-term purchase commitments with these or other significant customers, and our customers have the right to cease doing business with us at any time. Military contracts that we have been awarded have terms of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity during the term of the contract, so there are no guaranteed purchases under these contracts. No assurance can be given that these or other customers will continue to do business with us or that they will maintain their historical levels of business. If our relationship with any material customer were to cease, then our revenues would decline and negatively impact our results of operations. Any such decline could result in us increasing our accumulated deficit and a need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. If our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls.\nDisruption and fluctuations in financial and currency markets could have a negative effect on our business.\nFinancial markets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia have experienced extreme volatility and uncertainty in recent years. Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions. It is difficult to assess the extent to which these conditions have impacted our business, and the affect this has had on certain of our customers and suppliers. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Any tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of commercial customers to finance purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products as well as create supplier disruptions. Reductions in tax revenues, rating downgrades and other economic developments could also reduce future government spending on our products. There can be no assurance that there will not be further volatility and uncertainty in financial markets, which can then lead to challenges in the operation of our business. We are unable to predict the likely effects that negative economic conditions will have on our business and financial condition.\nWe purchase a number of key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact economic conditions can have on such suppliers and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases in our cost of purchasing these items could negatively impact our financial results if we are not able to pass these increased costs on to our customers.\nWe have current government contracts, and our future growth is dependent, in large part, on continued sales to U.S. and international governments and businesses that sell to governments.\nIn fiscal year 2022, direct and indirect sales to the U.S. government accounted for approximately 71% of our total net sales, compared with 68% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2021, and 64% in fiscal year 2020. Changes in defense spending could have an adverse effect on our current and future revenues. Sales of our products to U.S. government agencies and organizations are subject to the overall U.S. government budget and congressional appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. Even awards granted may not result in orders due to spending constraints. Similar issues apply to sales to international governments. We have no assurance that military interest in communication devices to minimize unnecessary use of force will continue or will provide future growth opportunities for our business.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related implications may negatively impact our operations.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result, the U.S. and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions, as well as potential retaliatory actions by Russia, that could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict or the impact of sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell, ship products, collect payments, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, supply disruptions, and logistics restrictions, including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from supply chain and logistics challenges. Given the evolving nature of this conflict, the related sanctions, potential governmental actions and economic impact, such potential impacts remain uncertain. While we expect the impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could have an effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nWe must expand our customer base in order to grow our business.\nTo grow our business, in addition to continuing to obtain additional orders from our existing customers, we must develop relationships with new customers and obtain and fulfill orders from new customers. We are competing against a number of large competitors in the mass notification market, and we need to establish our product offerings as competitive to win awards against these competitors, increase our customer base and gain market share. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our customer base. Further, even if we do obtain new customers, we cannot guarantee that those customers will purchase from us in sufficient quantities or at product prices that will enable us to recover our costs in acquiring those customers and fulfilling those orders. Whether we will be able to sell more of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\nour ability to design and manufacture reliable products that have the features that are required by our customers;\nthe global economy;\nour ability to expand relationships with existing customers and to develop relationships with new customers that will lead to additional orders for our products;\nour ability to develop and expand new markets for directed sound products, mobile mass messaging services, and integrated solutions; and\nour ability to develop international product distribution directly or through strategic partners.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions in the future, and we may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings, revenue enhancements, or other synergies from such acquisitions.\nOn January 18, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Genasys Holding S.L. (Genasys Spain), on October 2, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets and business of Amika Mobile Corporation (Amika Mobile) and on June 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Zonehaven Inc. (Zonehaven). Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and achieve targeted financial results and other benefits including, among other things, greater market presence and development, and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base, is dependent on our ability to successfully identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions, including Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile and Zonehaven, as well as other businesses we may acquire in the future. We may not realize the intended benefits of the Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile or Zonehaven acquisitions or the acquisition of other businesses in the future as rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated by our management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile or Zonehaven businesses or any other acquired businesses, products or technologies without substantial expenses, delays or other operational or financial problems. Acquisitions, including our acquisition of Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile and Zonehaven, involve a number of risks, some or all which could have a material adverse effect on our acquired businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile and Zonehaven businesses or any other acquired business, product, or technology will be profitable or achieve anticipated revenues and income. Our failure to manage our acquisition and integration strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The process of integrating an acquired business involves risks, including but not limited to:\ndemands on management related to changes in the size and possible locations of our businesses and employees;\ndiversion of management's attention from the management of daily operations;\ndifficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, employees and business practices;\ndifficulties in conforming the acquired businesses accounting policies to ours;\nretaining the loyalty and business of the employees or customers of acquired businesses;\nretaining employees that may be vital to the integration of acquired businesses or to the future prospects of the combined businesses;\ndifficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of departments, information technology systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, and maintaining uniform standards, such as internal accounting controls, procedures, and policies;\ncosts and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities;\nthe use of more cash or other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect; and\nour ability to avoid labor disruptions in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with any headcount reduction.\nFailure to successfully integrate Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile, Zonehaven or any other acquired business in the future may result in reduced levels of anticipated revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency than might have been achieved if we had not acquired such businesses.\nIn addition, the acquisition of Genasys Spain, Amika Mobile, Zonehaven and any future businesses could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, contingent liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, as well as the issuance of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.\nPerceptions that long-range hailing devices are unsafe or may be used in an abusive manner may hurt sales of our products, which could cause our revenues to decline.\nPotential customers for our products, including government, military, and emergency response agencies, may be influenced by claims or perceptions that long-range hailing devices are unsafe or may be used in an abusive manner. These claims or perceptions, which we believe are unsubstantiated, could reduce our product sales.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our core product category.\nWe are dependent on our core directional product category to generate our revenues. While we have expanded our product offering to include omnidirectional products and SaaS systems and solutions, no assurance can be given that our core directional products will continue to have market acceptance or that they will maintain their historical levels of sales. The loss or reduction of sales of this product category could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe may not successfully penetrate the mass notification market.\nThe mass notification market is substantial in size and projected to grow globally over the next five years. While there are a number of large companies already established in this market, we believe our unique SaaS systems and solutions, the clear, intelligible voice capability of our Genasys speaker products, and our unified software/hardware platform provide us with competitive advantages. Based on the increase in global public safety and enterprise threats, we continue to invest in marketing, selling, and software development resources to become successful in this growing market. However, we are competing against established competitors that have greater resources and have successfully penetrated the market.\nOur margins could be impacted as we expand into the emergency response and mass notification market.\nOur sales strategy for fiscal year 2023 and beyond is to increase our share of the growing emergency response and mass notification market with our critical communications solutions. A number of large companies currently have a substantial share of the market. While we believe we have a strong product platform that can successfully compete against these larger players, given the highly competitive environment, we expect to confront pricing pressures, which may negatively impact our overall margins.\nWe may incur significant and unpredictable warranty costs.\nOur products are substantially different from proven, mass produced sound transducer designs and are often employed in harsh environments. We may incur substantial and unpredictable warranty costs from post-production product or component failures. We generally warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. We also sell extended repair and maintenance contracts with terms ranging from one to several years, which provide repair and maintenance services after expiration of the original limited warranty. As of September 30, 2022, we had a warranty reserve of $0.1 million. While our warranty experience with our product line has been favorable, as we build more complexity into the product, and as we expand our supplier base, issues could arise that could affect future warranty costs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and business prospects.\nSystem disruptions and security threats to our computer networks, including breach of our or our customers confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nOur computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to interruption, malfunction or damage due to events beyond our control, including malicious human acts committed by foreign or domestic persons, natural disasters, and network and communications failures. We periodically perform vulnerability self-assessments and engage service providers to perform independent vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. However, despite network security measures, our servers and the servers at our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyberattacks, and other security problems and system disruptions. Increasing socioeconomic and political instability in some countries has heightened these risks. Despite the precautions we and our service providers have taken, our systems may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations.\nAdditionally, the confidential information that we collect subjects us to additional risks and costs that could harm our business and our reputation. We collect, retain and use personal information of our employees, including personally identifiable information, tax return information, financial data, bank account information, and other data. Although we employ various network and business security measures to limit access to and use of such personal information, we cannot guarantee that a third party will not circumvent such security measures, resulting in the breach, loss or theft of the personal information of our employees. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could restrict our use of personal information and require notification of data breaches. A violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection, retention or use of personal information could also result in the imposition of fines or lawsuits against us.\nSustained or repeated system failures or security breaches that interrupt our ability to process information in a timely manner or that result in a breach of proprietary or personal information could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, available insurance proceeds may not be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nWe could incur additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory.\nWhile we strive to effectively manage our inventory, rapidly changing technology and uneven customer demand may result in short product cycles. The value of our inventory may be adversely affected by changes in technology that affect our ability to sell the products in our inventory. If we do not effectively forecast and manage our inventory, we may need to write off inventory as excess or obsolete, which in turn can adversely affect cost of sales and gross profit.\nWe have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, reductions in sales of older generation products as customers delay or defer purchases in anticipation of new product introductions. We have established reserves for slow moving or obsolete inventory of $0.9 million as of September 30, 2022. The reserves we have established for potential losses due to obsolete inventory may, however, prove to be inadequate and may give rise to additional charges for obsolete or excess inventory.\nMany potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or inferior.\nTechnological competition from larger, more established electronic and loudspeaker manufacturers and software providers is expected to increase. Most of the companies with which we expect to compete have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, marketing and distribution programs, and facilities, and many of them have substantially greater experience in the production and marketing of products. In addition, one or more of our competitors may have developed, or may succeed in developing, technologies and products that are more effective than ours, rendering our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive.\nAdverse resolution of disputes, litigation and claims may harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may become a party to litigation, disputes, and claims in the normal course of our business. Litigation is by its nature uncertain and unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not exceed the amounts accrued for such claims, if any. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur competitive position will be seriously damaged if we cannot protect intellectual property rights and trade secrets in our technology.\nWe rely on a combination of contracts, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. However, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to independently develop competing technologies, or the agreements we enter into may not be enforceable. A competitor may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent to, or superior to, our technology. If this happens, our competitive position could be significantly harmed.\nWe may face personal injury and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWhile our products have been engineered to reduce the risk of damage to human hearing or human health, we could be exposed to claims of hearing damage if the product is not properly operated. A person injured in connection with the use of our products may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories, including personal injury, negligent design, dangerous product or inadequate warning. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. Our product liability insurance coverage may be insufficient to pay all such claims. Product liability insurance may also become too costly for us or may become unavailable to us in the future. We may not have sufficient resources to satisfy any product liability claims not covered by insurance, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Significant litigation could also result in negative publicity and a diversion of managements attention and resources.\nOur international operations could be harmed by factors including political instability, natural disasters, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and changes in regulations that govern international transactions.\nWe sell our products worldwide. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, revenues outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 15% and 19% of net revenues, respectively. The risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business and the businesses of our customers and our suppliers. These risks include:\nchanges in tariff regulations;\npolitical instability, war, terrorism, and other political risks;\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\nestablishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and dealers;\nlengthy shipping times and accounts receivable payment cycles;\nimport and export control and licensing requirements, particularly in connection with sales and licensing to foreign governments and other customers;\ncompliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, by us or key subcontractors;\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\ngreater difficulty in safeguarding our technology, proprietary data, and intellectual property in international jurisdictions than in the U.S.; and\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations.\nThese and other risks may preclude or curtail international sales or increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing the demand for our products. Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to international business, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations, could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. and foreign governments.\nCurrent environmental laws, or laws enacted in the future, may harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulation in areas in which we conduct business. Our product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including restrictions on lead, cadmium, and other substances. We do not expect that the impact of these environmental laws and other similar legislation adopted in the U.S. and other countries will have a substantial unfavorable impact on our business. However, the costs and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.\nErrors or defects contained in our products, failure to comply with applicable safety standards or a product recall could result in delayed shipments or rejection of our products, damage to our reputation, and expose us to regulatory or other legal action.\nAny defects or errors in the operation of our products may result in delays in their introduction. In addition, errors or defects may be uncovered after commercial shipments have begun, which could result in the rejection of our products by our customers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, diverted development resources, and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims, any of which could harm our business. Third parties could sustain injuries from our products, and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. We may also be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. Because we are a smaller company, a product recall would be particularly harmful to us because we have limited financial and administrative resources to effectively manage a product recall and it would detract managements attention from implementing our core business strategies. A significant product defect or product recall could materially and adversely affect our brand image, causing a decline in our sales, and could reduce or deplete our financial resources.\nCosts associated with our multi-year maintenance contract with a foreign military customer could be higher than expected.\nWe are obligated under a five-year repair and maintenance agreement with a foreign military. We have contracted with a third party service provider to administer the required services under the terms of the maintenance agreement. The revenue from the maintenance agreement with our customer is fixed and paid annually upon completion of each year through May 2024. It is possible that the cost to repair and maintain the products and the cost to contract with our third party service provider could exceed the revenue generated by the maintenance agreement.\nWe rely on outside manufacturers and suppliers to provide a large number of components and sub-assemblies incorporated in our products, and the ability of these manufacturers and suppliers to deliver components to our manufacturing facilities, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our results of operations.\nOur products are made from a wide range of materials and have a large number of components and sub-assemblies (including semiconductors and other electronic components) produced by numerous outside suppliers around the world. Because not all of our supply arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including COVID-19-related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns, transportation delays, work stoppages, labor relations, labor shortages, price inflation, governmental regulatory and enforcement actions, intellectual property claims against suppliers, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, information technology failures, and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding, or other natural disasters. For example, we expect to continue to be impacted by the following supply chain issues, due to economic, political and other factors largely beyond our control: increased input material costs and component shortages; supply chain disruptions and delays and cost inflation, all of which could continue or escalate in the future. The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels, water availability, increased cost for decarbonizing process heating, supply costs impacted by increasing energy costs, or energy costs impacted by carbon prices or offsets may exacerbate these risks. If these disruptions occur, or if we experience quality problems with suppliers, then our production schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.\nAlthough we assemble our products internally, we have some sub-assemblies and components produced by third party manufacturers. We may be required to outsource manufacturing if sales of our products increase significantly. We may be unable to obtain acceptable manufacturing sources on a timely basis. In addition, from time to time we may change manufacturers and any new manufacturer engaged by us may not perform as expected. An extended interruption in the supply of our products could result in a substantial loss of sales. Furthermore, any actual or perceived degradation of product quality as a result of our reliance on third party manufacturers may have an adverse effect on sales or result in increased warranty costs, product returns, and buybacks. Failure to maintain quality manufacturing could reduce future revenues, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial supply disruptions and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as price inflation, can also result in increased pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract.\nWe derive revenue from government contracts and subcontracts, which are often non-standard, may involve competitive bidding, may be subject to cancellation with or without penalty, and may produce volatility in earnings and revenue.\nOur sales to government customers have involved, and are expected in the future to involve, providing products and services under contracts or subcontracts with U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign government agencies. Obtaining contracts and subcontracts from government agencies is challenging, and contracts often include provisions that are not standard in private commercial transactions. For example, government contracts may:\ninclude provisions that allow the government agency to terminate the contract without penalty under some circumstances;\nbe subject to purchasing decisions of agencies that are subject to political influence;\ncontain onerous procurement procedures; and\nbe subject to cancellation if government funding becomes unavailable.\nSecuring government contracts can be a protracted process involving competitive bidding. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders may challenge contract awards, which can lead to increased costs, delays, and possible loss of the contract for the winning bidder.\nOur success is dependent on the performance of our executive team, and the cooperation, performance, and retention of our executive officers and key employees.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive team including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business. We cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us.\nWe are also dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high quality personnel, especially sales and skilled engineering personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified managerial, sales, and technical personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, sales and technical personnel could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Statements and Operating Results\nWe do not have the ability to accurately predict future operating results. Our quarterly and annual revenues are likely to fluctuate significantly due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control and could result in our failure to achieve our revenue expectations.\nWe expect our proprietary acoustic products, software products, and integrated solutions will be the source of substantially all our revenues for at least the near future. Revenues from these products and solutions are expected to vary significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue expectations. These factors include:\nour ability to develop and supply sound reproduction components to customers, distributors or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or to license our technologies;\nmarket acceptance of and changes in demand for our products or products of our customers;\ngains or losses of significant customers, distributors or strategic relationships;\nunpredictable volume and timing of customer orders;\ndelays in funding approval by U.S. and foreign government and military customers;\nthe availability, pricing, and timeliness of delivery of components for our products and OEM products;\nfluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs;\nthe timing of new technological advances, product announcements or introductions by us, by OEMs or licensees, and by our competitors;\nproduction delays by customers, distributors, OEMs, or by us or our suppliers;\nincreased competition in this market;\nthe conditions of other industries, such as military and commercial industries, into which our technologies may be sold;\ngeneral electronics industry conditions, including changes in demand and associated effects on inventory and inventory practices;\ngeneral economic conditions that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling; and\ngeneral political conditions in this country and in various other parts of the world that could affect spending for the products that we offer.\nSome or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products or technologies, and therefore adversely affect our future operating results.\nMost of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. We may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfalls, which could harm our quarterly operating results. We do not have the ability to predict future operating results with any certainty.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws, regulations and standards, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, compliance costs and enforcement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act), XBRL interactive SEC filings, new SEC regulations, and NASDAQ Stock Market rules. For example, under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain conflict minerals for issuers for which such conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that issuer. The metals covered by the rules include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, commonly referred to as 3TG. Our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes. The rules require us to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine if we know or have reason to believe any of the minerals used in the production process may have originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. If we are not able to determine the minerals did not originate from a covered country or conclude that there is no reason to believe that the minerals used in the production process may have originated in a covered country, we would be required to perform supply chain due diligence on members of our supply chain. Global supply chains can have multiple layers, thus the costs of complying with these new requirements could be substantial. These new requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Our management expects that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence in our financial reporting, our ability to obtain financing, and other aspects of our business.\nMaintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require us to include in our Form 10-K a report by management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the respective fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022, it is possible that material weaknesses will be identified in the future. In addition, components of our internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the Companys stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Stock\nSales of common stock issuable on the exercise of outstanding options, may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding options granted to our employees, consultants, advisors, and directors to purchase 3,940,899 shares of our common stock and we had 343,175 restricted stock units outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, the exercise prices for the options ranged from $1.31 to $8.03 per share. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and the release of outstanding restricted stock units could cause substantial dilution to holders of our common stock, and the sale of those shares in the market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The potential dilution from these shares could negatively affect the terms on which we could obtain equity financing.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of your common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions.\nOur stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date. In the future, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in:\nour anticipated or actual operating results;\ndevelopments concerning our software and sound reproduction technologies;\ntechnological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors;\nannouncements of merger or acquisition transactions;\nchanges in personnel within our company; and\nother events or factors and general economic and market conditions.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.

The declaration of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Companys earnings, if any, capital requirements and financial position, general economic conditions and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the near future.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the information set forth in Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNo securities were sold within the past three years that were not registered under the Securities Act and not previously reported.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn December 2022, the Board of Directors extended the Companys share buyback program through December 31, 2024. Under the program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common shares.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, 259,310 shares were repurchased for $1.0 million. There were no shares repurchased during the year ended September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, all repurchased shares were retired. As of September 30, 2022, $3.0 million was available for share repurchase under this program. Item 6. Reserved Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe discussion and analysis set forth below should be read in conjunction with the information presented in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion contains forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and industry experience, as well as our perception of historical trends, current market conditions, current economic data, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nGenasys is a global provider of critical communications hardware and software solutions designed to alert, inform, and protect people. Our unified software/hardware platform receives information from a wide variety of sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) inputs to collect real-time information on developing and active emergency situations. The Genasys critical communications platform uses this information to create and disseminate alerts, warnings, notifications, and instructions to at-risk individuals and populations through multiple channels before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats, critical events, and other crisis situations.\nOur unified critical communications platform includes:\nSoftware\nGEM Public Safety\nGEM Public Safety is an interactive, cloud-based SaaS solution that enables State, Local and Education (SLED) customers to send critical information to at-risk individuals or groups when an emergency occurs. GEM acts as both a communications input and output, receiving information from state-of-the-art sensors and emergency services, and quickly relaying notifications, alerts, and instructions to at-risk populations and first responders. GEM customers can create and send critical, verified, and secure notifications and messages using emails, voice calls, text messages, panic buttons, desktop alerts, television, social media, and more.\nGEM Enterprise\nGEM Enterprise empowers businesses and organizations to send critical communications to at-risk employees, contractors, visitors, or groups based on geographic location or team status. Operated and controlled via a single dashboard that includes two-way polling, duress buttons, field check-ins and recipient locations, GEM Enterprise solutions integrate with data sources, including active directories, human resources, visitor management, and building control systems to find and deliver safety alerts and notifications to employees, staff, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors.\nZonehaven\nZonehaven is a multipronged SaaS application that serves both first responders and the jurisdictions they protect. Emergency services agencies can prepare for natural or man-made disasters by developing evacuation plans that map routes, shelters, traffic control locations, and road closures using Zonehaven's extensive public safety resources and mapped zones. This information is easily shared with the public and reduces the time it takes to execute emergency evacuations and conduct orderly repopulations.\nNEWS\nNEWS provides multichannel public safety notifications and instructions to designated areas, groups, or agencies when a crisis occurs. The NEWS platform is cloud-based, geo-redundant, and end-to-end encrypted. NEWS is a SaaS product that requires mobile telecom services for installation and integration. Genasys partners with mobile telecom networks to provide the channels to deliver NEWS SMS and CBC alerts and notifications that can be sent to anyone, anywhere, with no recipient opt-in, registration or download required.\nHardware\nIMNS\nThe IMNS product line unites Genasys next generation of mass notification speaker systems with GEM command-and-control software. Most legacy mass notification systems sound sirens, but have limited, if any, voice broadcast capability. Genasys' advanced mass notification systems feature the industry's highest STI, large directional and omni-directional broadcast coverage areas, and an array of options that enable the systems to continue to operate when power and telecommunications infrastructure goes down.\nLRAD\nThe LRAD is the worlds leading AHD. Projecting alert tones and audible voice messages with exceptional vocal clarity in a 30\u00b0 beam from close range to 5,500 meters, LRADs are used throughout the world in multiple applications and circumstances to safely hail, warn, inform, direct, prevent misunderstandings, determine intent, establish large safety zones, resolve uncertain situations, and save lives. LRADs have been deployed on military vehicles, at corporate headquarters, in hostage negotiations, aboard private yachts, and in numerous other situations where clear and intelligible voice communications are essential.\nOur critical communications platform is being used in more than 100 countries to help safeguard millions of people in a range of diverse applications that include public safety, emergency warning, mass notification, defense, law enforcement, border and homeland security, critical infrastructure protection, and many more. We continue to develop new critical communications innovations and believe we have established significant competitive advantages in our principal markets.\nRecent Developments\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we accomplished the following:\n\u25cf\nValidated SaaS platform and business model\n\u25cf\nAccelerated momentum in software service sales\n\u25cf\nReceived multi-year enterprise SaaS contract from a second global automaker\n\u25cf\nLanded new SaaS contracts in the Utility sector\n\u25cf\nCaptured 10 cross-selling opportunities\n\u25cf\nExpanded geographic reach in 19 new U.S. states\n\u25cf\nSignificantly increased the number of customers for Genasys comprehensive suite of public safety, emergency warning, and evacuation solutions\n\u25cf\nAnnounced GEM government and enterprise software contracts and expanded GEM and Zonheaven software services in multiple cities, counties, and states\n\u25cf\nAwarded NEWS contract to power Slovenias nationwide public warning system\n\u25cf\nGrew hardware sales by 15% due to a 457% increase in Integrated Mass Notification System revenue\n\u25cf\nReceived $15.7 million LRAD order from the U.S. Army under AHD Program of Record\n\u25cf\nAnnounced GEM government and enterprise software contracts and expanded GEM and Zonehaven software services in multiple cities, counties, and states\n\u25cf\nAwarded NEWS contract to power Slovenias nationwide public warning system\n\u25cf\nAnnounced next generation IMNS installations in Japan and with the U.S. Army order\n\u25cf\nReceived and shipped orders for the new LRAD 950NXT, the Companys next generation remotely operated long-range communications system\nBusiness Outlook\nOur products, systems, and solutions continue to gain worldwide awareness and recognition through media exposure, product demonstrations, and word of mouth as a result of positive responses and increased acceptance. We believe we have a solid global brand, technology, and product foundation, which we continue to expand to serve new markets and customers for greater business growth. We believe we have strong market opportunities for our product offerings throughout the world in the defense, public safety, emergency warning, mass notification, critical event management, and law enforcement sectors as a result of increasing threats to government, commerce, law enforcement, homeland security, and critical infrastructure. Our products, systems, and solutions also have many applications within the fire rescue, maritime, asset protection, and wildlife control and preservation business segments.\nGenasys has developed a global market and an increased demand for LRADs and advanced mass notification speakers. We have a reputation for producing quality products that feature industry-leading broadcast area coverage, vocal intelligibility, and product reliability. We intend to continue building on our AHD market leadership position by offering enhanced voice broadcast systems and accessories for an expanding range of applications. In executing our strategy, we use direct sales to governments, militaries, large end-users, system integrators, and prime vendors. We have built a worldwide distribution channel consisting of partners and resellers that have significant expertise and experience selling integrated communication solutions into our various target markets. As our primary AHD sales opportunities are with domestic and international governments, military branches, and law enforcement agencies, we are subject to each customers unique budget cycle, which leads to long selling cycles and uneven revenue flow, complicating our product planning.\nThe proliferation of natural and man-made disasters, emergency events, and civil unrest require technologically advanced, multi-channel solutions to deliver clear and timely critical communications to help keep people safe during crisis situations. Businesses are also incorporating critical communication and emergency management systems that locate and help safeguard employees when crises occur.\nBy providing the only SaaS platform that unifies sensors and IoT inputs with multichannel, multiagency alerting and notifications, Genasys seeks to deliver reliable, fast, and intuitive solutions for creating and disseminating geolocation-targeted warnings, information, and instructions before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats.\nWhile the software and hardware mass notification markets are more mature with many established manufacturers and suppliers, we believe that our advanced technology and unified platform provides opportunities to succeed in the large and growing public safety, emergency warning and critical communications markets.\nIn fiscal 2023, we intend to continue pursuing domestic and international business opportunities with the support of business development consultants, key representatives, and resellers. We plan to grow our revenues through increased direct sales to governments and agencies that desire to integrate our communication technologies into their homeland security and public safety systems. This includes building on fiscal 2022 domestic defense sales by pursuing further U.S. military opportunities. We also plan to pursue emergency warning, enterprise and critical event management, government, law enforcement, fire rescue, homeland and international security, private and commercial security, border security, maritime security, and wildlife preservation and control business opportunities. In addition to the matters above, we are authorized for the performance of services and provision of goods pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law.\nOur research and development strategy involves incorporating further innovations and capabilities into our GEM, Zonehaven, NEWS, IMNS and LRAD products, systems, and solutions to meet the needs of our target markets.\nOur GEM, Zonehaven, and NEWS software solutions are more complex offerings. We are pursuing certain certifications, which are often required when bidding on government and mass notification opportunities. We intend to invest engineering resources to enhance our GEM, Zonehaven, and NEWS software solutions to compete for larger emergency warning and critical communications business opportunities. We are also configuring alternative solutions to achieve lower price points to meet the needs of certain customers or applications. We also engage in ongoing value engineering to reduce the cost and simplify the manufacturing of our products.\nA large number of components and sub-assemblies manufactured by outside suppliers within our supply chain are produced within 50 miles of our facility. We do not source component parts from suppliers in China. It is likely that some of our suppliers source parts in China. The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact worldwide supply chains and the ability to obtain sufficient amounts of component parts, including semiconductor chips and integrated circuits, resins, coating and other equipment and components. Negative impacts on our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business. We communicate with our suppliers regarding measures to alleviate ongoing worldwide supply chain issues.\nWe have been affected by price increases from our suppliers and logistics as well as other inflationary factors such as increased salary, labor, and overhead costs. We regularly review and adjust the sales price of our finished goods to offset these inflationary factors. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial results through September 30, 2022, sustained or increased inflation in the future may have a negative effect on our ability to achieve certain expectations in gross margin and operating expenses. If we are unable to offset the negative impacts of inflation with increased prices, our future results could be materially affected.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to understanding our results of operations. Our accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements and related notes located in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and throughout Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nAccounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), outlines a, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized:\n1.\nIdentify the contract(s) with customers\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligations\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n5.\nRecognize revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied\nASC 606 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe derive our revenue from the sale of products and services to customers, contracts, license fees, other services, and freight. The Company sells its products and services through its direct sales force and through authorized resellers and system integrators. The Company recognizes revenue for goods, including software, when all the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the customer, no continuing managerial involvement usually associated with ownership of the goods is retained, no effective control over the goods sold is retained, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to the Company, and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Software license revenue, maintenance and/or software development service fees may be bundled in one arrangement or may be sold separately.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is recognized as a distinct single performance obligation when products are tendered to a carrier for delivery, which represents the point in time that our customer obtains control of the products. A smaller portion of product revenue is recognized when the customer receives delivery of the products. A portion of products are sold through resellers and system integrators based on firm commitments from an end user, and as a result, resellers and system integrators carry little or no inventory. Our customers do not have a right to return product unless the product is found defective and therefore our estimate for returns has historically been insignificant\nPerpetual licensed software\nThe sale and/or license of software products is deemed to have occurred when a customer either has taken possession of, or has the ability to take immediate possession of, the software and the software key. Perpetual software licenses can include one-year maintenance and support services. In addition, the Company sells maintenance services on a stand-alone basis and is therefore capable of determining their fair value. On this basis, the amount of the embedded maintenance is separated from the fee for the perpetual license and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period to which the maintenance relates.\nTime-based licensed software\nThe time-based license agreements include the use of a software license for a fixed term, generally one-year, and maintenance and support services during the same period. The Company does not sell time-based licenses without maintenance and support services and therefore revenues for the entire arrangements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term.\nWarranty, maintenance, and services\nWe offer extended warranty, maintenance and other services. Extended warranty and maintenance contracts are offered with terms ranging from one to several years, which provide repair and maintenance services after expiration of the original one-year warranty term. Revenues from separately priced extended warranty contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the warranty period and maintenance contracts are recognized based on time elapsed over the service period. Revenue from other services such as training or installation is recognized when the service is completed. Warranty, maintenance and services are classified as contract and other revenues.\nMultiple element arrangements\nThe Company has entered into a number of multiple element arrangements, such as when selling a product or perpetual licenses that may include maintenance and support (included in the price of the perpetual licenses) and time-based licenses (that include embedded maintenance and support, both of which may be sold with software development services, training, and other product sales). In some cases, the Company delivers software development services bundled with the sale of the software. In multiple element arrangements, the Company uses either the stand-alone selling price or an expected cost plus margin approach to determine the fair value of each element within the arrangement, including software and software-related services such as maintenance and support. In general, elements in such arrangements are also sold on a stand-alone basis and stand-alone selling prices are available.\nRevenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the fair value of each individual element and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met, except for time-based licenses, which are not unbundled. When software development services are performed to customize the functionality of the software, the Company recognizes revenue from the software development services on a stage of completion basis, and the revenue from the software when the related development services have been completed.\nWe currently disaggregate revenue by reporting segment (Hardware and Software) and geographically to depict the nature of revenue in a manner consistent with our business operations and to be consistent with other communications and public filings. Refer to Note 18, Segment Information and Note 19, Major Customers, Suppliers and Related Information for additional details of revenues by reporting segment and disaggregation of revenue.\nShare-Based Compensation. We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718) which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, consultants and directors based on estimated fair values. ASC 718 requires the use of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated term of each award. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. This model also utilizes the fair value of our common stock and requires that, at the date of grant, we use the expected term of the share-based award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield of our common stock to determine the estimated fair value. We determine the amount of share-based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest, reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts. Our products are sold to customers in many different markets and geographic locations. We estimate our bad debt reserve on a case-by-case basis due to a limited number of customers. We base these estimates on many factors, including customer credit worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. Our judgments and estimates regarding collectability of accounts receivable have an impact on our financial statements.\nValuation of Inventory. Our inventory is comprised of raw materials, assemblies and finished products. We must periodically make judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of our inventory. The carrying value of our inventory is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected future benefit from our inventory is less than its carrying value.\nValuation of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist of technology, customer relationships, trade name portfolio, and non-compete agreements acquired in the acquisitions of Genasys Spain and Zonehaven and the Amika Mobile asset purchase and patents and trademarks that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We must make judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of intangible assets. The carrying values of such assets are periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected future benefit to be derived from an individual intangible asset is less than its carrying value. This generally occurs when certain assets are no longer consistent with our business strategy and whose expected future value has decreased.\nValuation of Goodwill. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a single reporting unit below the carrying amount. We assess qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. The qualitative factors evaluated by management include: macro-economic conditions of the local business environment, overall financial performance, and other entity specific factors as deemed appropriate. If, through this qualitative assessment, the conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than the carrying amount, a two-step impairment test is performed. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the reporting units carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nDerivatives. We use derivative financial instruments to manage risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold derivative financial instruments of a speculative nature or for trading purposes. We record all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value using available market information and other observable data. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for further discussion.\nAccrued Expenses. We establish a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenue is recognized. This reserve requires us to make estimates regarding the amount and costs of warranty repairs we expect to make over a period of time. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels include the number of units sold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs, and anticipated rates of warranty claims. Warranty expense is recorded in cost of revenues. We evaluate the adequacy of this reserve each reporting period.\nWe use the recognition criteria of ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies to estimate the bonus amount when it becomes probable a bonus liability will be incurred and we recognize expense ratably over the service period. We accrue bonus expense each quarter based on estimated year-end results, and then adjust the actual in the fourth quarter based on our final results compared to targets.\nDeferred Tax Asset. We evaluate quarterly the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards. Utilization of the net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in future years could be substantially limited due to restrictions imposed under federal and state laws upon a change in ownership or control. Included in the NOL carryforwards are deductions from stock options that, if recognized, will be recorded as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than through our results of operations. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the ability to recover deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the ability to realize its net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize deferred tax assets and will adjust the valuation accordingly.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew pronouncements issued for future implementation are discussed in Note 3, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to our consolidated financial statements.\nSegment and Related Information\nWe are engaged in the design, development, and commercialization of critical communications hardware and software solutions designed to alert, inform and protect people. The Company operates in two business segments: Hardware and Software and its principal markets are North and South America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. As reviewed by the Companys chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on sales and operating income. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, deferred tax assets, goodwill, and intangible assets are primary assets identified by segment. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole and transactions between the two operating segments are eliminated in consolidation. Refer to Note 18, Segment Information, in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nComparison of Results of Operations for Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nThe following table provides for the periods indicated certain items of our consolidated statements of operations expressed in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales. The financial information and discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in this Annual Report.\nYears ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\n% of\n% of\nTotal\nTotal\nFav(Unfav)\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nRevenues:\nProduct sales\n$ 48,637\n90.0 %\n$ 41,602\n88.5 %\n$ 7,035\n16.9 %\nContract and other\n5,398\n10.0 %\n5,401\n11.5 %\n(3 )\n(0.1 %)\nTotal revenues\n54,035\n100.0 %\n47,003\n100.0 %\n7,032\n15.0 %\nCost of revenues\n27,693\n51.3 %\n23,577\n50.2 %\n(4,116 )\n(17.5 %)\nGross Profit\n26,342\n48.7 %\n23,426\n49.8 %\n2,916\n12.4 %\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative\n21,688\n40.1 %\n17,424\n37.1 %\n(4,264 )\n(24.5 %)\nGoodwill impairment\n13,162\n24.4 %\n-\n0.0 %\n(13,162 )\n(100.0 %)\nResearch and development\n7,023\n13.0 %\n4,918\n10.5 %\n(2,105 )\n(42.8 %)\nTotal operating expenses\n41,873\n77.5 %\n22,342\n47.5 %\n(19,531 )\n(87.4 %)\n(Loss) income from operations\n(15,531 )\n(28.7 %)\n1,084\n2.3 %\n(16,615 )\n(1532.7 %)\nOther income, net\n0.1 %\n0.1 %\n11.1 %\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n(15,471 )\n(28.6 %)\n1,138\n2.4 %\n(16,609 )\n(1459.5 %)\nIncome tax expense\n1.4 %\n0.9 %\n(307 )\n(70.7 %)\nNet loss\n$ (16,212 )\n(30.0 %)\n$\n1.5 %\n$ (16,916 )\n(2402.8 %)\nNet revenues\nHardware\n$ 50,938\n94.3 %\n$ 44,233\n94.1 %\n6,705\n15.2 %\nSoftware\n3,097\n5.7 %\n2,770\n5.9 %\n11.8 %\nTotal net revenues\n$ 54,035\n100.0 %\n$ 47,003\n100.0 %\n$ 7,032\n15.0 %\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $7.0 million, or 15%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Current fiscal year AHD revenue was $39.5 million, IMNS revenue was $11.4 million, and software revenue was $3.1 million. This represented increases of $9.4 million, or 457%, for IMNS and $0.3 million, or 11%, for software, offset by a decrease of $2.7, or 6%, for AHD revenue compared with the prior year. The receipt of orders is often uneven due to the timing of government budgets or approvals. The increase in software revenue in this fiscal year is largely due to growth in SaaS revenue, partially offset by lower professional services revenue on new software contracts. As of September 30, 2022, we had aggregate deferred revenue and prepayments from customers in advance of product shipment of $6.8 million. The receipt of orders will often be uneven due to the timing of customers approval or budget cycles.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended September 30, 2022, increased $2.9 million or 12.4% compared to fiscal year 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales volume, offset by increased costs associated with continued investment in personnel to support the growth of our software products and higher product costs in the second half of fiscal year 2022. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was 48.7% this year, compared to 49.8% in the prior year.\nOur products have varying gross margins, so product mix may affect gross profits. In addition, our margins vary based on the sales channels through which our products are sold in a given period. We continue to implement product updates and changes, including raw material and component changes that may impact product costs. With such product updates and changes we have limited warranty cost experience and estimated future warranty costs can impact our gross margins. We do not believe that historical gross profit margins should be relied upon as an indicator of future gross profit margins.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.3 million, or 24.5%. The increase was primarily due to $1.9 million of additional employee related costs, largely associated with our 13% increase in sales and administration personnel over the prior year to support software revenue growth opportunities. In addition, amortization expense increased $1.0 million, and marketing related, and travel expenses increased $1.2 million over the prior year.\nWe incurred non-cash share-based compensation expenses allocated to selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 and 2021 of $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nWe may expend additional resources on the marketing and selling of our products in future periods as we identify ways to optimize potential business opportunities. Commission expense will fluctuate based on the nature of our sales.\nGoodwill Impairment\nAs a result of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we recognized a $13.2 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our Software segment for the year ended September 30, 2022. For more information, refer to Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses increased by $2.1 million, or 42.8%, primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in employee-related costs associated with our growth in staffing from 79 to 96.\nIncluded in R&D expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $70 thousand of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, compared to $40 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, increased by $6 thousand due to changes in interest income and realized gains and losses on foreign currency translation.\nNet (Loss) Income\nThe net loss of $16.2 million for fiscal 2022 was a decrease of $16.9 million compared to fiscal year 2021. This was primarily due to a $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Pretax income in fiscal year 2022 was $16.9 million less than the prior year primarily due to a $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge and $3.5 million increase in operating expenses. Income tax expense increased in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to a $1.0 million non-cash charge related to a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. For additional details, refer to Note 13, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Metrics\nWe monitor a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our other business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar other business metrics used by other companies (in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents our net income before other income, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The items that are non-cash include depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding allocation of capital, and invest in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Nevertheless, use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the intangible assets that are amortized and property and equipment that is depreciated, will need to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacement or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (4) adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments or receipts that may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us; and (5) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of the metric as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside our other U.S. GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income, and our other U.S. GAAP financial results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYears ended\nSeptember 30,\nNet (loss) income\n$ (16,212 )\n$\nOther income, net\n(60 )\n(54 )\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\nDepreciation and amortization\n2,556\n1,597\nImpairment of goodwill\n13,162\n-\nStock-based compensation\n2,227\n1,424\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 2,414\n$ 4,105\nSegment Results\nSegment results include net sales and operating income by segment.

This reflects a 427.3% increase in recurring revenue in the Americas offset by a 41.8% decrease in professional services and licensing revenue compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOperating loss increased $18.0 million in the current fiscal year due to a $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge, $1.0 million in additional intangible asset amortization, the inclusion of a full year of Zonehaven operations, and increases in payroll and benefits costs due to increased hiring to support software development and sales.\nHardware Segment\nHardware segment revenue increased $6.7 million, or 15.2%, over the prior year. The increase was largely due to the higher backlog at the start of this fiscal year compared to the prior year amount.\nOperating income increased $1.4 million in the current fiscal year due to higher revenue and lower professional services expenses offset by higher non-cash compensation, higher computer related expenses and increased travel expenses\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 were $12.7 million, compared with $13.2 million as of September 30, 2021. In addition, we had $6.4 million in short-term marketable securities as of September 30, 2022, compared with $5.7 million as of September 30, 2021, and long-term marketable securities of $0.8 million and $1.9 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also had restricted cash of $0.9 million as of September 30, 2022 and $1.4 million as of September 30, 2021. In addition, we have a $10 million line of credit with MUFG Bank. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances against the line of credit. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants and as of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Other than cash and expected future cash flows from operating activities in subsequent periods and the line of credit, we have no other unused sources of liquidity at this time.\nPrincipal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:\nability to meet sales projections;\ngovernment spending levels;\nintroduction of competing technologies;\nproduct mix and effect on margins;\nability to reduce and manage inventory levels; and\nproduct acceptance in new markets.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:\nvolatility in the capital markets; and\nmarket price and trading volume of our common stock.\nIn December 2018, the Board of Directors approved a share buyback program beginning January 1, 2019, under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common shares. In December 2020, the Board of Directors extended the buyback program until December 31, 2022. Based on our current cash position, our order backlog, and assuming the accuracy of our currently planned expenditures, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund planned levels of operations for at least the next twelve months. However, we operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we may not be required to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities. Additional capital, if needed, may not be available on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the table below (in thousands):\nYears ended\nSeptember 30,\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n$ 6,150\nInvesting activities\n(89 )\n(15,554 )\nFinancing activities\n(1,063 )\nOperating Activities\nNet loss of $16.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, included a $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge and $6.7 million of other non-cash items including share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, operating right of use lease amortization, depreciation and amortization, inventory obsolescence, and a provision for warranty. Cash provided by operating activities reflected a $0.2 million increase in accounts payable and a $4.6 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, which included customer deposits, accrued payroll, deferred revenue, and operating lease liabilities. This was partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other, which includes deposits paid on inventory purchases, prepaid rent and prepaid insurance, and a $0.8 million decrease in accounts receivable.\nNet income of $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, included $4.6 million of non-cash items including share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, operating right of use lease amortization, unrealized loss on a foreign currency forward contract, depreciation and amortization, inventory obsolescence, and a provision for warranty. Cash provided by operating activities reflected a $0.6 million increase in accounts payable and a $4.9 million increase in accrued and other liabilities, which included customer deposits, accrued payroll, deferred revenue, and operating lease liabilities. This was partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other, which includes deposits paid on inventory purchases, prepaid rent and prepaid insurance, a $2.1 million increase in accounts receivable that resulted from higher current year fiscal fourth quarter shipments, and a $0.8 million increase in inventory.\nWe had accounts receivable of $6.7 million and $7.7 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Terms with individual customers vary greatly. We often offer net thirty-day terms to our customers. Our receivables can vary dramatically due to overall sales volume and quarterly variations in sales and timing of shipments to and receipts from large customers.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our working capital was $20.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively. The increase in working capital was largely the result of a decrease in customer deposits of $3.9 million offset by a $0.8 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $0.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we used $6.8 million of cash to purchase short and long-term marketable securities, compared with using $5.1 million to purchase short and long-term marketable securities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we had proceeds from maturities of available for sale marketable securities of $7.1 million, compared with $5.6 million in fiscal year 2021.\nIn the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we used $15.8 million in cash to complete the Amika Mobile asset purchase and Zonehaven acquisition in the first and third quarters of fiscal year 2021.\nWe also used cash in investing activities for the purchase of product tooling, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements for our operating facilities. Cash used for capital expenditures was $0.4 million and $0.2 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate additional expenditures for capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023 as we continue to invest in new products and technologies.\nFinancing Activities\nIn the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nIn December 2018, the Board of Directors approved a share buyback program beginning January 1, 2019 and expiring on December 31, 2020, under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common shares. In December 2020, the Board of Directors extended the buyback program until December 31, 2022. The previous program expired on December 31, 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, 259,310 shares were repurchased for $1.0 million. There were no shares repurchased during the year ended September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, all repurchased shares were retired. As of September 30, 2022, $3.0 million was available for share repurchase under this program.\nCommitments\nWe are committed for our facility lease through August 30, 2028, as more fully described in Note 12, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has a bonus plan for employees, in accordance with their terms of employment, whereby they can earn a percentage of their salary based on meeting targeted objectives for orders received, revenue, operating income, and operating cash flow. All of the Companys key employees are entitled to participate in the bonus plan. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $1.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in bonus expense, and related payroll tax expense in connection with the bonus plans. Bonus related expense is included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company is party to an employment agreement with our chief executive officer that provides for severance benefits, including twelve months salary and health benefits, a pro-rata share of his annual cash bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs to which he would have become entitled had he remained employed through the end of the fiscal year, and vesting of a portion of stock options held by at the time of termination. The agreement also has a change in control clause whereby the chief executive officer would be entitled to receive specific severance and equity vesting benefits if specified termination events occur.\nThere were no other employment agreements with executive officers or other employees providing future benefits or severance arrangements. Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nInformation requested by this Item is not included as we are electing scaled disclosure requirements available to Smaller Reporting Companies. Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe financial statements required by this item begin on page with the index to financial statements followed by the consolidated financial statements. Item 9.\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no disagreements or any reportable events requiring disclosure under Item 304(b) of Regulation S-K. Item 9A.\nControls and Procedures.\nWe are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information related to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act Reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act Reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022 and, based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the guidelines established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to rules of the SEC, such attestation is not required for smaller reporting companies, which permit the Company to provide only managements report in this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting since September 30, 2021, in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Goodwill for the software reporting unit\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company determined that the software reporting units goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment loss of approximately $13.2 million. As a result, the Company's remaining consolidated goodwill balance was $10.1 million as of the year ended September 30, 2022.\nManagement's estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using the guideline public company method and guideline merged and acquired company method, both of which are forms of the market approach.\nThe determination of fair value using these techniques includes assumptions about sales growth and valuation multiples which consider marketplace data.\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the software reporting unit as a critical audit matter due to: (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurements of the reporting unit, (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to managements anticipated future cash flows and significant assumptions related to sales growth and valuation multiples, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u25a0\nObtaining an understanding and evaluating the design and implementation of the Company's controls over the goodwill impairment assessment process.\n\u25a0\nReviewing management's goodwill impairment analysis memorandum including the fair value of reporting unit.\n\u25a0\nEvaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable by considering the past performance of the reporting units and third-party market data, and whether such assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\u25a0\nComparing the actual results to those historically forecasted by the Company.\n\u25a0\nUtilizing an auditor-engaged valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the valuation methodologies used by the Company for the goodwill impairment assessment by comparing the methodologies to those utilized by other companies holding similar assets, and to compare management's assumption inputs to information from external sources and available economic forecasts and data.\n/s/ BAKER TILLY US, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nSan Diego, California\nDecember 16, 2022\nGenasys Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in

except per share and share amounts)\n1. OPERATIONS\nGenasys Inc. is a global provider of critical communications hardware and software solutions designed to alert, inform, and protect people. The Company's unified platform receives information from a wide variety of sensors and Internet-of-Things (IoT) inputs to collect real-time information on developing and active emergency situations. The Company uses this information to create and disseminate alerts, warnings, notifications, and instructions through multiple channels before, during, and after public safety and enterprise threats, critical events, and other crisis situations.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe Company has eight wholly owned subsidiaries, Genasys II Spain, S.A.U. (Genasys Spain), Genasys Communications Canada ULC (Genasys Canada), Genasys Singapore PTE Ltd, Genasys Puerto Rico, LLC, Zonehaven LLC, and Genasys Inc. (branch) in the United Arab Emirates and two currently inactive subsidiaries, Genasys America de CV and LRAD International Corporation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of these subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions (e.g., share-based compensation valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, intangible assets and goodwill, warranty reserve, valuation of operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities, accrued bonus and valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nThe Company sells its products to a large number of geographically diverse customers. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. It is customary for the Company to require a deposit as collateral. As of September 30, 2022, accounts receivable from two customers accounted for 43% and 19% of total accounts receivable with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance. As of September 30, 2021, accounts receivable from two customers accounted for 66% and 18% of total accounts receivable with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance.\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by depositing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company also invests cash in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in the Companys policy guidelines such as money market funds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and Certificates of Deposit. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument. It is generally the Companys policy to invest in instruments that have a final maturity of no longer than three years, with a portfolio weighted average maturity of no longer than 18 months.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount of cash and cash equivalents was $12,736 and $13,167, respectively.\nThe Company considers any amounts pledged as collateral or otherwise restricted for use in current operations to be restricted cash. In addition, the Company excludes from cash and cash equivalents cash required to fund specific future contractual obligations related to business combinations. Restricted cash is classified as a current asset unless amounts are not expected to be released and available for use in operations within one year. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount of restricted cash was $923 and $1,361, respectively, which is included in Restricted cash and Long-term restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet.\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES\nThe Company accounts for investments in debt instruments as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The realized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nThe Company carries accounts receivable at historical cost, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses considering the following factors when determining if collection of a receivable is probable: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience with the customer, the Company may obtain reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying creditors. The Company may also request financial information to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate collection is probable, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. There was no deferred revenue as of September 30, 2022 or 2021 as a result of collection issues. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. The Company determines allowances on a customer specific basis. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $181 and $127, respectively.\nCONTRACT MANUFACTURERS\nThe Company employs contract manufacturers for production of certain components and sub-assemblies. The Company may provide parts and components to such parties from time to time but recognizes no revenue or markup on such transactions. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the Company performed assembly of products in-house using components and sub-assemblies from a variety of contract manufacturers and suppliers.\nINVENTORIES\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a standard cost system whereby differences between the standard cost and purchase price are recorded as a purchase price variance in cost of revenues. Inventory is comprised of raw materials, assemblies and finished products intended for sale. The Company periodically makes judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of inventory. The carrying value of inventory is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected net realizable value is less than carrying value. The Company has inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory, which is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company increased its inventory reserve by $105 during the year ended September 30, 2022 for parts and demo equipment that may not be utilized. The Company increased its inventory reserve by $183 during the year ended September 30, 2021 for parts and demo equipment that may not be utilized.\nEQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\nEquipment is stated at cost. Depreciation on machinery and equipment and office furniture and equipment is computed over the estimated useful lives of two to seven years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease. Upon retirement or disposition of equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which the Company may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting the Company recognizes separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed generally at the acquisition date fair value. The Company measures goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which the Company also measures at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that the Company incurs to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and the Company charges them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if the Company identifies changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and the Company records the offset to goodwill. The Company records all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIdentifiable intangible assets, which consist of technology, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents, tradenames and trademarks, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, based on a number of assumptions including estimated periodic economic benefit and utilization. The estimated useful lives of identifiable intangible assets have been estimated to be between three and fifteen years. The carrying value of intangibles is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the carrying value exceeds fair value.\nGoodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a single reporting unit below the carrying amount. The Company assesses qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. The qualitative factors evaluated by the Company include: macro-economic conditions of the business environment, overall financial performance, and other entity specific factors as deemed appropriate. If, through this qualitative assessment, the conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount, a two-step impairment test is performed. For reporting units where the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the reporting units carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, in conjunction with the annual impairment assessment, the Company recorded a $13,162 goodwill impairment charge associated with the software reporting unit. Refer to Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for more information.\nLEASES\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842) in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2019. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 842, the Company recognizes lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use-assets for all leases with terms of greater than 12 months. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for in a manner similar to the guidance for operating leases prior to the adoption of ASC 842. Refer to Note 12, Leases for more information.\nSHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS\nShipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenues. Shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are included in revenue. Actual shipping and handling costs were $640 and $232 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Actual revenues from shipping and handling were $836 and $266 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nADVERTISING\nAdvertising costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $677 and $193 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nWARRANTY RESERVES\nThe Company warrants its products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of purchase. The warranty is generally limited. The Company currently provides direct warranty service. Some agreements with OEM customers, from time to time, may require that certain quantities of product be made available for use as warranty replacements. International market warranties are generally similar to the U.S. market. The Company also sells extended warranty contracts and maintenance agreements.\nThe Company establishes a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenues are recognized. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels include the number of units sold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs and anticipated rates of warranty claims. The Company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for warranty costs each reporting period. The warranty reserve was $159 and $146 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company determines its income tax provision using the asset and liability method. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. A valuation allowance is recorded by the Company to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the ability to realize the Companys deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income and the tax rates in effect at that time. Additional information regarding income taxes appears in Note 13, Income Taxes.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles held for use are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the fair value, or if changes in facts and circumstances indicate impairment, an impairment loss is measured and recognized using the assets fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 5, Fair Value Measurements and Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company is a global provider of critical communications hardware and software solutions designed to alert, inform, and protect people. The Company operates in two business segments: Hardware and Software and its principal markets are North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. As reviewed by the Companys chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on sales and operating income. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets are primary assets identified by segment. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole and transactions between the two operating segments are eliminated in consolidation. Refer to Note 18, Segment Information, for additional information.\nNET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could occur if outstanding securities convertible into common stock were exercised or converted. Refer to Note 17, Net (Loss) Income Per Share, for additional information.\nDERIVATIVES\nThe Company does not hold derivative financial instruments of a speculative nature or for trading purposes. The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value using available market information and other observable data. See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nThe Companys reporting currency is U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of Genasys Spain is the Euro and the function currency of Genasys Canada is the Canadian dollar. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of Genasys Spain and Genasys Canada at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The Company translates the revenue, costs and expenses of Genasys Spain and Genasys Canada at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The Company includes translation gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of the Companys consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Transactions undertaken in other currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction date and any exchange gains and losses resulting from these transactions, are included in the consolidated statements of operations. The translation loss for the period was $704 resulting from transactions between Genasys U.S. and Genasys Spain and Genasys Canada, the timing of transactions in relation to changes in exchange rates and the fluctuation in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. For the year ended September 30, 2021, there was a translation gain of $260.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company recognized share-based compensation expense related to qualified and non-qualified stock options issued to employees, directors and consultants over the expected vesting term of the stock-based instrument based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates or if the Company updates its estimated forfeiture rate. Refer to Note 15, Share-based Compensation, for additional information.\nRECLASSIFICATIONS\nWhere necessary, the prior years information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2022 statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or accumulated deficit.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement evaluated events subsequent to September 30, 2022, through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and noted that there were no events or transactions which would affect the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNew pronouncements pending adoption\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which supersedes current guidance by requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. The new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets including trade and other receivables at each reporting date. The new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842), which extends the effective date of Topic 326 for certain companies until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year beginning October 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not completed its review of the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. However, based on the Companys history of immaterial credit losses from trade receivables, management does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU No. 2020-04 provides optional guidance, expedients and exceptions for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in this update apply to all entities, subject to meeting the criteria, which participate in contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU No. 2020-04 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Scope, which refines the scope of Topic 848 and permits optional expedients and exceptions when accounting for derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships. The amendments of these updates are available to all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n4. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized:\n1.\nIdentify the contract(s) with customers\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligations\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n5.\nRecognize revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied\nASC 606 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company derives its revenue from the sale of products to customers, contracts, software license fees, other services and freight. The Company sells its products through its direct sales force and through authorized resellers and system integrators. The Company recognizes revenue for goods including software when all the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the customer, no continuing managerial involvement usually associated with ownership of the goods is retained, no effective control over the goods sold is retained, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to the Company and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. Software license revenue, maintenance and/or software development service fees may be bundled in one arrangement or may be sold separately.\nProduct revenue\nProduct revenue is recognized as a distinct single performance obligation when products are tendered to a carrier for delivery, which represents the point in time that the Companys customer obtains control of the products. A smaller portion of product revenue is recognized when the customer receives delivery of the products. A portion of products are sold through resellers and system integrators based on firm commitments from an end user, and as a result, resellers and system integrators carry little or no inventory. The Companys customers do not have a right to return product unless the product is found defective and therefore the Companys estimate for returns has historically been insignificant\nPerpetual licensed software\nThe sale and/or license of software products is deemed to have occurred when a customer either has taken possession of, or has the ability to take immediate possession of, the software and the software key. Perpetual software licenses can include one-year maintenance and support services. In addition, the Company sells maintenance services on a stand-alone basis and is therefore capable of determining their fair value. On this basis, the amount of the embedded maintenance is separated from the fee for the perpetual license and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period to which the maintenance relates.\nTime-based licensed software\nThe time-based license agreements include the use of a software license for a fixed term, generally one-year, and maintenance and support services during the same period. The Company does not sell time-based licenses without maintenance and support services and therefore revenues for the entire arrangements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term.\nWarranty, maintenance and services\nThe Company offers extended warranty, maintenance and other services. Extended warranty and maintenance contracts are offered with terms ranging from one to several years, which provide repair and maintenance services after expiration of the original one-year warranty term. Revenues from separately priced extended warranty and maintenance contracts are recognized based on time elapsed over the service period and classified as contract and other revenues. Revenue from other services such as training or installation is recognized when the service is completed.\nMultiple element arrangements\nThe Company has entered into a number of multiple element arrangements, such as the sale of a product or perpetual licenses that may include maintenance and support (included in price of perpetual licenses) and time-based licenses (that include embedded maintenance and support, both of which may be sold with software development services, training, and other product sales). In some cases, the Company delivers software development services bundled with the sale of the software. In multiple element arrangements, the Company uses either the stand-alone selling price or an expected cost plus margin approach to determine the fair value of each element within the arrangement, including software and software-related services such as maintenance and support. In general, elements in such arrangements are also sold on a stand-alone basis and stand-alone selling prices are available.\nRevenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the fair value of each individual element and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria described above are met, except for time-based licenses which are not unbundled. When software development services are performed and are considered essential to the functionality of the software, the Company recognizes revenue from the software development services on a stage of completion basis, and the revenue from the software when the related development services have been completed.\nThe Company disaggregates revenue by reporting segment (Hardware and Software) and geographically to depict the nature of revenue in a manner consistent with its business operations and to be consistent with other communications and public filings. Refer to Note 18, Segment Information and Note 19, Major Customers, Suppliers and Related Information for additional details of revenues by reporting segment and disaggregation of revenue.\nContract assets and liabilities\nThe Company enters into contracts to sell products and provide services and recognizes contract assets and liabilities that arise from these transactions. The Company recognizes revenue and corresponding accounts receivable according to ASC 606 and, at times, recognizes revenue in advance of the time when contracts give the Company the right to invoice a customer. Sales commissions are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Subscription related commission costs are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit. The Company may also receive consideration, per terms of a contract, from customers prior to transferring goods to the customer. The Company records customer deposits as a contract liability. Additionally, the Company may receive payments, most typically for service and warranty contracts, at the onset of the contract and before the services have been performed. In such instances, a deferred revenue liability is recorded. The Company recognizes these contract liabilities as revenue after all revenue recognition criteria are met. The table below reflects the balances of contract liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, including the change between the periods. There were no contract assets as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. The current portion of contract liabilities and the noncurrent portion are included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 10, Accrued and Other Liabilities for additional details.\nThe Companys contract liabilities were as follows:\nCustomer\ndeposits\nDeferred\nrevenue\nTotal\ncontract\nliabilities\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$ 8,701\n$ 1,428\n$ 10,129\nNew performance obligations\n14,394\n2,832\n17,226\nRecognition of revenue as a result of satisfying performance obligations\n(18,371 )\n(2,179 )\n(20,550 )\nEffect of exchange rate on deferred revenue\n-\n(27 )\n(27 )\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$ 4,724\n$ 2,054\n$ 6,778\nLess: non-current portion\n-\n(227 )\n(227 )\nCurrent portion as of September 30, 2022\n$ 4,724\n$ 1,827\n$ 6,551\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations related to ASC 606 represent the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations under an original contract with a term greater than one year which are fully or partially unsatisfied at the end of the period.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $6,778. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $6,551, or 97%, of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, and the remainder is expected to be recognized thereafter.\nPractical Expedients\nIn cases where the Company is responsible for shipping after the customer has obtained control of the goods, the Company has elected to treat these activities as fulfillment activities rather than as a separate performance obligation. Additionally, the Company has elected to capitalize the cost to obtain a contract only if the period of amortization would be longer than one year. The Company only gives consideration to whether a customer agreement has a financing component if the period of time between transfer of goods and services and customer payment is greater than one year. The Company also utilizes the as invoiced practical expedient in certain cases where performance obligations are satisfied over time and the invoiced amount corresponds directly with the value provided to the customer.\n5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Companys financial instruments consist principally of cash equivalents, short and long-term marketable securities, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether or not the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is prioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\nLevel 1:\nInputs are based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel 2:\nInputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and/or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active near the measurement date.\nLevel 3:\nInputs include managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instruments valuation.\nThe fair value of the Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities were determined based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Level 2 instruments were valued based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company believes that the recorded values of its other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations. The Company did not have any marketable securities in the Level 3 category as of September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021. There have been no changes in Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 and no changes in valuation techniques for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nInstruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash equivalents and marketable securities: The following tables present the Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities costs, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value by major security type recorded as cash equivalents or short-term or long-term marketable securities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Unrealized gains and losses from the remeasurement of marketable securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until recognized in earnings upon the sale or maturity of the security.\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair Value\nCash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nSecurities\nLong-term\nSecurities\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds\n$ 1,316\n$ -\n$ 1,316\n$ 1,316\n$ -\n$ -\nLevel 2:\nCertificates of deposit\n-\n-\nMunicipal securities\n4,066\n(65 )\n4,001\n-\n3,772\nCorporate bonds\n2,402\n(25 )\n2,377\n-\n2,127\nSubtotal\n7,268\n(90 )\n7,178\n-\n6,397\nTotal\n$ 8,584\n$ (90 )\n$ 8,494\n$ 1,316\n$ 6,397\n$\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGain (Loss)\nFair Value\nCash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nSecurities\nLong-term\nSecurities\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds\n$\n$ -\n$\n$\n$ -\n$ -\nLevel 2:\nCertificates of deposit\n1,494\n-\n1,494\n-\nMunicipal securities\n5,139\n(1 )\n5,138\n-\n4,205\nCorporate bonds\n-\nSubtotal\n7,561\n-\n7,561\n-\n5,686\n1,875\nTotal\n$ 8,493\n$ -\n$ 8,493\n$\n$ 5,686\n$ 1,875\nInstruments measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nNonfinancial assets: Nonfinancial assets such as goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets held and used, and right-of-use assets (ROU assets) are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and recorded at fair value only when impairment is recognized or for a business combination.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are recognized at fair value during the period in which an acquisition is completed, from updated estimates during the measurement period, or when they are considered to be impaired. These non-recurring fair value measurements, primarily for goodwill and intangible assets acquired, were based on Level 3 inputs. The Company estimates the fair value of long-lived assets on a non-recurring basis based on a market valuation approach, engaging independent valuation experts to assist in the determination of fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, in conjunction with the annual impairment assessment, the Company determined that the fair value of the software reporting unit was less than the carrying value. In addition to increased costs and continued losses in the software reporting unit, the Company considered macroeconomic conditions including a deterioration in the equity markets evidenced by sustained declines in the Companys stock price, peer companies, and major market indices since September 30, 2021. The Company engaged independent valuation experts to assist in determining the fair value of the software reporting unit. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a $13,162 goodwill impairment charge associated with the software reporting unit.\nThe following table presents nonfinancial assets that were subject to fair value measurement during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. There were no business combinations during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Certain intangible assets, operating lease ROU assets and goodwill are subject to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nCarrying\nValue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nGain/ (Loss)\nGoodwill from software reporting unit\n$ 10,118\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 23,280\n$ (13,162 )\nOperating lease ROU asset\n$\n$ -\n$ -\n$\n$ -\nHoldback Liability: In connection with the Amika Mobile asset purchase, the Company recorded a holdback liability related to potential future adjustments to assets and liabilities, misrepresentations and indemnifications against third-party claims. Adjustments of up to CAD$1,000 (USD$728) will be deducted from the asset purchase holdback liability for up to three years from the closing date. The holdback liability was recorded at the present value which was the fair value at the acquisition date. The Company engaged independent valuation experts to assist in determining the present value of the holdback liability. The expected future payment was discounted using a rate representative of the Companys payment risk and credit rating. Accretion is recorded in each subsequent reporting period based on the discount factor used to arrive at the original fair value. This change in fair value is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The changes in the carrying amount of the holdback liability is as follows:\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$\nAccretion\nCurrency translation\n(55\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$\n6. INVENTORIES\nInventories consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30,\nRaw materials\n$ 5,277\n$ 5,449\nFinished goods\nWork in process\nInventories, gross\n6,865\n7,168\nReserve for obsolescence\n(857 )\n(752 )\nInventories, net\n$ 6,008\n$ 6,416\n7. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30,\nOffice furniture and equipment\n$ 1,432\n$ 1,261\nMachinery and equipment\n1,391\n1,270\nLeasehold improvements\n2,172\n2,154\nConstruction in progress\n-\nProperty and equipment, gross\n5,099\n4,685\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(3,342 )\n(2,930 )\nProperty and equipment, net\n$ 1,757\n$ 1,755\nYears ended September 30,\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n$\n$\n8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill is attributable to the acquisitions of Genasys Spain and Zonehaven, and the Amika Mobile asset purchase and is due to combining the integrated emergency critical communications, mass messaging solutions and software development capabilities with existing hardware products for enhanced offerings and the skill level of the acquired workforces. The Company periodically reviews goodwill for impairment in accordance with relevant accounting standards. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, in conjunction with the annual impairment assessment, the Company determined that the fair value of the software reporting unit was less than the carrying value. The Company engaged independent valuation experts to assist in determining the fair value of the software reporting unit and recorded a $13,162 goodwill impairment charge. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, goodwill was $10,118 and $23,834 respectively. There were no impairments to goodwill during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nIntangible assets and goodwill related to Genasys Spain are translated from Euro to U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date.

Payments to the service provider will be made annually upon completion of each year of service. A new contract was signed with the customer in May 2019 to continue repair and maintenance services through May 2024. These services are being recorded in cost of revenues to correspond with the revenues for these services.\nWarranty reserve\nDetails of the estimated warranty reserve were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nBeginning balance\n$\n$\nWarranty provision\nWarranty settlements\n(73 )\n(36 )\nEnding balance\n$\n$\nThe Company establishes a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels include the number of units sold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs and anticipated rates of warranty claims. The Company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for warranty costs each reporting period and adjusts the accrued warranty liability to an amount equal to estimated warranty expense for products currently under warranty.\nCanadian goods and services and harmonized sales tax payable\nThe GST/HST is a Canadian value-added tax that applies to many goods and services. This represents amounts owed to the Canadian Revenue Agency by the Companys Canadian subsidiary.\nDeferred extended warranty revenue\nDeferred extended warranty revenue consists of warranties purchased in excess of the Companys standard warranty. Extended warranties typically range from one to two years.\nAsset purchase holdback liability\nIn connection with the Amika Mobile asset purchase, the Company recorded a holdback liability related to potential future adjustments to assets and liabilities, misrepresentations and indemnifications against third-party claims.

The liability is recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.\n11. DEBT\nIn connection with the acquisition of Genasys Spain, the Company acquired certain debts of Genasys Spain. The carrying value of the acquired debt approximated fair value. The balances of the acquired debt consisted of loans with governmental agencies that were secured with cash collateral. In April 2022, the Ministry of Economy and Competiveness declared the terms of the loan satisfied and the outstanding balance was paid in full using the restricted cash that was pledged as collateral at loan inception as payment of the remaining balance.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of debt for the year ended September 30, 2022, are as follows:\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$\nPayments\n(277 )\nCurrency translation\n(19 )\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$ -\nRevolving line of credit\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for a $10 million revolving line of credit. Outstanding balances on the revolving line of credit bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.25%. The agreement contains a provision for determining an alternative interest rate index in the event the LIBOR rate is no longer available. The agreement contains standard covenants, including affirmative financial covenants, such as the maintenance of a short-term liquidity ratio and a senior leverage ratio, in addition to negative covenants which limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, loans and equity investments, disposition of assets, mergers and consolidations and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The maturity date of this revolving line of credit is March 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings on the revolving line of credit. The Company incurred and capitalized $38 of issuance costs related to this revolving line of credit. These issuance costs have and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan.\n12. LEASES\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The guidance in ASC 842 defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Additionally, the portfolio approach is used in determining the discount rate used to present value lease payments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.\nThe Company is party to operating leases for office and production facilities and equipment under agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new lease standard. In electing the practical expedient package, the Company is not required to reassess whether an existing or expired contract is or contains a lease, reassess the lease classification for expired or existing leases nor reassess the initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the adoption of ASC 842. The Company also elected the short-term lease exemption such that the new lease standard was applied to leases greater than one year in duration. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFor leases beginning on or after October 1, 2019, lease components are accounted for separately from non-lease components for all asset classes. Certain of the Companys leases contain renewal provisions and escalating rental clauses and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes and other operating expenses. The renewal provisions of existing lease agreements were not included in the determination of the operating lease liabilities and the ROU assets. Variable payments such as excess usage fees on existing equipment leases were not included in the determination of the lease liabilities and the ROU assets as the achievement of the specified target that triggers the variable lease payment is not considered probable. In addition, the Companys facility lease in Spain has an escalating lease clause based on a consumer price index which is considered a variable lease payment and is not included in the determination of the lease liability and ROU asset. A 10% increase in the index would increase the total lease liability approximately $42. The Companys leases do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company added an additional operating ROU asset of $466 and operating lease liabilities of $466 for office space and equipment. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company added an additional operating ROU asset of $259 and operating lease liabilities of $259 for office space. The tables below show the operating ROU assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2021, and the balances as of September 30, 2022, including the changes during the periods.\nOperating lease\nROU assets\nOperating lease ROU assets as of September 30, 2021\n$ 4,862\nAdditional operating lease ROU assets\nLess amortization of operating lease ROU assets\n(746 )\nEffect of exchange rate on operating lease ROU assets\n(41 )\nOperating lease ROU assets as of September 30, 2022\n$ 4,541\nOperating lease\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2021\n$ 6,608\nAdditional operating lease liabilities\nLess lease principal payments on operating lease liabilities\n(894 )\nEffect of exchange rate on operating lease liabilities\n(43 )\nOperating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022\n6,137\nLess non-current portion\n(5,189 )\nCurrent portion as of September 30, 2022\n$\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Companys operating leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of 5.7 years and a weighted-average discount rate of 4.1%. The maturities of the operating lease liabilities are as follows:\nFiscal year ending September 30,\n$ 1,179\n1,177\n1,154\n1,169\n1,191\nThereafter\n1,038\nTotal undiscounted operating lease payments\n6,908\nLess imputed interest\n(771 )\nPresent value of operating lease liabilities\n$ 6,137\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, total lease expense under operating leases was approximately $1,002 and $991, respectively. The Company did not have any short-term lease expense during the year ended September 30, 2022. For the year ended September 30, 2021, short-term lease expense was $3.\n13. INCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes consisted of the following:\nYears ended September 30,\nCurrent tax provision\nFederal\n$ -\n$ -\nState\nForeign\n-\nTotal current tax provision\nDeferred provision\nFederal\nState\nTotal deferred provision\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n$\nA reconciliation of income taxes at the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective tax rate was as follows:\nYears ended September 30,\nIncome taxes computed at the federal statutory rate\n$ (3,314 )\n$\nChange in valuation allowance\n1,065\nNondeductible compensation, interest expense and other\n4,101\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n(859 )\nChange in R&D credit carryover\n(186 )\nStock options and other prior year true-ups\n(175 )\nForeign rate differential\n(1 )\n(117 )\nState business credit utilization\n(90 )\n(234 )\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n$\n$\nThe types of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their approximate tax effects that give rise to a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nAt September 30,\nDeferred tax assets\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$ 10,054\n$ 11,769\nResearch and development credit\n4,712\n5,479\nShare-based compensation\nPatents\n2,331\nAccruals and other\n2,245\n2,487\nAllowances\nGross deferred tax assets\n20,310\n20,518\nDeferred tax liabilities\nEquipment\n(313 )\n(352 )\nOperating ROU assets\n(1,066 )\n(1,222 )\nAcquired intangible assets\n(2,180 )\n(2,592 )\nGross deferred tax liabilities\n(3,559 )\n(4,166 )\nLess valuation allowance\n(9,378 )\n(8,313 )\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities\n$ 7,373\n$ 8,039\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had net deferred tax assets of approximately $7,373. The deferred tax assets are primarily composed of federal and state NOL carryforwards and federal and state research and development (R&D) credit carryforwards. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $32,817, which expire from 2024 through 2037, except for $1,262 that have an indefinite carryforward period. The Company also has an estimated $2,500 and $119 of federal and state R&D tax credits, respectively, as of September 30, 2022, a portion of which will begin to expire in the current tax year.\nThe Company reviews its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. In doing so, management considers historical and projected taxable income of the Company, along with any tax planning strategies and any other positive or negative evidence. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards and other deferred assets. The Company expects to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future, except for those related to federal R&D tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards, R&D credits and foreign tax credits related to Genasys Spain continues to maintain a partial allowance of $9,378. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowances may be necessary.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Companys practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions. All of the Companys historical tax years are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various state jurisdictions due to the generation of NOL and credit carryforwards.\n14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases\nThe Company leases office equipment and operating facilities. During the year ended September 30, 2019, these leases were categorized as operating leases. On October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842 which required lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms of greater than 12 months. Refer to Note 12, Leases for further detail on lease commitments.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer that provides for severance benefits including twelve months salary and health benefits, a pro-rata share of his annual cash bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs to which he would have become entitled had he remained employed through the end of the fiscal year and vesting of a share of stock options held by him that are subject to performance-based vesting. The agreement also has a change in control clause whereby the chief executive officer would be entitled to receive specific severance and equity vesting benefits if specified termination events occur.\nThere were no other employment agreements with executive officers or other employees providing future benefits or severance arrangements.\nBonus Plan\nThe Company has a bonus plan for employees, in accordance with their terms of employment, whereby they can earn a percentage of their salary based on meeting targeted objectives for orders received, revenue, operating income, and operating cash flow. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded $1,733 of bonus expense. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded $2,625 of bonus expense.\nEmployee Benefit-401K Plan\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan (401(k)) covering its employees. Matching contributions are made on behalf of all participants at the discretion of the board of directors. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company made matching contributions of $324 and $219, respectively.\nLitigation\nThe Company may at times be involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business. The Company will, from time to time, when appropriate in managements estimation, record adequate reserves in the Companys financial statements for pending litigation.\nAmika Mobile asset purchase\nIn connection with the Amika Mobile asset purchase, the Company recorded a holdback liability related to potential future adjustments to assets and liabilities, misrepresentations and indemnifications against third-party claims. Adjustments of up to CAD$1,000 (USD$728) will be deducted from the asset purchase holdback liability for up to three years from the closing date. The liability is recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company also agreed to issue 191,267 shares of the Companys common stock to the seller of the Amika Mobile assets on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date. The total number of shares of common stock the Company is obligated to issue is 57,3801. The fair value of the Companys common stock on the closing date was $5.98, resulting in the addition of $3,431 to additional paid-in-capital. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company accelerated the issuance of 365,109 of such shares of common stock to the Seller of the Amika Mobile assets. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 69,564 shares of common stock to the Seller of the Amika Mobile assets. There are 139,128 remaining shares of the Companys common stock subject to issuance under this obligation.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under (i) its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, contractors, customers and landlords and (ii) its agreements with investors. Under these arrangements, the Company may indemnify other parties such as business partners, customers, underwriters, and investors for certain losses suffered, claims of intellectual property infringement, negligence and intentional acts in the performance of services, and violations of laws including certain violations of securities laws. The Companys obligation to provide such indemnification in such circumstances would arise if, for example, a third party sued a customer for intellectual property infringement and the Company agreed to indemnify the customer against such claims. The Company is unable to estimate with any reasonable accuracy the liability that may be incurred pursuant to such indemnification obligations. Some of the factors that would affect this assessment include, but are not limited to, the nature of the claim asserted, the relative merits of the claim, the financial ability of the parties, the nature and amount of damages claimed, insurance coverage that the Company may have to cover such claims, and the willingness of the parties to reach settlement, if any. Because of the uncertainty surrounding these circumstances, the Companys indemnification obligations could range from immaterial to having a material adverse impact on its financial position and its ability to continue in the ordinary course of business. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements in the past, and the Company had no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder its bylaws, the Company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director serving in such capacity. All directors and officers have executed indemnification agreements. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer or directors lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. However, the Company has a director and officers liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of its insurance policy coverage, the Company does not believe that a material loss exposure related to these agreements is either probable or can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, the Company has no liability recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n15. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock Option Plans\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had two equity incentive plans. The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Equity Plan) was terminated with respect to new grants in March 2015 but remains in effect for grants issued prior to that time. The Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Equity Plan) was adopted by the Companys Board of Directors on December 6, 2016 and approved by the Companys stockholders on March 14, 2017. The 2015 Equity Plan was amended by the Companys Board of Directors on December 8, 2020, to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000. On March 16, 2021, the Companys stockholders approved a plan amendment. The 2015 Equity Plan authorizes the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance awards, to an aggregate of 10,000,000 new shares of common stock to employees, directors, advisors or consultants. As of September 30, 2022, there were options and restricted stock units outstanding covering 10,000 and 4,274,074 shares of common stock under the 2005 Equity Plan and the 2015 Equity Plan, respectively, and 3,486,565 shares of common stock available for grant, for a total of 7,760,639 shares of common stock authorized and unissued under the two equity plans.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Companys stock options have various restrictions that reduce option value, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer and hedging, among others, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity.\nThere were 1,367,000 options granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 295,000 granted during the year ended September 30, 2021. The weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions (annualized percentages):\nYears ended\nSeptember 30,\nVolatility\n50.8 %\n48.5 %\nRisk-free interest rate\n2.6 %\n0.7 %\nDividend yield\n0.0 %\n0.0 %\nExpected term in years\n5.2\n6.5\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock over the period commensurate with the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on rates published by the Federal Reserve Board. The contractual term of the options was seven years. The expected term is based on observed and expected time to post-vesting exercise. The expected forfeiture rate is based on past experience and employee retention data. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Such revision adjustments to expense will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is changed. The Company did not pay a dividend in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there was approximately $1,620 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to outstanding stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.82 years. To the extent the forfeiture rate is different from what the Company anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from the Companys expectations.\nPerformance-Based Stock Options\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company awarded a performance-based stock option (PVO) to purchase 800,000 shares of the Companys common stock to a key executive, with a contractual term of seven years. Vesting is based upon the achievement of certain performance criteria for each of fiscal 2022 and 2023 including a minimum free cash flow margin and net revenue targets. Additionally, vesting is subject to the executive being employed by the Company at the time the Company achieves such financial targets. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company modified the performance criteria for these PVOs to exclude certain strategic growth initiatives that were not planned at the time of grant. The Company recorded $209 in stock-based compensation expense related to these options in the year ended September 30, 2022.\nOn August 10, 2022, the Company granted PVOs to purchase up to 750,000 shares of the Companys common stock to a key member of management, with a contractual term of seven years. Vesting is based upon the achievement of certain performance criteria for each of fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025, including net bookings targets. Additionally, vesting is subject to the grantee being employed by the Company as of the applicable vest date during each fiscal year in which the Company achieves such financial targets. The Company did not record compensation expense related to these options for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe Company did not grant any PVOs during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nRestricted Stock Units\nOn March 10, 2020, each non-employee member of the Board of Directors received a grant of 30,000 RSUs that vested on the first anniversary of the grant date. These were issued at a market value of $425, which were expensed on a straight-line basis through the March 10, 2021 vest date. Also, in fiscal 2020, 81,270 RSUs were granted to employees that will vest over three years on the anniversary date of the grant. These were issued at a market value of $258, which have and will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the three-year life of the grants.\nOn March 16, 2021, each non-employee member of the Board of Directors received a grant of 27,883 RSUs that vested on the first anniversary of the grant date. These were issued at a market value of $1,100 and were expensed on a straight-line basis through the March 16, 2022 vest date. Also, during fiscal 2021, 145,950 RSUs were granted to employees that will vest over three years on the anniversary date of the grant. These were issued at a market value of $989, which have and will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the three-year life of the grants.

These were issued at a market value of $407, which have and will be expensed on a straight-line basis through the March 15, 2023 vest date. On November 1, 2021, 10,000 RSUs were granted to a non-employee advisor that will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. These were issued at a market value of $51, which have and will be expensed on a straight-line basis though the November 1, 2022 vest date. Also, during the year ended September 30, 2022, there were 100,800 RSUs granted to employees that will vest over three years on the anniversary of the grant date. These were issued at a market value of $348, which have and will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the three-year life of the grants.\nCompensation expense for RSUs was $1,410 for the year ended September 30, 2022.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCommon Stock Activity\nOn March 18, 2021, the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Delaware to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock of the Company from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares (the Amended Certificate). The Amended Certificate was approved by the Companys stockholders at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders on March 16, 2021.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 145,235 shares of common stock and obtained gross proceeds of $282 in connection with the exercise of stock options. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company issued 104,796 shares of common stock and obtained gross proceeds of $210 in connection with the exercise of stock options. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 270,262 shares of common stock upon full vesting of RSUs. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company issued 228,633 shares of common stock upon full vesting of RSUs.\nIn connection with the Amika Mobile asset purchase, the Company also agreed to issue 191,267 shares of the Companys common stock to the seller of the Amika Mobile assets on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date. The total number of shares of common stock the Company is obligated to issue is 573,801. The fair value of the Companys common stock on the closing date was $5.98, resulting in the addition of $3,431 to additional paid-in-capital. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company accelerated the issuance of 365,109 of such shares of common stock to the Seller of the Amika Mobile assets. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 69,564 shares of common stock to the Seller of the Amika Mobile assets. There are 139,128 remaining shares of the Companys common stock subject to issuance under this obligation.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized under its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.00001 par value, without any further action by the stockholders. The board of directors has the authority to divide any and all shares of preferred stock into series and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock, such as the designation of series and the number of shares constituting such series, dividend rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation and dissolution preferences, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights, if any. Issuance of preferred stock by the board of directors could result in such shares having dividend and or liquidation preferences senior to the rights of the holders of common stock and could dilute the voting rights of the holders of common stock.\nNo shares of preferred stock were outstanding during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 or 2021.\nShare Buyback Program\nIn December 2022, the Board of Directors extended the Companys share buyback program through December 31, 2024. Under the program, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of its outstanding common shares.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, 259,310 shares were repurchased for $998. There were no shares repurchased during the year ended September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, all repurchased shares were retired.\n17. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method, which assumes that the proceeds from the exercise of the outstanding options are used to repurchase common stock at market value. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. If the Company has losses for the period, the inclusion of potential common stock instruments outstanding would be anti-dilutive. In addition, under the treasury stock method, the inclusion of stock options with an exercise price greater than the per-share market value would be antidilutive. Potential common shares that would be antidilutive are excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nYears ended\nSeptember 30,\nNet (loss) income\n$ (16,212 )\n$\nBasic (loss) income per share\n$ (0.44 )\n$ 0.02\nDiluted (loss)income per share\n$ (0.44 )\n$ 0.02\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic\n36,495,012\n34,409,478\nAssumed exercise of dilutive options\n-\n1,179,670\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n36,495,012\n35,589,148\nPotentially diluted securities outstanding at period end excluded from diluted computation as the inclusion would have been antidilutive:\nOptions\n3,940,899\n1,035,000\nRSU\n343,175\n208,692\nObligation to issue common stock\n139,128\n-\nTotal\n4,423,202\n1,243,692\n18.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, revenues from one customer accounted for 58% of total revenues with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of total revenues.

As of September 30, 2021, accounts receivable from two customers accounted for 66% and 18% of total accounts receivable.\nRevenue from customers in the United States was $45,703 for the year ended September 30, 2022.

In particular, the Company depends on one supplier of compression drivers for its LRAD products. If supplier shortages occur, or quality problems arise, then production schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nGENASYS INC.\nDecember 16, 2022\nBy:\n/s/ Richard S.
