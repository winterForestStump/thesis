    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nGEE Group Inc. (the Company, us, our or we) was incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1962 and is the successor to employment offices doing business since 1893. We are a provider of human resources solutions which primarily include the provision of temporary and permanent personnel in the professional and industrial services sectors to customers located in the United Sates. We, through our operating subsidiaries, deliver our services from a network of four virtual locations and 26 branch office locations located in or near several major U.S. cities, including, but not limited to: Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Miami.\nThe Company has several subsidiary corporations all of which are wholly owned and consolidated under GEE Group Inc. Our material operating subsidiaries include Access Data Consulting Corporation, Agile Resources, Inc., BMCH, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Logistics, Inc., and Triad Personnel Services, Inc. In addition, we and our operating subsidiaries own and operate under other trade names, including Accounting Now, Ashley Ellis, Staffing Now\u00ae, SNI Banking, SNI Certes\u00ae, SNI Energy\u00ae, SNI Financial\u00ae, SNI Technology\u00ae, GEE Group (Columbus), General Employment, Omni One and Triad Staffing.\nServices Provided\nWe provide our services to a broad range of customers from small and medium-sized businesses to the Fortune 1000. Our services include the provision of highly specialized contract or permanently placed professionals in several verticals, including IT, engineering, accounting and finance, office support, and specialized contract healthcare professionals, including scribes who specialize in electronic medical record (EMR) services for emergency departments, specialty physician practices and clinics. We also provide temporary staffing services in the light industrial (blue collar) areas.\nOur contract and placement services are principally provided under two operating divisions or segments: Professional Staffing Services and Industrial Staffing Services.\nOur operating subsidiaries and end markets served under each of its operating divisions are as follows:\nProfessional Division\n\u00b7\nAccess Data Consulting provides hard-to-find IT talent to customers on a direct hire or contract basis and human resources consulting services and solutions in the higher-end IT vertical including project management support to businesses regionally (Western and Southwestern U.S.) and, to a lesser extent, throughout the rest of the U.S.\n\u00b7\nAgile Resources delivers unique CIO advisory services, IT project support and human resources solutions regionally (Southeastern U.S.) and, to a lesser extent, nationally in the areas of application architecture and delivery, enterprise operations, digital, information lifecycle management and project management all with flexible delivery options including contract staffing and direct hire.\n\u00b7\nAshley Ellis works with C-suite and senior executives to offer full cycle engineering and IT contract staffing services, with a focus on business intelligence, application development and network infrastructure, to clients in the Southeastern U.S. region and, to a lesser extent, throughout the rest of the U.S.\n\u00b7\nGEE Group (Columbus) primarily provides direct hire placement and contract staffing services in the accounting and engineering verticals, with an emphasis on placing personnel with specialized skills in the mechanical, manufacturing and equipment maintenance areas to clients throughout the Midwestern U.S.\n\u00b7\nOmni One specializes in technical and professional direct-hire and contract staffing solutions in the manufacturing and engineering verticals for clients primarily located in the Midwestern U.S.\n\u00b7\nPaladin Consulting primarily provides highly skilled IT professionals on a contract or direct hire basis directly to customers or through RPO, MSP and VMS arrangements and other non-IT staffing solutions to customers nationwide including government contractors who require that the provider of staffing services have required security clearance; such security certification is maintained by Paladin Consulting.\n\u00b7\nScribe Solutions provides hospital and free-standing emergency rooms and physician practices in the Southeastern U.S. with highly trained medical scribes for personal assistant work in connection with EMR.\n\u00b7\nSNI Companies provides human resource solutions, including direct hire and contract staffing, project support and retained search services specializing primarily in the accounting, finance, banking, IT and office support verticals to customers located in major U.S. metropolitan markets, such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago, Denver, Miami, Minneapolis, Princeton, Tampa, Jacksonville, Hartford, Andover and surrounding areas. SNI Companies brands include Accounting Now, Staffing Now\u00ae, SNI Banking, SNI Certes\u00ae, SNI Energy\u00ae, SNI Financial\u00ae, and SNI Technology\u00ae.\nIndustrial Division\n\u00b7\nTriad Staffing provides light industrial contract labor services for all phases of manufacturing and electronic assembly, warehousing, picking, packing and shipping and custodial and general labor operations throughout Ohio.\nThe percentage of revenues derived from each of the Companys direct hire and contract services lines are as follows:\nFiscal\nProfessional direct hire placement services\n12.7%\n16.1%\nProfessional contract services\n78.7%\n74.2%\nIndustrial contract services\n8.6%\n9.7%\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is multi-dimensional and encompasses both organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions. Since 2015, the Company has completed four acquisitions, the most recent of which was SNI, which to date has been its largest. The main tenants of our strategy are to grow organically by:\n\u00b7\nProviding innovative solutions for clients delivered through an enhanced and expanded menu of professional services offerings while increasing the penetration of clients in our existing markets for our IT, finance and accounting, healthcare, engineering and office support verticals;\n\u00b7\nEntering other fast-growing markets following existing customers who are expanding their operations and cross-selling services by leveraging strategic customer relationships capitalizing on the Companys national managed services agreements MSA, MSP and VMS relationships;\n\u00b7\nExpanding our geographic footprint of professional services offerings into new markets believed to possess high growth potential, particularly with regard to our IT brands;\n\u00b7\nAdding recruiting and sales talent to our existing delivery network to obtain new customers and increase the number of placements made to increase revenue;\n\u00b7\nIncreasing scalability and expanding operating margins through the on-going process of streamlining back office operations, establishing and leveraging regional centers of excellence, improving upon per desk production averages, elimination of duplicative costs among our businesses, and continued realization of economies of scale; and\n\u00b7\nCapitalizing on hiring opportunities created by volatility in the economic and labor markets by providing on-demand labor to fill the personnel voids of businesses following corporate Americas reactions and resulting on-going realignments since the on-set of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the economy recovers and companies have returned to sustained operations and growth, demand for our services has accelerated, with a particular focus on IT, E-Commerce and Logistics. We expect to continue to capitalize on these opportunities and to explore and innovate others, particularly in IT, including frontier areas such as digital content and information management disciplines.\nGrowth Through Strategic Acquisitions:\nSince 2015, a significant portion of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions of complementary businesses. We intend to continue to expand our business through strategic acquisitions, subject to our business plans and managements ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition or investment targets in both new and existing service categories. Along with our significant business growth to date, we have built a robust platform with the appropriate infrastructure and scalability, which we believe is necessary to assimilate acquisitions.\nWe continue to explore opportunities for potential acquisitions in the fragmented staffing industry. Our acquisition strategy includes, but is not limited to, targeting companies or transactions that we believe may have one or more of the following characteristics:\n\u00b7\nA focus on IT specialties and other verticals, including cyber security, government and targets in the professional services sectors;\n\u00b7\nA well-managed business with experienced operators and with high gross profit and EBITDA margins, as well as consistent revenue growth;\n\u00b7\nLimited enterprise risk and successful due diligence; and\n\u00b7\nPricing commensurate with profitability and growth, must be accretive to earnings and consideration generally consisting of a combination of cash, seller and/or bank financing and stock.\nMarketing\nWe market our staffing services using our corporate and trade names in our respective vertical markets. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely. We have offices or serve markets remotely, as follows; (i) one office in each of Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Jersey, and one remote local market presence in Virginia; (ii) two offices each in Georgia and Massachusetts; (iii) three offices in Colorado; (iv) two offices and two additional local market presences in Texas; (v) six offices and one additional local market presence in Florida; and (vi) seven offices in Ohio.\nWe market our staffing services to prospective clients primarily through the use of the internet, specialty brands and corporate websites, digital direct mail campaigns, publishing annual electronic and widely distributed salary guides, advertising in tech, HR and accounting publications, attendance and booth displays at specialty trade shows, participation and membership in chambers of commerce and other business organizations, and support for our employees philanthropic activities. Our sales consultants and business development managers also engage in telephone marketing using our CRM tools to identify prospects, and through the mailing of tailored employment bulletins which list highly-skilled candidates available for placement and contract employees available for assignment.\nThere was no customer that represented more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenue in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.\nCompetition\nThe staffing industry is highly fragmented with a multitude of competitors. There are relatively few barriers to entry by firms offering direct hire placement and staff augmentation services although significant amounts of working capital typically are required to fund the payroll of temporary workers for businesses providing contract staffing services. New entrants to the staffing industry are constantly introduced to the marketplace. Our competitors include sole-proprietorship operations, local and regional firms as well as national organizations. In the U.S., large national firms have annual revenue of approximately $100 million and up to $10 billion. Local and regional firms yearly revenue can range from one to several million dollars or more. The largest portion of the marketplace consists of small, individual-sized or family-run operations. With low barriers to entry, sole proprietorships and smaller entities routinely enter the staffing industry. Many competitors are larger corporations with substantially greater resources than ours; however, as described below, we believe we are able to compete successfully in the verticals and end markets in which we operate.\nOur professional and industrial staffing services compete effectively by providing highly qualified candidates who are well matched for the position, by developing and maintaining outstanding client relationships on a local level, by responding quickly to client requests, and by establishing offices and presences in convenient locations. As part of our services, we provide professional reference checking, scrutiny of candidates work experience and optional custom background checks. In general, we believe that a positive client experience is most important, and pricing often is secondary to quality of service as a competitive factor. During slow hiring periods, competition can put pressure on our pricing; however, we believe we are able to effectively compete on price in such situations.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe that we are able to compete effectively in the staffing industry because we have:\n\u00b7\nDeep experience and vertical specialization and expertise in niche markets;\n\u00b7\nInvested in robust sales programs and marketing tools and technology and CRM software to successfully target and reach out to potential new customers;\n\u00b7\nLong-tenured division leaders, business development managers and vertical specialists (e.g., certified public accountants for accounting, tax and financial placements) with deep and relevant staffing industry experience;\n\u00b7\nStrong and proven capability to deliver outstanding results for our clients under significant time constraints on large-scale projects leveraging our wide office network and experienced project team leaders, including experience with MSP and VMS programs;\n\u00b7\nWell established strategies and procedures for both temporary and permanent virtual working supported by technology to facilitate communication, recruiting, onboarding and management of the business virtually;\n\u00b7\nSpecialized state-of-the-art databases, applicant tracking systems (ATS) and other technology tools that facilitate swift, expert matching of candidates to job requirements providing highly-qualified multiple choices to clients;\n\u00b7\nLocalized decision-making and a lack of a multi-layered bureaucracy which provides for more rapid responses to customized client requests and a streamlined approval process in place for speedy recruitment of personnel; and\n\u00b7\nHands-on training with specialized modules for newly hired recruiters and account management personnel.\nRecruiting\nThe success of our services is highly dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified candidates. Prospective employment candidates are generally recruited through job postings and contact made electronically using various internet tools as well as telephone contact by our employment consultants. For internet postings, we maintain our corporate web page at www.geegroup.com and our specialty brand web pages in addition to extensive use of internet job posting bulletin board services. We also maintain database records of applicants skills through our ATS to assist in matching applicant skills with job openings and contract assignments. We generally screen, interview and, in many cases background check, all applicants who are presented to our clients.\nIndustry Overview\nThe staffing industry is divided into three major segments: temporary staffing services, professional employer organizations (PEOs) and placement agencies. Temporary staffing services provide workers for limited periods, often to substitute for absent permanent workers or to help during periods of peak demand. These workers, who are often employees of the temporary staffing agency, will generally fill clerical, technical, or industrial positions. PEOs, sometimes referred to as employee leasing agencies, contract to provide workers to customers for specific functions, often related to human resource management. In many cases, a customers employees are hired by a PEO and then contracted back to the customer. Placement agencies, sometimes referred to as executive recruiters or headhunters, find workers to fill permanent positions at customer companies. These agencies may specialize in placing senior managers, mid-level managers, technical workers, or clerical and other support workers.\nOur business is mainly that of a temporary staffing company within the broader staffing industry, however, we also offer and provide permanent placement services in our Professional Staffing Services segment. We employ the substantial portion of our staff members we place on temporary assignments with our clients. In addition to assisting our clients in managing peaks and valleys in their staffing needs, the temporary workers we place come in the form of a broader human resources management solution. That is, our clients do not bear the usual employment risks and compliance burdens associated with our temporary workers; instead, we retain these costs and risks as the employer of record. We believe this is a significant value add for our temporary staffing clients.\nStaffing companies identify potential candidates through online advertising and referrals, and interview, test and counsel workers before sending them to the customer for approval. Pre-employment screening can include skills assessment and reference checking, as well as drug tests and criminal background checks. The personnel staffing industry has been radically changed by the internet. Many employers list available positions with one or several internet personnel sites, such as those offered by firms like Monster or CareerBuilder, and on their own websites. Personnel agencies operate their own sites and often still work as intermediaries by helping employers accurately describe job openings and by screening candidates who submit applications.\nMajor end-use customers include businesses from virtually all industries. Marketing involves direct sales presentations, referrals from existing clients and advertising. Agencies compete both for customers and workers. Depending on market supply and demand at any given time, agencies may allocate more resources either to finding potential employers or potential workers. Permanent placement agencies work either on a retained or on a contingency basis. Clients may retain an agency for a specific job search or on contract for a specific period. Temporary staffing services charge customers a fixed price per hour or a standard markup on prevailing hourly rates.\nFor many staffing companies, including ours, demand is lower late in the fourth calendar quarter and early in the first calendar quarter, partly because of holidays, and is higher during the rest of the year. Staffing companies may have high receivables from customers. Temporary staffing agencies and PEOs must manage a high cash flow because they make payroll payments to their employees on behalf of client employers. Cash flow imbalances also occur because agencies must pay workers even if they have not been paid by clients.\nThe revenue of staffing companies depends on the number of jobs they fill, which in turn can depend upon the economic environment. During economic slowdowns, many client companies may slow down or stop hiring altogether. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many client companies closed their businesses and stopped hiring or contracting employees. Internet employment sites expand a Companys ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Staffing companies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of personnel agencies obsolete. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing agency.\nTo avoid large placement agency fees, big companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge a fee based on a percentage of the first years salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill have a financial incentive to avoid use of agencies.\nMany staffing companies are small and may depend heavily on a big customer for a large portion of revenue. Large customer concentration may lead to increased revenue, but also expose agencies to higher risks. When major accounts experience financial hardships, and have less need for temporary employment services, agencies stand to lose large portions of revenue.\nThe loss of a staff member who handles a large volume of business may result in a large loss of revenue for a staffing company. Individual staff members, rather than the staffing company itself, often develop strong relationships with customers. Non-compete agreements are commonly used by staffing companies, however, staff members who move to another staffing company are often able to work around terms and conditions of their non-compete agreements and move customers with them.\nSome of the best opportunities for temporary employment are in industries traditionally active in seasonal cycles, such as manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail. However, seasonal demand for workers also creates cash flow fluctuations throughout the year.\nStaffing companies are subject to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. Many federal anti-discrimination rules regulate the type of information that employment firms can request from candidates or provide to customers about candidates. In addition, the relationship between the agency and its temporary employees, or its employee candidates may not always be clear, resulting in legal and regulatory uncertainty.\nTrends in the Staffing Business\nStart-up costs for a staffing company can be relatively low. Individual offices can be profitable and consolidation is driven by opportunities for large or growing agencies to develop national relationships with big customers or build resources and scale for future growth. Some agencies expand by starting new offices in promising markets, others prefer to buy existing independent offices with proven staff and an existing customer roster, while still others focus on both.\nAt some companies, temporary workers have become such a large part of the workforce that staffing company employees sometimes work at the customers site to recruit, train, and manage temporary employees. Staffing companies try to match the best qualified employees for the customers needs, but often provide additional training specific to that company, such as instruction in the use of proprietary software.\nSome personnel consulting firms and human resource departments use psychological tests to evaluate potential job candidates. In addition to more comprehensive background checks, headhunters often check the credit history of prospective employees.\nWe believe the trends of outsourcing entire departments and dependence on temporary and leased workers will continue to expand creating opportunities for staffing companies. Taking advantage of their in-house expertise in assessing worker capabilities, some staffing companies manage their clients entire human resource functions. Human resources outsourcing (HRO) may include management of personnel and payroll administration, tax filings, and benefit administration services. HRO may also include recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), whereby an agency manages all recruitment activities for a client.\nNew online technology is improving staffing efficiency. For example, some online applications coordinate workflow for staffing agencies, their clients and temporary workers, and allow agencies and customers to share work order requests, submit and track candidates, approve timesheets and expenses, and run reports. Interaction between candidates and potential employers is increasingly being handled online.\nInitially viewed as rivals, some Internet job-search companies and traditional employment agencies are now collaborating. While some Internet sites do not allow agencies to use their services to post jobs or look through resumes, others find that agencies are their biggest customers, earning the sites a large percentage of their revenue. Some staffing companies contract to help client employers find workers online.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused staffing companies to significantly rethink and alter their operations and, in some cases, even their fundamental business models. Staffing companies played a prominent, if not leading, role in recent new workplace trends, including flexible scheduling and remote work arrangements, as two significant examples. A natural result of the shutdowns, quarantines, social distancing and other COVID-19 guidelines is reinforcement of these types of newer workplace trends in many cases. Therefore, we expect that even as the threat of COVID-19 has substantially lessened, these workplace trends are likely to continue on and occupy a permanent place going forward.\nMost recently, the staffing industry overall has experienced a material decline in business during 2023, following record or near record performance in 2022. Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA), a leading industry trade organization, recently published in its September 2023 Industry Forecast update, that the U.S. Staffing Industry is expected to decline by 10% in 2023. The SIA report cites forecasted declines in virtually all professional and industrial or commercial verticals. The identified causes vary within different verticals and scenarios, with the overall level of uncertainties that persist in the U.S. and global economies and labor markets receiving significant mention. Other cited causes of the decline particularly in light industrial and administrative and clerical markets are the rise of new B2C trends, such as Uber and DoorDash, and, in other markets, side gigs that offer potential candidates alternative opportunities and increased competition for recruiters.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 251 regular employees and the number of contract service employees varied week to week during fiscal 2023, from a minimum of approximately 1,530 to a maximum of 1,996.\nOur Corporate Information\nWe were incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1962 and are the successor to employment offices doing business since 1893. Our principal executive offices are located at 7751 Belfort Parkway, Suite 150, Jacksonville, Florida 32256, and our telephone number at that location is (904) 512-7501.\nAvailable Public Information\nWe file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The public may obtain these filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington DC 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding the Company and other companies that file material with the SEC electronically. Copies of the Companys reports can be obtained, free of charge, electronically through our internet website, www.geegroup.com. Information on the Companys website is not incorporated in this report by the foregoing reference. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nTHE U.S. ECONOMY CURRENTLY IS BEING NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT INFLATION, A LOOMING RESCESSION, AND DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY AND THE WORKFORCE; RECENT GLOBAL SOCIOECONOMIC TRENDS, INCLUDING THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND U.S. RELATIONS WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN POWERS MAY HAVE A FURTHER ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE U.S. ECONOMY AND OUR BUSINESS.\nThe U.S. and larger global economies experienced historically high inflation during 2022, which continued into 2023. The Federal Reserve and other Central Banks already have raised interest rates more aggressively and to their highest levels in decades. As a result, the prospect for a recession is considered by many to be likely. Some sources have declared that the U.S. already has experienced a recession. Consumer prices, including basic costs of food, fuel, utilities, healthcare, mortgage and personal loan rates, and other non-discretionary and discretionary consumer items have risen significantly. Wages are up, however, increases in wages have lagged price inflation resulting in a net decline in real personal incomes relative to consumer spending. Volatility continues to exist in the workforce making it more difficult and costly for employers to recruit, hire and/or retain workers. U.S. unemployment remains relatively low, however the labor utilization rate and ratio of workers to the total population also remain low. Shortages in the workforce are a significant factor in supply shortages relative to demand and also help fuel inflation. On the global stage, two wars are now being waged, the first led by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the second, following the recent invasion of Israel by Hamas terrorists. These and overtures by China over Taiwan and the South China Sea, also add instability to the uncertainty driving socioeconomic forces, which in turn, impact the Companys and its subsidiaries operations.\nThe present conditions and state of our U.S. and global economies make it difficult to predict the extent to which a recession has occurred or will occur or worsen in the near future, and we and other members of the U.S. Staffing Industry already have seen significant declines in business in 2023. In the event of recurring or worsening conditions, in which the U.S. economy remains uncertain or contracts, we expect that our business will continue to be negatively impacted, accordingly. The Company has taken significant actions to shore up its resources and means in order to mitigate the negative effects of economic downturns; however, should economic conditions remain uncertain or worsen in the future, one may expect either scenario to continue to have an adverse effect on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nTHE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND ITS SUBSEQUENT VARIANTS, CARES ACT REQUIREMENTS, AND TRENDS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nRecent global socioeconomic conditions, including the negative effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19), and disruption of financial markets, severely affected our business and results of operations during fiscal 2020 and, although to a lesser extent, fiscal 2021. The negative effects initially limited our access to credit or equity capital, our ability to refinance debt and disrupted ours and our clients businesses. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, we were able to regain reasonable access to credit and equity capital markets, but also have continued to experience some lingering negative effects on our business operations in certain markets.\nThe operations and liquidity of our operating subsidiaries were severely impacted by COVID-19. As a result and out of necessity, in fiscal 2020, we applied for and obtained financial relief in the form of funds received in exchange for promissory notes issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Treasury under the Payroll Protection Program of the CARES Act (PPP loans). The Company and eight of its operating subsidiaries received PPP loans, totaling $19,927 thousand, and have since applied for and received forgiveness of their respective PPP loans from the SBA. The forgiveness of these loans, including their respective accrued and unpaid interest amounts, have been recognized by eliminating them from the Companys consolidated balance sheets with corresponding gains in consolidated net income in fiscal 2021 and 2022.\nThe former PPP loans obtained by GEE Group Inc., and its operating subsidiaries together as an affiliated group, exceeded the $2 million audit threshold established by the SBA, and therefore, will be subject to audit by the SBA in the future. If any of the nine forgiven PPP loans are reinstated in whole or in part as the result of a future audit, a charge or charges would be incurred, accordingly, and they would need to be repaid. If the companies are unable to repay the portions of their PPP loans that ultimately may be reinstated from available liquidity or operating cash flow, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt capital to repay the PPP loans.\nTHE TERMS OF OUR SENIOR BANK ASSET BACKED LOAN AGREEMENT MAY PLACE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVENANTS OR TO SATISFY CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN ACCELERATION OF OUR REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS AND CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES TO DECLINE.\nGEE Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, Agile Resources, Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, BMCH, Inc., GEE Group Portfolio, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Personnel Services, Inc., and Triad Logistics, Inc. are co-borrowers under a Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement for a $20 million asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility with CIT Bank, N.A. (the CIT Facility). The CIT Facility is collateralized by 100% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries who are co-borrowers and/or guarantors. The CIT Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (May 14, 2026). The CIT Facility contains some restrictions and limitations that might inhibit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may otherwise be in our long-term best interests. The affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business include covenants that limit and restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, transfer or sell certain assets, issue stock of subsidiaries, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions with respect to our capital stock or make other restricted payments, incur or permit liens or other encumbrances on assets, make certain investments, loans and advances, acquire other businesses, merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain transactions with our affiliates and amend certain agreements, without amendment of the CIT facility or the express approval of CIT Bank. Under the CIT Facility, advances are subject to a borrowing base formula based on 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the Company and subsidiaries, as defined, and subject to certain other criteria, conditions, and applicable reserves, including any additional eligibility requirements as determined by the administrative agent. Although the stated face amount of the CIT Facility is $20 million, the borrowing base formula significantly limits amounts available for us to borrow.\nThe CIT Facility also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment default, bankruptcy events, cross-default, breaches of covenants and representations and warranties, change of control and judgment defaults. A breach of any of these covenants could result in default under our Credit Agreement, which could prompt the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, a breach of the Credit Agreement would cause a cross-default of certain other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders under the Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our other indebtedness. An acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE OR BORROW SUFFICIENT CASH TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED, OUR BUSINESS COULD FAIL AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations is dependent upon our financial and operating performance, which is affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. While we believe we will be able to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future and for at least the next twelve months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nTHE COMPANY HAS MATERIAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, CUSTOMER LISTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES. THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT RISKS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FUTURE MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TO INCOME AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY.\nThe Company is required to evaluate its goodwill annually or when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The other long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, have to be tested for impairment only when triggering events occur or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. The Company has recognized impairments of its goodwill, including most recently during the first quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. In testing for impairments, management applies one or more valuation techniques to estimate the fair values of the reporting units, individual assets or groups of individual assets, as required under the circumstances. These valuation techniques rely on assumptions and other factors, such as the estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and the market comparable assumptions. Changes to input assumptions and other factors used or considered in the analysis could result in materially different evaluations of impairment.\nThe valuation techniques utilized by management, for impairment testing, including estimated future cash flows, fundamentally include the inherent underlying assumption that the economy, the markets served by the Company, and the Company itself, will continue to grow. In the event the assumptions relied upon by management are not achieved, including assumed future growth rates, impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded and such amounts could be material to the consolidated financial statements. A reduction in the projected long-term operating performance of one or both of the Companys reporting units or other long-lived assets, future market declines, changes in discount rates or other conditions also could result in material impairments in the future. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Companys goodwill or other long-lived assets will not become impaired in the future.\nWE HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY THOSE NEEDS FROM CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS OR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS.\nWe require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. We often have high receivables from our customers, and as a staffing company, we are prone to cash flow imbalances because we have to fund payroll payments to temporary workers before receiving payments from clients for our services. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If a sustained shortfall were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to fund expenses relating to our temporary workers and our other operating expenses and liabilities. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary workers and fund related tax liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers.\nIn addition, our operating results tend to be unpredictable from quarter to quarter. Demand for our services is typically lower during traditional national vacation periods in the United States when customers and candidates are on vacation. No single quarter is predictive of results of future periods. Any extended period of time with low operating results or cash flow imbalances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive working capital for our operations through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The amount we are entitled to borrow under our debt instruments is calculated monthly based on the aggregate value of certain eligible trade accounts receivable generated from our operations, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows. The aggregate value of our eligible accounts receivable may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities, which could reduce our ability to react to changes in the market or industry conditions.\nOUR REVENUE CAN VARY BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS CAN TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AT ANY TIME WITH LIMITED OR NO PENALTY.\nWe focus on providing professional and light industrial personnel on a temporary assignment-by-assignment basis, which customers can generally terminate at any time or reduce their level of use when compared to prior periods. To avoid large placement agency fees, large companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge fees as a mark-up to the hourly pay rate or based on a percentage of the first years salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill may have a large financial incentive to avoid agencies.\nOur business is also significantly affected by our customers hiring needs and their views of their future prospects. Our customers may, on very short notice, terminate, reduce or postpone their recruiting assignments with us and, therefore, affect demand for our services. As a result, a significant number of our customers can terminate their agreements with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to a significant decrease in revenue within a short period of time that could be difficult to quickly replace. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMOST OF OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT OBLIGATE OUR CUSTOMERS TO UTILIZE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR STAFFING SERVICES AND MAY BE CANCELLED ON LIMITED NOTICE, SO OUR REVENUE STREAM MAY BE INCONSISTENT AND IS NOT GUARANTEED.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from multi-year contracts that are terminable for convenience of the customer. Under our multi-year agreements, we contract to provide customers with staffing services through work or service orders at the customers request. Under these agreements, our customers often have little or no obligation to request our staffing services. In addition, most of our contracts are cancellable on limited notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. We may hire employees permanently to meet anticipated demand for services under these agreements that may ultimately be delayed or cancelled. We could face a significant decline in revenues and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if:\n\u00b7\nwe see a significant decline in the staffing services requested from us under our service agreements; or\n\u00b7\nour customers cancel or defer a significant number of staffing requests; or our existing customer agreements expire or lapse and we cannot renew or replace them with similar agreements.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN A BROAD GROUP OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS, LOSE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, OR FAIL TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER.\nIncreasing the growth and profitability of our business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional customers. Our ability to do so is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality services and offer competitive prices. If we are unable to execute these tasks effectively, we may not be able to attract a significant number of new customers and our existing customer base could decrease, including the loss of a significant customer, either or all of which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nSUBSTANTIAL ALTERATION OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS AND REVENUE MODEL COULD HURT SHORT-TERM RESULTS.\nOur present business and revenue model represents our view of optimal business and revenue generation, which is to derive revenues and achieve profitability in the shortest period. There can be no assurance that current models will not be altered significantly or replaced with one or more alternatives driven by motivations other than near-term revenues and/or profitability (for example, building market share ahead of our competitors). Any such alteration or replacement of our current business and revenue model may ultimately result in the deferring of certain revenues in favor of potentially establishing larger market share. We cannot assure that any such adjustment or change in the business and revenue model would prove to be successful whether adopted in response to industry changes or for other reasons.\nWE DEPEND ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE KEY EMPLOYEES OR AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and on certain other mission-critical individual contributors. We rely on our leadership team for the management and oversight of our business operations, including but not limited to, developing and executing our strategy, business and financial planning, research and development, marketing, sales, human resources, client services, finance, and other general and administrative functions,. From time to time, our executive management team may change from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. Employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel contain terms and conditions while employed by us, however, they also continue to be considered at will employees and, as such, they are not legally required to continue to work for us for any specified period and may terminate their employment with us at any time should they choose. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced software engineers and senior sales executives. If we are unable to attract such personnel in cities where we are located, we may need to hire in other locations, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. We expect to continue to experience challenges in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Extended stay-at-home, business closure, and other restrictive orders also may be expected to impact our ability to identify, hire, and train new personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it could adversely affect our business and future growth prospects.\nWE DEPEND ON ATTRACTING, INTEGRATING, MANAGING, AND RETAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our clients needs. Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, decrease in compensation levels relative to our competitors, modifications to our total compensation philosophy that might be perceived negatively, or aggressive competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire and retain required qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively impacted. Our future success also depends upon our ability to manage the successful performance of our personnel. Failure to successfully manage the performance of our personnel could affect our profitability by causing operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses and reduce operating income.\nWE DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TEMPORARY WORKERS.\nIn addition to the members of our own team, our success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain large numbers of qualified temporary workers who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers. We are required to continually evaluate our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future.\nStaffing Industry Analysts, a leading industry trade organization, recently published in its September 2023 Industry Forecast update, that the U.S. Staffing Industry is expected to decline by 10% in 2023. The identified causes vary within different market verticals and scenarios, with the overall level of uncertainties that persist in the U.S. and global economies and labor markets receiving significant mention. Other cited causes of the decline particularly in light industrial and administrative and clerical markets are the rise of new B2C trends, such as Uber and DoorDash, and, in other markets, side gigs that offer alternative opportunities to potential employment candidates and increased competition amongst recruiters.\nWE OPERATE IN AN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT OUR SERVICES COULD BECOME OBSOLETE OR UNCOMPETITIVE.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive and include many larger, more established companies. Our markets are characterized by pressures to provide high levels of service, incorporate new capabilities and technologies, accelerate job completion schedules and reduce prices. Furthermore, we face competition from a number of sources, including other executive search firms and professional search, staffing and consulting firms. Several of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. New and existing competitors are aided by technology, and the market has low barriers to entry. Furthermore, Internet employment sites expand a companys ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Personnel agencies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may attract technology-oriented companies to the professional staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company.\nOur future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with those developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, we believe that, with continuing development and increased availability of IT, the industries in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies become obsolete or uncompetitive, our related sales and revenue would decrease. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH OR RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.\nWe are subject to the same federal, state, and local laws as other companies conducting placement and staffing services, which are extensive. The adoption or modification of laws that affect the placement and staffing industry, including but not limited to, Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to labor and minimum wages, workplace standards and safety, workers compensation laws, independent contractor status, the Family Medical Leave Act, Affordable Care Act, and others could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition by increasing our costs and administrative burdens.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC GOALS.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing that may be required to continue to expand our business. Our continued viability depends on our ability to raise capital. Changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions may lead to cost increases. Management may also determine that it is in our best interest to expand more rapidly than currently intended, to expand marketing activities, to develop new or enhance existing services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary services, businesses or technologies. In any such case or other change of circumstance, additional financing will be necessary. If any additional financing is required, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us and at times required by us, if at all. In such event, we may be required to materially alter our business plan or curtail all or a part of our expansion plans.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE EXPECTED GROWTH AND INTERNAL EXPANSION.\nOur ability to manage growth effectively will be important to our business and future results of operations and financial condition. Expansion of our resources and operations will be required to address anticipated growth of our customer base and market opportunities. Expansion may be expected to place additional strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and thereby our ability to provide quality services and support for our clients and other stakeholders. In these regards, we anticipate the need to enhance existing resources, processes and controls, including but not limited to, implementation of new operational and financial systems, and development of additional procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our growing employee base and to service new and growing customers. Our failure to manage growth effectively, therefore, could have a materially negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGY SERVICES, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE DAMAGE, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR FAILURES IN OUR COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nOur business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, and we may lose data. Our customers businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate. If an interruption by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems occurs, we could be liable and the market perception of our services could be harmed.\nWE COULD BE HARMED BY IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OR LOSS OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, ASSOCIATE OR CLIENT DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL DATA, BY EMPLOYEE ERROR AND/OR CYBER RISKS.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. In doing so, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes. We and our third-party vendors have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs.\nSuch disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we introduce new services and offerings, such as mobile technology. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nWE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A NETWORK SECURITY INCIDENT AFFECTING OUR IT NETWORK, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND STORED INFORMATION. NETWORK SECURITY INCIDENTS AFFECTING OUR SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS THIS ONE OR OTHERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND HAVE WIDER-REACHING MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company detected and stopped a network security incident. An unauthorized third party gained access into our network, encrypted various systems, and demanded money to decrypt the affected systems and to delete and not publicly release stolen information. The Companys IT professionals immediately disconnected and isolated the affected systems to prevent any further compromise. The senior executive management team was immediately notified who in turn reported the network security incident to the Companys Audit Committee chairman who has board oversight authority for these types of matters. The Companys audit committee and board of directors were fully briefed and a special committee of the board of directors was appointed to assist and oversee management in the investigations, response and full remediation of the incident. The Company engaged third party cyber security experts to assist its internal IT professionals and conducted a comprehensive investigation to determine the extent of the unauthorized activity. The Company also notified law enforcement and its cyber liability insurance carrier about the incident.\nThe Companys investigation determined that the unauthorized third party acquired a relatively small amount of data maintained on the encrypted servers, to include in some cases, individual personal information such as names, social security numbers, passport and driver license information. Our forensic investigation has been concluded and we believe we have reasonably determined the scope of the incident. Individuals affected by this incident were sent formal notification in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. The cost of investigating and resolving the incident has been immaterial. Based on what management and the Companys third-party cyber security experts have determined in their investigation, the Company also does not foresee this incident having any future material detrimental effect on our business or financial position. The Company has in place cyber liability insurance coverage, subject to certain policy limitations and deductibles. The Company had also immediately notified the cyber insurance carrier of the network security incident, who worked with management and the Companys third-party cyber security experts on this matter.\nThe Companys network environment is fully operational and additional security measures have been added and/or are being evaluated to prevent further intrusions. The Company has not observed any additional malicious activity on the network to date. The Companys operations were only minimally impacted by the incident, and we were able to serve our clients and other stakeholders without issue throughout.\nOUR STRATEGY OF GROWING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS MAY BE IMPEDED BY A LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS.\nWe intend to expand our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, subject to our business plans and managements ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition or investment targets in both new and existing service categories. In certain circumstances, acceptable acquisition or investment targets might not be available. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty maintaining the quality of services that such acquired companies have historically provided;\n\u00b7\nimpact of liabilities of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single supplier or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition;\n\u00b7\nimpacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus increasing debt leverage and reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives;\n\u00b7\ninternal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies may be inadequate or ineffective;\n\u00b7\noverpayment for the acquired company or assets or failure to achieve anticipated benefits, such as cost savings (synergies) and revenue enhancements;\n\u00b7\nincreased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in implementing uniform standards, accounting policies, customs, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nfailure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; and\n\u00b7\nloss of customers and a failure to integrate and retain customer bases.\nIn addition, if we incur indebtedness to finance an acquisition, it may reduce our capacity to borrow additional amounts and requiring us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the cash resources available to us to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and meet general corporate and working capital needs. This increased indebtedness may also limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry.\nThe use of our common stock or other securities (including those that might be convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock) to finance any such acquisition may also result in dilution of our existing shareholders.\nThe potential risks associated with recent and future acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, result in the loss of key customers or personnel, increase expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWE MAY BE EXPOSED TO EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to:\n\u00b7\ndiscrimination and harassment;\n\u00b7\nwrongful termination or denial of employment;\n\u00b7\nviolations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u00b7\nclassification of temporary workers;\n\u00b7\nassignment of illegal aliens;\n\u00b7\nviolations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u00b7\nretroactive entitlement to temporary worker benefits;\n\u00b7\nerrors and omissions by our temporary workers;\n\u00b7\nrelease, misuse or appropriation of client intellectual property, or other confidential or other property or proprietary information;\n\u00b7\nmisappropriation of funds;\n\u00b7\ncybersecurity breaches affecting our clients and/or us;\n\u00b7\ndamage to customer facilities due to negligence of temporary workers; and\n\u00b7\ncriminal misconduct or illegal activity by our temporary workers.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems and claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nWE FACE SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LEGAL RISK.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property; cyber security breaches affecting our clients and/or us; discrimination and harassment claims; employment of illegal aliens; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, civil litigation, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business.\nOUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR NET OPERATING CARRYFORWARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX ATTRIBUTES MAY BE LIMITED.\nFederal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 382). Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect five percent shareholders increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically, three years).\nUnder Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporations ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation as defined in Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change. In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT TO DECLINE. A MORE ACTIVE, LIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NOT DEVELOP, AND THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. The securities markets have experienced significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently, significant inflation, rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and volatility and uncertainty in our labor market. Market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we cannot assure you that an active public market will develop for our common stock. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a shareholders ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if the relatively limited trading volumes for our stock persists, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without large enough trading volumes, our common stock may be expected to remain less liquid than the stock of other more actively traded companies and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour quarterly or annual operating results and financial position;\n\u00b7\nadverse market reaction to changes in our indebtedness, if any;\n\u00b7\nthe perceived impact of the present uncertainties in the economy and labor markets on our industry and our own results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and government investigations;\n\u00b7\npending acquisitions, if any;\n\u00b7\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts projections;\n\u00b7\nfuture changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement of laws or regulations affecting our business.\nIn response, the market price of shares of our common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of common stock at or above the public offering price.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.\nOUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE DELISTED FROM THE NYSE AMERICAN IF WE DO NOT MEET ITS CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENTS.\nThe NYSE American has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the NYSE American. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these standards in the future to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American. Factors that could have an impact on our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on NYSE American include the status of the market for our common stock at the time, our reported results of operations in future periods, and general economic, market and industry conditions.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, our common stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. In the event that we are not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for shareholders to sell their common stock. Moreover, if we are delisted from the NYSE American, but obtain a substitute listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on the NYSE American. Shareholders may not be able to sell their common stock on any such substitute. market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the price of our common stock is likely to decline. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE American could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, or employees.\nWE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK; AS A RESULT, YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT UNLESS YOU SELL YOUR COMMON STOCK FOR A PRICE GREATER THAN THAT WHICH YOU PAID FOR IT.\nWe intend to retain a substantial portion of future earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. We are presently repurchasing our own common shares in the open market, under authorization of our board of directors and in accordance with applicable Federal and state laws, regulations and rules. However, any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws. It will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of our debt financing arrangements, and any future debt financing arrangement likely will contain terms restricting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nTHERE MAY BE FUTURE SALES OF OUR SECURITIES OR OTHER DILUTION OF OUR EQUITY, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nWe have experienced losses from operations and negative operating cash flow in the past and have an accumulated deficit. We have had to raise additional funds in order to deleverage, recapitalize and finance our current operations and may have to in the future if we are unable to sustain our current operations and results. If additional capital is not available to us when and if needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may be expected to dilute our shareholders ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nIf we are unable to secure additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our operations, dispose of technology or assets, pursue an acquisition of our company by a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our shareholders, file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and increased risk of insolvency and up to a total loss of investment by our shareholders.\nPROVISIONS IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS, AS AMENDED AND ILLINOIS LAW MIGHT DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY OR CHANGES IN OUR MANAGEMENT AND, THEREFORE, DEPRESS THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nProvisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated by-laws, as amended, and Illinois law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders. Special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, our president, a majority of the members of the board of directors, or by one or more shareholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 20% of the votes at the special meeting;\n\u00b7\nestablishing a staggered board of directors. Our board is divided into three classes, each of which shall serve for a term of three years, with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u00b7\nrequiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our shareholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions pursuant to the Illinois Business Corporation Act (the IBCA) that prohibit a publicly held Illinois corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a shareholder becoming an interested shareholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally, an interested shareholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own) 15% or more of a corporations voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our stock.\nThe existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nIF SECURITIES OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS DO NOT PUBLISH OR CEASE PUBLISHING RESEARCH OR REPORTS ABOUT US, OUR BUSINESS OR OUR MARKET, OR IF THEY CHANGE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING OUR STOCK ADVERSELY, OUR STOCK PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME COULD DECLINE.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA POSSIBLE SHORT SQUEEZE DUE TO A SUDDEN INCREASE IN DEMAND OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT LARGELY EXCEEDS SUPPLY MAY LEAD TO FURTHER PRICE VOLATILITY IN OUR COMMON STOCK.\nInvestors may purchase our common stock to hedge existing exposure in our common stock or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional common shares to cover their short position. This is referred to as a short squeeze in lay terms. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our company and once investors purchase the shares of common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our common stock may decline.\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY MAY STRAIN OUR FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND DISTRACT MANAGEMENT.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). These requirements are extensive. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements. These applicable rules and regulations significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly than privately owned companies that are not SEC registrants. This also may divert managements attention from other business concerns, which must be balanced so as not to cause material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also believe compliance risks associated with these rules and regulations tend to make it more difficult and expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance and could result in our need to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nAdditionally, shareholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CURRENT AND POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC rules require that our management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, our management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While we are not aware of any material weaknesses, we cannot assure you that one or more will not be identified in the future.\nAny failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nTHERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR AND NOT BE DETECTED.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our future debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.\nOUR OPERATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS.\nCustomers demand for our services may fluctuate widely with changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Those conditions include slower employment growth or reductions in employment, which directly impact our service offerings. As a staffing company, our revenue depends on the number of jobs we fill, which in turn depends on economic growth. During economic slowdowns, many customer companies stop hiring altogether. For example, in prior economic downturns, many employers in our operating regions reduced their overall workforce to reflect the slowing demand for their products and services. We may face lower demand and increased pricing pressures during these periods, which this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nINTERRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS COULD RESULT FROM INCREASED SECURITY MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM OR CIVIL UNREST.\nThe continued threat of terrorism within the United States and the ongoing military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat has and may cause significant disruption to commerce. The U.S. economy, in general, is being adversely affected by terrorist activities and the potential activities for terrorist activities or other civil unrest. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow the business. It is impossible to predict how this may affect our business or the economy in the U.S. and in the world. In the event of further threats or acts of terrorism or civil unrest, our business and operations may be further severely and adversely affected.\nOUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLEMENT WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS.\nWar, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to commerce and the economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers. Two wars are now being waged at the global level, the first led by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the second, following the recent invasion of Israel by Hamas terrorists. These and continuing overtures by China over Taiwan and the South China Sea, also add instability to the uncertainty driving socioeconomic forces, which in turn, impact the Companys and its subsidiaries operations. Our business operations also are subject to interruption by, among others, inclement weather, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our services.\nOUR COMPLIANCE WITH COMPLICATED REGULATIONS CONCERNING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES.\nWe are faced with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. New standards are developing concerning environmental, social and governance matters (ESG) and other emerging socioeconomic trends and matters. In addition, as a staffing company, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing compliance work.\nOur failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nFINANCIAL CHALLENGES AT OTHER BANKING INSTITUTIONS COULD LEAD TO DEPOSITOR CONCERNS THAT SPREAD WITHIN THE BANKING INDUSTRY CAUSING DISRUPTIVE DEPOSIT OUTFLOWS AND OTHER DESTABILIZING RESULTS.\nIn March and April 2023, certain specialized banking institutions with elevated concentrations of uninsured deposits experienced large deposit outflows coupled with insufficient liquidity to meet withdrawal demands, resulting in the institutions being placed into Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receiverships. In the aftermath, there has been market disruption and indications that diminished depositor confidence could spread across the banking industry, leading to deposit outflows and other destabilizing results. The Federal Reserve Board announced that it would provide funding to ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of their depositors, but there can be no assurance whether such funding will be adequate to fully address these issues. The Company currently has bank deposits with financial institutions in the U.S. that exceed FDIC insurance limits. However, the Company has taken measures to diversify its deposit base, that are intended to mitigate and minimize its potential exposure to losses as a result of maintaining cash deposits in accounts that exceed FDIC insurance limits. Among these, during fiscal 2023, the Company established, and initially deposited $13 million of its excess cash, under a brokerage arrangement with a major financial advisory institution that manages and deposits these funds under a specialized program whereby the funds are allocated among FDIC insured banks in amounts that individually do not exceed the established FDIC insured limit of $250 thousand. To date, the Company has not experienced any material loss as a result of the failure of any financial institution in which it has funds or other assets on deposit. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties.\nThe Companys policy is to lease (rather than purchase) commercial office space for all of its offices. The Companys headquarters are located with one of its branch locations in Jacksonville Florida, for which the applicable lease expires in 2026.\nThe Company markets its services using the trade names General Employment Enterprises, Omni One, Ashley Ellis, Agile Resources, Scribe Solutions Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Paladin Consulting Inc., SNI Companies, Accounting Now, Staffing Now\u00ae, SNI Banking, SNI Certes\u00ae, SNI Energy\u00ae, SNI Financial\u00ae, SNI Technology\u00ae, Triad Personnel Services and Triad Staffing. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely. We have offices or serve markets remotely, as follows; (i) one office in each of Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Jersey, and one remote local market presence in Virginia; (ii) two offices each in Georgia and Massachusetts; (iii) three offices in Colorado; (iv) two offices and two additional local market presences in Texas; (v) six offices and one additional local market presence in Florida; and (vi) seven offices in Ohio.\nEstablished offices are operated from leased spaces ranging from 800 to 7,500 square feet, and generally for initial lease periods of one to seven years, with cancellation clauses after certain periods of occupancy in some cases. Management believes that existing facilities are adequate for the Companys current needs and that its leasing strategies provide the Company with sufficient flexibility to open or close offices to accommodate business needs.\nAs the Companys leases for its existing offices near their expiration or renewal dates, the Company evaluates the continued necessity for maintaining the location, including consideration of matters ranging from whether they are in close proximity of other available service offices, proximity and importance of a local presence to existing clients and as a competitive advantage in the local market, the size and number of staff located there, whether staff have the means to work effectively on a remote basis supported by resources available from other larger locations, and other factors. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNone. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nThe Companys common stock is listed on the NYSE American and is traded under the symbol JOB.\nHolders of Record\nThere were 745 holders of record of the Companys common stock on September 30, 2023.\nDividends\nNo dividends were declared or paid during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn April 27, 2023, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of the Companys currently outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program will continue through December 31, 2023, may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any number of shares of common stock. The share repurchase program is being conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Subject to applicable rules and regulations, the shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time in the open market transactions and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business considerations. The Company has conducted repurchases consistently since the programs implementation and intends to continue to take advantage of the present attractive market prices for its common stock.\nOur purchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows:\nPeriod\nTotal\nNumber of\nShares\nPurchased\nAverage\nPrice Paid\nPer Share\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased as\nPart of Publicly Announced\nProgram\nDollar Value of\nShares that May Yet\nBe Purchased Under\nthe Program (a)\nJuly 1, 2023 - July 31, 2023\n584,098\n$ 0.51\n584,098\n$ 19,245,696\nAugust 1, 2023 - August 31, 2023\n809,371\n0.60\n809,371\n18,762,928\nSeptember 1, 2023 - September 30, 2023\n1,147,615\n0.59\n1,147,615\n18,084,617\n2,541,084\n2,541,084\n(a)\nExcludes brokerage commissions paid by the Company.\nAs of December 15, 2023, the Company has repurchased 5,808,053 shares of its common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program (accounting for approximately 5.1% of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately prior to the program).\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were stock options outstanding under the Companys Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Plan. The plan granted specified numbers of options to non-employee directors, and they authorized the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant either restricted stock and incentive or non-statutory stock options to employees. Effective July 13, 2022, the tenth anniversary of the Plan, incentive stock options are no longer eligible to be granted. Vesting periods are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. All stock options outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were non-qualified stock options, had exercise prices equal to the market price on the date of grant, and had expiration dates ten years from the date of grant. The maximum number of shares that may be granted under the 2013 Plan is 15 million (7,500 thousand for restricted stock grants and 7,500 thousand for stock option grants). This number is subject to adjustment to reflect changes in the capital structure or organization of the Company.\nPlan category\nNumber of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights\nWeighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights\nNumber of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in first column)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders\n5,317,644\n$ 1.03\n7,782,356\nTotal\n5,317,644\n$ 1.03\n7,782,356 Item 6. [Reserved]. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagements discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future performance. However, future performance involves risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Item 7 should be read in conjunction with the information contained in Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report and with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. References such as the Company, we, our and us refer to GEE Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nGEE Group Inc. and its wholly owned material operating subsidiaries, Access Data Consulting Corporation, Agile Resources, Inc., BMCH, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Logistics, Inc., and Triad Personnel Services, Inc. are providers of permanent and temporary professional and industrial staffing and placement services in and near several major U.S cities. We specialize in the placement of information technology, accounting, finance, office, and engineering professionals for direct hire and contract staffing for our clients, data entry assistants (medical scribes) who specialize in electronic medical records (EMR) services for emergency departments, specialty physician practices and clinics, and provide temporary staffing services for our industrial clients. The acquisitions of Scribe Solutions, Inc., a Florida corporation (Scribe) in April 2015, Agile Resources, Inc., a Georgia corporation (Agile) in July 2015, Access Data Consulting Corporation, a Colorado corporation (Access) in October 2015, Paladin Consulting Inc. (Paladin) in January 2016, and SNI Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (SNI) in April 2017, expanded our geographical footprint within the professional placement and contract staffing verticals or end markets of information technology, accounting, finance, office, engineering professionals, and medical scribes.\nThe Company markets its services using the trade names General Employment Enterprises, Omni One, Ashley Ellis, Agile Resources, Scribe Solutions Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Paladin Consulting Inc., SNI Companies (including Staffing Now, Accounting Now, and Certes), Triad Personnel Services and Triad Staffing. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely. We have offices or serve markets remotely, as follows; (i) one office in each of Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Jersey, and one remote local market presence in Virginia; (ii) two offices each in Georgia and Massachusetts; (iii) three offices in Colorado; (iv) two offices and two additional local market presences in Texas; (v) six offices and one additional local market presence in Florida; and (vi) seven offices in Ohio.\nManagement has implemented a strategy which includes organic and acquisition growth components. Managements organic growth strategy includes seeking out and winning new client business, as well as expansion of existing client business and on-going cost reduction and productivity improvement efforts in operations. Managements acquisition growth strategy includes identifying strategic, accretive acquisitions, financed primarily through a combination of cash and debt, including seller financing, the issuance of equity in appropriate circumstances, and the use of earn-outs where efficient to improve the overall profitability and cash flows of the Company.\nThe Companys contract and placement services are principally provided under two operating divisions or segments: Professional Staffing Services and Industrial Staffing Services. We believe our current segments and array of businesses and brands within our segments complement one another and position us for future growth.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nResults of Operations\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (fiscal 2023), and fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (fiscal 2022)\nSummary and Outlook\nFiscal 2023 results declined from those of fiscal 2022, as expected, primarily as the result of economic and labor market uncertainties and instability, which negatively impacted the numbers of orders and candidates available to fill orders across our businesses. Fiscal 2022 also was an above average year in terms of performance, and while fiscal 2023 results were lower overall, the Company once again was profitable and generated positive cash flow from operations, as it has consistently done since completion of the significant deleveraging initiatives and a follow-on offering during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. We also believe our top line performance was in line with our industry peers and above average in regards to our IT brands. Our lowest performing businesses continued to be those serving light industrial and office clerical markets. We are cautiously optimistic about our ability to return to growth once again, and especially in our largest professional services businesses, led by IT, as uncertainties and unknowns about the economy and labor environments lessen.\nWe experienced twelve quarters of cumulative pre-tax income during our fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023, for purposes of evaluation of our deferred income tax valuation allowance, which had been set at 100% of our net deferred tax assets. As a result of this and our evaluations of other positive and negative evidence, we have recognized a net deferred tax benefit of $7,249 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which accounted for approximately $0.06 of this periods earnings per share. The reversal of this allowance during fiscal 2023 represented a significant milestone and indication of our progress.\nWe also implemented a $20 million share repurchase program during fiscal 2023, providing a means to return excess capital to our shareholders from our growing cash balances. As of September 30, 2023, we had repurchased 3,411 shares. As of December 15, 2023, the Company has repurchased 5,808 shares (accounting for approximately 5.1% of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately prior to the program). The Company has conducted repurchases consistently since the programs implementation and intends to continue to take advantage of the present attractive market prices for its common shares.\nNet Revenues\nConsolidated net revenues are comprised of the following:\nFiscal\n$ Change\n% Change\nProfessional contract services\n$ 120,046\n$ 122,562\n$ (2,516 )\n(2)%\nIndustrial contract services\n13,005\n15,945\n(2,940 )\n(18)%\nTotal contract services revenues\n133,051\n138,507\n(5,456 )\n(4)%\nDirect hire placement services\n19,392\n26,605\n(7,213 )\n(27)%\nConsolidated net revenues\n$ 152,443\n165,112\n$ (12,669 )\n(8)%\nContract staffing services contributed $133,051, or approximately 87%, of consolidated revenue and direct hire placement services contributed $19,392, or approximately 13%, of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2023. This compares to contract staffing services revenue of $138,507, or approximately 84%, of consolidated revenue and direct hire placement revenue of $26,605, or approximately 16%, of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2022.\nAs a result of the economic headwinds encountered during fiscal 2023, including persistent inflation and threats of recession, consolidated contract staffing services revenues for fiscal 2023 were down only $5,456, or 4%, when compared to fiscal 2022. Professional contract services revenue decreased by $2,516, or 2%, which can be attributed to completion of certain discreet (non-recurring) projects in fiscal 2022, including professional staffing support provided to former COVID-19 response vaccination and testing facilities. These discreet projects generated $3,152 in revenue during fiscal 2022. Excluding the effects of these discreet projects, professional contract services revenues would have increased $636, or 0.5%, during fiscal 2023. Industrial staffing services revenues decreased by $2,940, or 18%, mainly due to a decrease in orders from clients. Our industrial staffing markets in Ohio, as well as office clerical markets in various locations, continue to be affected by workforce volatility following COVID-19, resulting in more competition for orders and temporary labor to fill orders. According to a U.S. Staffing Industry Forecast report published in September 2023 by Staffing Industry Analysts, U.S. staffing industry revenues are expected to decline 10% over the 2023 calendar year.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nDirect hire placement revenue for fiscal 2023 decreased by $7,213, or 27%, over fiscal 2022. Direct hire opportunities tend to be highly cyclical and demand dependent, tending to rise during economic recovery and decline during downturns. Demand for the Companys direct hire services in fiscal 2022 was extraordinarily high driven by post-COVID employment recovery trends, and is down in 2023 on the presence of economic uncertainties . Management believes that the Companys direct hire performance during fiscal 2023 was on par with larger employment and industry trends.\nCost of Contract Services\nCost of contract services includes wages and related payroll taxes, employee benefits of the Company's contract services employees, and certain other employee-related costs, while they work on contract assignments. Cost of contract services for fiscal 2023 decreased by approximately 4% to $99,571 compared to $103,434 for fiscal 2022. The $3,863 decrease in cost of contract services is consistent with the decrease in revenues as discussed above.\nGross Profit percentage by service:\nFiscal\nProfessional contract services\n26.1%\n26.6%\nIndustrial contract services\n16.5%\n15.4%\nConsolidated contract services\n25.2%\n25.3%\nDirect hire placement services (1)\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCombined gross profit margin (1)\n34.7%\n37.4%\n(1)\nIncludes gross profit from direct hire placements, for which all associated costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Companys combined gross profit margin, including direct hire placement services (recorded at 100% gross margin) for fiscal 2023 was approximately 34.7% versus approximately 37.4% for fiscal 2022. The substantial portion of the decline in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, is due to the corresponding declines in the volume and mix of direct hire placement revenues in fiscal 2023.\nIn the professional contract staffing services segment, the gross margin excluding direct placement services was approximately 26.1% for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 26.6% for fiscal 2022. This decrease is due in part to increases in contractor pay associated with the recent rise in inflation resulting in some margin compression. The Company stepped-up counter-inflationary measures during the second half of fiscal 2023, including seeking increases in bill rates and spreads, where possible, to address margin compression.\nThe Companys industrial staffing services gross margin for fiscal 2023 was approximately 16.5% as compared with approximately 15.4% for fiscal 2022. This increase is mainly attributable to price increases enacted to offset increases in contractor payroll and achieve higher spreads in the Industrial segment.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include the following categories:\n\u00b7\nCompensation and benefits in the operating divisions, which includes salaries, wages and commissions earned by the Companys employment consultants, recruiters and branch managers on permanent and temporary placements;\n\u00b7\nAdministrative compensation, which includes salaries, wages, share-based compensation, payroll taxes and employee benefits associated with general management and the operation of corporate functions, including principally, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative functions;\n\u00b7\nOccupancy costs, which includes office rent, and other office operating expenses;\n\u00b7\nRecruitment advertising, which includes the cost of identifying and tracking job applicants; and\n\u00b7\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes travel, bad debt expense, fees for outside professional services and other corporate-level expenses such as business insurance and taxes.\nThe Companys SG&A for fiscal 2023 decreased by $4,336 as compared to fiscal 2022. SG&A for fiscal 2023 as a percentage of revenue was approximately 31.2% versus 31.4% for fiscal 2022. The decrease in SG&A relative to revenue, despite the effects of inflation on compensation and other operating costs, is largely a result of certain cost reductions implemented by the Company during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. These cost reductions were expected to provide annual savings of approximately $4.0 million. The Company monitors operating costs including the impacts of inflation with a view towards identifying and taking advantage of potential cost reductions on a routine basis.\nSG&A includes certain non-cash costs and expenses incurred related to acquisition, integration and restructuring and other non-recurring activities, such as certain corporate legal and general expenses associated with capital markets activities that either are not directly associated with core business operations or have been eliminated on a going forward basis. These costs were $838 and $2,060 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and include mainly expenses associated with former closed and consolidated locations, legal fees and a settlement, and personnel costs associated with eliminated positions.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation expense was $383 and $371 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense is due to recent net additions to fixed assets. Amortization expense was $2,879, and $3,469 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease is due to intangible assets related to certain non-compete agreements and trade names becoming fully amortized.\nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2023 and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. During fiscal 2022, as of December 31, 2021, an interim assessment was performed as the amount of discount inherent in the Companys market capitalization as reported on the NYSE American exchange when compared with consolidated stockholders equity, or net book value, had increased since the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2021. The estimated fair values of its Professional Services and Industrial Services reporting units were adjusted based on qualitative and quantitative analysis so that they reconciled more precisely with the Companys market capitalization as of December 31, 2021, plus an assumed control premium. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2,150 during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Upon completion of the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2022, it was determined that the Companys goodwill was not impaired.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations was $2,033 and $3,775 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. This decrease of $1,742 is consistent with the decrease in revenues, mainly in direct hire placements, as discussed above, and taking into account the goodwill impairment charge of $2,150 included in fiscal 2022 income from operations.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased by $41 to $336 for fiscal 2023 from $377 for fiscal 2022.\nInterest Income\nThe Company began holding excess cash in interest bearing accounts in August 2022 on which interest income earned was $472 and $16 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company recognized income tax benefits (expense) of $7,249 and $(588) for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rates for fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the change in valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset (DTA) position.\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As of June 30, 2023, in part due to the fact that in the current year we achieved three years of cumulative pretax income, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes are realizable. As a result, the Company released $7,581 of the valuation allowance accordingly during fiscal 2023.\nNet Income\nThe Companys net income was $9,418 and $19,599 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition to the changes in income from operations as outlined above, the decrease is primarily due to gains of $16,773 recorded in fiscal 2022 from forgiveness and extinguishment of the Companys remaining PPP loans, offset by the deferred tax benefit of $7,249 during fiscal 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of liquidity for the Company are revenues earned and collected from its clients and borrowings available under its asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility. Uses of liquidity include primarily the costs and expenses necessary to fund operations, including payment of compensation to the Companys contract and permanent employees, employment-related expenses, operating costs and expenses, taxes and capital expenditures.\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flows data:\nFiscal\nCash flows provided by operating activities\n$ 5,890\n$ 9,396\nCash flows used in investing activities\n(89 )\n(328 )\nCash flows used in financing activities\n(2,178 )\n(167 )\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had $22,471 of cash which was an increase of $3,623 from $18,848 as of September 30, 2022. The Company reported $5,890 and $9,396 in cash flow from operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had working capital of $30,290 compared to $26,643 as of September 30, 2022. The increase in working capital is mainly attributable to positive cash flow from operations less purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2023. Cash flows were reduced by installment payments of deferred payroll taxes under the CARES Act from fiscal 2020, of $1,847 each, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe primary uses of cash for investing activities were for the acquisition of property and equipment, principally information technology equipment, during fiscal 2023 and 2022.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe cash flows used in financing activities were for purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2023, and payments made on finance leases during fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company had approximately $11,251 in availability for borrowings under its CIT facility as of September 30, 2023. There were no outstanding borrowings on the CIT Facility as of September 30, 2023, or September 30, 2022, except for certain accrued carrying fees and costs, which are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOn April 27, 2023, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of the Companys currently outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program will continue through December 31, 2023, may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any number of shares of common stock. The share repurchase program is to be conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Subject to applicable rules and regulations, the shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time in the open market transactions and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business considerations. During fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 3,411 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1,984.\nAs of December 15, 2023, the Company has repurchased 5,808 shares (accounting for approximately 5.1% of our issued and outstanding common shares immediately prior to the program).\nAll the Companys office facilities are leased. Minimum lease payments under all the Companys lease agreements for the twelve-month period commencing after the close of business on September 30, 2023, are approximately $1,669. There are no minimum debt service principal payments due during the twelve-month period commencing after the close of business on September 30, 2023.\nManagement believes that the Company can generate adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future and at least for the next twelve months after the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2023, and 2022, and during the two fiscal years then ended, there were no transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity was a party, under which the Company (a) had any direct or contingent obligation under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest in the unconsolidated entity, or (b) had a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nManagement makes estimates and assumptions that can affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the amounts of reported revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Those estimates and assumptions typically involve expectations about events to occur subsequent to the balance sheet date, and it is possible that actual results could ultimately differ from the estimates. If differences were to occur in a subsequent period, the Company would recognize those differences when they became known.\nSignificant accounting and disclosure matters requiring the use of estimates and assumptions include, but may not be limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, determining fair values of financial assets and liabilities, income tax provisions and benefits, including deferred income tax valuation allowances, accounting for asset impairments, and accounting for share-based compensation. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based on information that is available at the time they are made.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe following accounting policies are considered by management to be critical because of the judgments and uncertainties involved, and because different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are recognized when promised services are performed for customers, and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of variable consideration such as sales adjustments or allowances. Direct hire placement service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of employment, less a provision for estimated credits or refunds to customers as the result of applicants not remaining employed for the entirety of the Company's guarantee period (referred to as falloffs). The Companys guarantee periods for permanently placed employees generally range from 60 to 90 days from the date of hire.\nFalloffs and refunds during the period, including estimates for future falloffs associated with revenues that have been recognized, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of placement service revenues and in the consolidated balance sheets, in combination with allowance for uncollectible accounts, as a reduction of accounts receivable. Estimated future falloffs are determined by analyzing recent historical trends of actual falloffs and applying a formula comprised of average numbers of falloffs, average falloff amounts, and average cycle times between billing and fall off dates to derive an allowance for falloffs. Thus, the estimated allowance is derived from observed trends in actual historical falloffs and assumes that historical trends are indicative of future falloff activity.\nTemporary staffing service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized in amounts for which the Company has a right to invoice, as the services are rendered by the Companys temporary employees. The Company records temporary staffing revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent in the presentation of revenues and expenses. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because the Company controls the specified service before that service is performed for a customer. The Company has the risk of identifying and hiring qualified employees, has the discretion to select the employees and establish their price, and bears the risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company extends credit to its various customers based on evaluation of the customers financial condition and ability to pay the Company in accordance with the payment terms. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded, as a charge to bad debt expense, where collection is considered to be doubtful due to credit issues. An allowance for placement falloffs is recorded, as a reduction of revenues, for estimated losses due to applicants not remaining employed for the Companys guarantee period. These allowances together reflect managements estimate of the potential losses inherent in the accounts receivable balances, based on historical loss statistics and known factors impacting its customers. Management believes that the nature of the contract service business, wherein client companies are generally dependent on our contract employees in the same manner as permanent employees for their production cycles and the conduct of their respective businesses contributes to a relatively small accounts receivable allowance.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. Under these provisions, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Companys assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances when observable inputs are not available. The hierarchy is described below:\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it is believed these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In the event it is determined that the Company would not be able to realize the entire amount of recorded deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nInterest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits are recognized on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, no accrued interest or penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nGoodwill\nThe Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment as prescribed by FASB ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, at least annually and on an interim basis when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill.\nThe Company performed annual goodwill impairment testing effective as of September 30, 2023, and allocated its goodwill among two reporting units: its professional reporting unit and its industrial reporting unit for purposes of evaluation for impairments. In determining the fair value of our two reporting units, we use one or a combination of commonly accepted valuation methodologies: (1) the income approach, which is based on the present value of discounted cash flows projected for the reporting unit or, in certain instances, capitalization of earnings, and (2) the market approach, which estimates a fair value based on an appropriate revenue and/or earnings multiple(s) derived from comparable companies. These valuation techniques rely upon assumptions and other factors, such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units, the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows, and the market multiples of comparable companies utilized. In applying our methods, we consider and use averages and medians in the selection of assumptions derived from comparable companies or market data, where applicable, and in the application of the income and/or market approaches if we determine that this will provide a more appropriate estimated fair value or range of fair value estimates of the reporting units. Changes to input assumptions and other factors used or considered in the analysis could result in materially different evaluations of goodwill impairment.\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nFor purposes of performing this goodwill impairment assessment, management applied the valuation techniques and assumptions to its professional and industrial segments as reporting units discussed above; and also considered recent trends in the Companys stock price, implied control or acquisition premiums, earnings, and other possible factors and their effects on estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units.\nAs a result of the evaluation performed, the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying values of its net assets of the Companys professional and industrial reporting units as of September 30, 2023.\nIntangible Assets\nSeparately identifiable intangible assets held in the form of customer relationships and trade names were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years using both accelerated and straight-line methods.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets (other than Goodwill)\nThe Company recognizes an impairment of long-lived intangible assets used in operations, other than goodwill, when events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their remaining lives are less than the carrying amount of those items. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value, which is typically calculated using the discounted cash flow method. For purposes of testing the long-lived assets other than goodwill, long-lived assets are grouped and considered with other assets and liabilities within the professional and industrial reporting units. The Company did not record any impairments to its long-lived assets during fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options or restricted stock grants. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton (\"Black-Scholes\") pricing model. For all employee stock options and restricted stock grants, the Company recognizes expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant) and records an estimate for forfeitures. The Company's option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, and expected term. Any changes in these subjective assumptions significantly impact our share-based compensation expense.\nSee Note 10 for the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share-based employee and non-employee compensation. Upon the exercise of options, it is the Company's policy to issue new shares rather than utilizing treasury shares.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNot Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), which enhances prior reportable segment disclosure requirements in part by requiring entities to disclose significant expenses related to their reportable segments. The guidance also requires disclosure of the Chief Operating Decision Maker's (CODM) position for each segment and detail of how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segments performance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not expect implementation of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, authoritative guidance amending how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance requires the application of a current expected credit loss model, which is a new impairment model based on expected losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect implementation of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNo other recent accounting pronouncements were issued by FASB and the SEC that are believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Companys goodwill was $61.3 million. As discussed in Notes 2 and 6 of the financial statements, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, as of September 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performed a Step 1 analysis as of September 30, 2023, for the Companys annual impairment test, and the analysis noted no impairment of goodwill as of such date. The Companys goodwill impairment analysis relies on assumptions and other factors, such as industry multiples applied to earnings, estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and market comparable assumptions.\nWe identified the goodwill impairment assessment as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination are the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in evaluating managements significant assumptions used in the impairment analyses, particularly as it relates to industry multiples applied to earnings, estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and market comparable assumptions.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u00b7\nObtained an understanding of managements process for developing fair value estimates.\n\u00b7\nTested the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the Companys analysis.\n\u00b7\nEvaluated the significant management assumptions utilized in the estimated future cash flows by comparing revenues and performance in managements forecast to periods incurred to-date subsequent to September 30, 2023, and assessed the forecasts of revenues and expenses and the gross margin impact in future periods.\n\u00b7\nUtilized personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in valuation to assist in: (i) assessing the appropriateness of the fair value methodology and estimation process, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions used including assessing the appropriateness of the discount rate, industry multiples, and the market comparable assumptions, and (iii) testing the mathematical accuracy and completeness of the discounted cash flow models and the impairment assessment analyses.\n/s/ FORVIS, LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nTampa, Florida\nDecember 18, 2023\nGEE GROUP INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in thousands)\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash\n$ 22,471\n$ 18,848\nAccounts receivable, less allowances ($680 and $738, respectively)\n18,333\n22,770\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nTotal current assets\n41,651\n42,222\nProperty and equipment, net\n1,140\nGoodwill\n61,293\n61,293\nIntangible assets, net\n8,406\n11,285\nDeferred tax assets, net\n7,064\n-\nRight-of-use assets\n3,637\n2,830\nOther long-term assets\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 123,493\n$ 119,554\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable\n$ 2,762\n$ 2,958\nAccrued compensation\n5,464\n5,750\nCurrent operating lease liabilities\n1,475\n1,333\nOther current liabilities\n1,660\n5,538\nTotal current liabilities\n11,361\n15,579\nDeferred tax liabilities, net\n-\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities\n2,470\n1,889\nOther long-term liabilities\nTotal liabilities\n14,192\n18,551\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 12)\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCommon stock, no-par value;

Description of Business\nGEE Group Inc. was incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1962 and is the successor to employment offices doing business since 1893. GEE Group Inc. and its wholly owned material operating subsidiaries, Access Data Consulting Corporation, Agile Resources, Inc., BMCH, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Logistics, Inc., and Triad Personnel Services, Inc. (collectively referred to as the Company, us, our or we) are providers of permanent and temporary professional and industrial staffing and placement services in and near several major U.S cities. We specialize in the placement of information technology, accounting, finance, office, engineering, and medical professionals for direct hire and contract staffing for our professional clients and provide temporary staffing services for our industrial clients.\nThe Company markets its services using the trade names General Employment Enterprises, Omni One, Ashley Ellis, Agile Resources, Scribe Solutions Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Paladin Consulting Inc., SNI Companies (including Staffing Now, Accounting Now, and Certes), Triad Personnel Services and Triad Staffing. As of September 30, 2023, we operated from locations in eleven (11) states, including twenty-six (26) branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities and four (4) additional U.S. locations utilizing local staff members working remotely.\nThe Companys fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of each year. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 refer to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLiquidity\nThe primary sources of liquidity for the Company are revenues earned and collected from its clients for the placement of contractors and permanent employment candidates and borrowings available under its asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility. Uses of liquidity include primarily the costs and expenses necessary to fund operations, including payment of compensation to the Companys contract and permanent employees, payment of operating costs and expenses, payment to lessors, payment of taxes, payment of interest, fees and principal under its debt agreements, if any, purchases of treasury stock, and capital expenditures.\nManagement believes that the Company has adequate cash and working capital and can generate adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future and at least for one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for financial information and with the instructions to Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years consolidated financial statements and/or related disclosures to conform to the current years presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from contracts with customers are generated from direct hire placement services, professional contract services, and industrial contract services. Revenues are recognized when promised services are performed for customers, and in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Our revenues are recorded net of variable consideration such as sales adjustments or allowances. Payment terms in our contracts vary by the type and location of our customer and the services offered. The terms between invoicing and when payments are due are not significant.\nDirect hire placement service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of employment, less a provision for estimated credits or refunds to customers as the result of applicants not remaining employed for the entirety of the Companys guarantee period (referred to as falloffs). The Companys guarantee periods for permanently placed employees generally range from 60 to 90 days from the date of hire. Fees associated with candidate placement are generally calculated as a percentage of the new employees annual compensation. No fees for permanent placement services are charged to employment candidates.\nTemporary staffing service revenues from contracts with customers are recognized in amounts the Company has a right to invoice as the services are rendered by the Companys temporary employees. The Company records temporary staffing revenue on a gross basis rather than on a net basis as an agent in the presentation of revenues and expenses. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because the Company maintains primary responsibility for and controls the staff members that it provides to perform services for its clients. The Company has the risk of identifying and hiring qualified employees (as opposed to client employees), has the discretion to select the employees and establish their price, is responsible for compensating them, and bears the risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers.\nFalloffs and refunds during the period are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of placement service revenues and were approximately $943 in fiscal 2023 and $2,297 in fiscal 2022. Expected future falloffs and refunds are estimated and reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of accounts receivable as described under Accounts Receivable, below.\nSee Note 14 for disaggregated revenues by segment.\nCost of Contract Staffing Services\nThe cost of contract services includes the wages and the related payroll taxes, employee benefits and certain other employee-related costs of the Companys contract service employees while they work on contract assignments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nHighly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, there were no cash equivalents.\nCash deposit accounts are maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits guaranteed by the FDIC. During 2023, the Company entered into an enhanced deposit arrangement with a financial institution in which monies are deposited through a brokerage account and are further placed on deposit by the broker amongst U.S. banks pre-screened by the broker in amounts per bank that do not exceed the individual $250 FDIC per depositor limit. The aggregate amount of all funds on deposit under this program was $13,298 as of September 30, 2023. We have never experienced any material losses related to cash on deposit with banks.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company extends credit to its various customers based on evaluation of the customers financial condition and ability to pay the Company in accordance with the payment terms. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a charge to bad debt expense where collection is considered to be doubtful due to credit issues. The Company charges off uncollectible accounts against the allowance once the invoices are deemed unlikely to be collectible. An allowance for placement falloffs is also recorded as a reduction of revenues for estimated losses due to applicants not remaining employed for the Companys guarantee period. These allowances together reflect managements estimate of the potential losses inherent in the accounts receivable balances, based on historical loss statistics and known factors impacting its customers. Management believes that the nature of the contract service business, wherein client companies are generally dependent on our contract employees in the same manner as permanent employees for their production cycles and the conduct of their respective businesses contributes to a relatively small accounts receivable allowance.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the combined allowance for doubtful accounts and falloffs were $680 and $738, respectively. The allowance consists of $562 and $548 for doubtful accounts and $118 and $190 for falloffs as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is calculated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of five years for computer equipment and two to ten years for office equipment, furniture and fixtures. Depreciation expense for leasehold improvements is also calculated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the corresponding lease terms, which generally range from three to five years. The Company capitalizes computer software purchased or developed for internal use and amortizes it over an estimated useful life of five years. The carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset group is greater than its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. There was no impairment of property and equipment for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if a contractual arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, current operating lease liabilities, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company evaluates and classifies leases as operating or finance leases for financial reporting purposes. The classification is determined at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. All the Companys real estate leases are classified as operating leases. Also, the Company elected the practical expedient which allows aggregation of non-lease components with the related lease components when evaluating accounting treatment.\nROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease payments included in the present value are fixed lease payments. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on information available at the commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company applies the portfolio approach in applying discount rates to its classes of leases. The operating lease ROU assets include any payments made before the commencement date. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not currently have subleases. The Company does not currently have residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants in its leases.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nGoodwill\nThe Company evaluates its goodwill for possible impairment as prescribed by FASB ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Goodwill, at least annually, and more frequently when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired. Under this guidance, annual or interim goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company allocates its goodwill among two reporting units: its Professional Services reporting unit and its Industrial Services reporting unit for purposes of evaluation for impairments. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting units estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. In testing for impairments, management applies one or more valuation techniques to estimate the fair values of the reporting units, individual assets or groups of individual assets, as required under the circumstances. These valuation techniques rely on assumptions and other factors, such as industry multiples applied to earnings, estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and market comparable assumptions.\nIntangible Assets\nSeparately identifiable intangible assets held in the form of customer relationships and trade names were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years using both accelerated and straight-line methods.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets (other than Goodwill)\nThe Company recognizes an impairment of long-lived intangible assets used in operations, other than goodwill, when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their remaining lives are less than the carrying amount of those items. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value, which is typically calculated using the discounted cash flow method. For purposes of testing the long-lived assets other than goodwill, long-lived assets are grouped and considered with other assets and liabilities within the professional and industrial reporting units. The Company did not record any impairments to its long-lived assets during fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. Under these provisions, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Companys assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances when observable inputs are not available. The hierarchy is described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe fair values of the Companys current assets and current liabilities approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The carrying value disclosures of the Companys long-term liabilities approximate their respective fair values based on current yield for debt instruments with similar terms. The Company has no assets or liabilities which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurements utilized in evaluating the Companys goodwill and other intangible assets for impairments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period, which is computed using shares issued and outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of incremental shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted shares granted but unissued, exercise of stock options and warrants. The dilutive effect of the common stock equivalents is reflected in earnings per share by use of the treasury stock method.\nThe weighted average dilutive incremental shares, or common stock equivalents, included in the calculations of dilutive shares were 693 and 752 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Common stock equivalents, which are excluded because their effect is anti-dilutive, were approximately 3,786 and 942 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdvertising Expenses\nThe Company expenses the costs of print and internet media advertising and promotions as incurred and reports these costs in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense totaled $2,224 and $1,981 for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options or restricted stock grants. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton (\"Black-Scholes\") pricing model. For all employee stock options and restricted stock grants, the Company recognizes expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant) and records an estimate for forfeitures. The Company's option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, and expected term. Any changes in these subjective assumptions significantly impact our share-based compensation expense.\nSee Note 10 for the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share-based employee and non-employee compensation. Upon the exercise of options, it is the Company's policy to issue new shares rather than utilizing treasury shares.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it is believed these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In the event it is determined that the Company would not be able to realize the entire amount of recorded deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment would be made to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nInterest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits are recognized on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, no accrued interest or penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nNot Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), which enhances prior reportable segment disclosure requirements in part by requiring entities to disclose significant expenses related to their reportable segments. The guidance also requires disclosure of the Chief Operating Decision Maker's (CODM) position for each segment and detail of how the CODM uses financial reporting to assess their segments performance. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not expect implementation of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, authoritative guidance amending how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance requires the application of a current expected credit loss model, which is a new impairment model based on expected losses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. ASU 2016-13 became effective for the Company on October 1, 2023. The Company does not expect implementation of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNo other recent accounting pronouncements were issued by FASB and the SEC that are believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.\n4.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nFor purposes of performing its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company applied the valuation techniques and assumptions to its professional and industrial segments as reporting units discussed in Note 2, above; and also considered recent trends in the Companys stock price, implied control or acquisition premiums, earnings, and other possible factors and their effects on estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units.\nThe Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment, as of September 30, 2023, and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the amount of discount inherent in the Companys market capitalization as reported on the NYSE American exchange when compared with consolidated stockholders equity, or net book value, had increased since the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2021; therefore, the Company performed an interim assessment of its goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2021. The estimated fair values of its Professional Services and Industrial Services reporting units were adjusted based on qualitative and quantitative analysis so that they reconcile more precisely with the Companys market capitalization as of December 31, 2021, plus an assumed control premium. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2,150 during fiscal 2022.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following tables set forth the costs, accumulated amortization and net book value of the Companys separately identifiable intangible assets as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 and estimated future amortization expense.\nSeptember 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCost\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Book\nValue\nCost\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Book\nValue\nCustomer relationships\n$ 29,070\n$ (21,120 )\n$ 7,950\n$ 29,070\n$ (18,482 )\n$ 10,588\nTrade names\n8,329\n(7,873 )\n8,329\n(7,632 )\nTotal\n$ 37,399\n$ (28,993 )\n$ 8,406\n$ 37,399\n$ (26,114 )\n$ 11,285\nFiscal 2024\n$ 2,879\nFiscal 2025\n2,741\nFiscal 2026\n1,870\nFiscal 2027\n$ 8,406\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nIntangible assets that represent customer relationships are amortized on the basis of estimated future undiscounted cash flows or using the straight-line basis over estimated remaining useful lives of five to ten years. Trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives of between five and ten years.\n7. Accrued Compensation\nAccrued Compensation is comprised of accrued wages, the related payroll taxes, employee benefits accrued for the Company's employees, including those working on contract assignments, commissions earned and not yet paid and estimated commissions and bonuses payable.\n8. Senior Bank Loan, Security and Guarantee Agreement\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries entered a Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement for a $20 million asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility with CIT Bank, N.A. The CIT Facility is collateralized by 100% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries who are co-borrowers and/or guarantors. The CIT Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (May 14, 2026).\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings and $11,251 available for borrowing under the terms of the CIT Facility. The Company had $408 and $561 in unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the CIT Facility as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amortization expense of these debt costs totaled $153 in both fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nUnder the CIT Facility, advances will be subject to a borrowing base formula that is computed based on 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the Company and subsidiaries as defined in the CIT Facility, and subject to certain other criteria, conditions, and applicable reserves, including any additional eligibility requirements as determined by the administrative agent. The CIT Facility is subject to usual and customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type. The interest rate, at the Companys election, was based on either the Base Rate, as defined, plus the applicable margin; or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or any successor thereto, for the applicable interest period, subject to a 1% floor, plus the applicable margin. In addition to interest costs on advances outstanding, the CIT Facility will provide an unused line fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.50% depending on the amount of undrawn credit, original issue discount and certain fees for diligence, implementation, and administration. The unused line fees incurred and included in interest expense totaled $101 in both fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company entered into a Consent and Amendment No. 1 to the Loan and Security and Guarantee Agreement (Amendment No. 1), by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as Borrowers, the Guarantors, the financial institutions party to the agreement from time to time as the Lenders, and CIT Bank, a division of First-Citizen Bank & Trust Company (successor by merger to CIT Bank, N.A.), as Agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the terms of Amendment No. 1 and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Amendment No. 1, CIT and Lenders consented to the Companys previously announced 2023 Stock Repurchase Program (as defined in Amendment No. 1), which will continue through December 31, 2023; provided that (i) the aggregate amount paid for all such repurchase transactions shall not exceed $20 million, and (ii) no Default or Event of Default (as defined in Amendment No. 1) exists or would exist after giving effect to each repurchase transaction consummated thereunder. In addition, effective as of the date of Amendment No. 1, LIBOR is no longer used as a benchmark rate or otherwise operative within Amendment No. 1 and was replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as well as other conforming changes.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company and CIT Bank entered into Amendment No. 2 to the CIT Facility (Amendment No. 2). Amendment No. 2 provides for an increase in the CIT Facilitys concentration limits for certain large clients at the discretion of CIT Bank.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\n9. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) Payroll Protection Program Loans\nDuring April and May 2020, the Company obtained Payroll Protection Program loans (PPP loans) for each of its operating subsidiaries. The PPP loans were used primarily to restore employee pay-cuts, recall furloughed or laid-off employees, support the payroll costs for existing employees, hire new employees, and for other allowable purposes including interest costs on certain business mortgage obligations, rent and utilities. The Company and its operating subsidiaries were granted forgiveness of their respective PPP loans by the SBA during fiscal years 2021 and 2022. The Companys last remaining PPP loans and interest were forgiven in December 2021 and corresponding gains in the aggregate amount of $16,773 were recognized during fiscal 2022.\nThe former PPP loans obtained by GEE Group Inc., and its operating subsidiaries together as an affiliated group, exceeded the $2 million audit threshold established by the SBA, and therefore, will be subject to audit by the SBA in the future. If any of the nine forgiven PPP loans are reinstated in whole or in part as the result of a future audit, a charge or charges would be incurred, accordingly, and they would need to be repaid. If the companies are unable to repay the portions of their PPP loans that ultimately may be reinstated from available liquidity or operating cash flow, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt capital to repay the PPP loans.\n10. Shareholders Equity and Share-based Compensation\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn April 27, 2023, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of the Companys currently outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program will continue through December 31, 2023, may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any number of shares of common stock. The share repurchase program is to be conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Subject to applicable rules and regulations, the shares of common stock may be purchased from time to time in the open market transactions and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate, based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements, and other business considerations.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 3,411 shares of its common stock for $1,984, including commissions and fees, at an average price of $0.56 per share excluding these associated costs.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has authorized 20,000 shares of preferred stock of which 1,000 shares have been designated Series A Preferred Stock, and no shares were issued or are outstanding; 5,950 shares have been designated Series B Preferred Stock, of which 5,926 shares were issued and none remain outstanding, and 3,000 shares have been designated Series C Preferred Stock, of which 2,093 shares were issued and none remained outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and 2021. Based on the terms of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, if certain fundamental transactions were to occur, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock would require redemption, which would preclude permanent equity classification on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has a Liquidation Value equal to $1.00 per share and ranks pari passu with the Companys Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and senior to all Junior Securities (including the Companys Common Stock) with respect to any distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nAmended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were vested and unvested shares of restricted stock and stock options outstanding under the Companys Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended (Incentive Stock Plan). During fiscal 2021, the Incentive Stock Plan was amended to increase the total shares available for restricted stock and stock options by 10,000 to a total of 15,000 (7,500 restricted stock shares and 7,500 stock option shares). The Incentive Stock Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to grant either incentive or non-statutory stock options to employees. Vesting periods are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were 7,782 shares available to be granted under the Plan (4,216 shares available for restricted stock grants and 3,566 shares available for non-qualified stock option grants).\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company has granted 742 and 100 shares of restricted stock during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of the restricted shares granted during fiscal 2023, 150 were granted to new members of the Board of Directors upon their election in fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2022, the Company granted 100 shares of restricted stock to a non-executive member of management.\nOn September 27, 2022, the Company adopted a new annual incentive compensation program (AICP) for its executives to be administered under the Companys Incentive Stock Plan, under which the remaining 592 shares granted in fiscal 2023 were awarded. The AICP includes a long-term incentive (LTI) compensation plan in the form of restricted stock awards comprised of two components: one that vests based on future service only, and a second that vests based on future service and performance. Initial awards under both service-only and service plus performance-based components of the AICP LTI plan are determined based on financial performance measures for the immediately preceding fiscal year.\nDuring fiscal 2023, 551 of the 592 restricted shares granted under the AICP were granted based on actual results for fiscal 2022, as measured against corresponding financial targets for that year, and will cliff vest as of December 2, 2025. The remaining 41 of the 592 restricted shares granted under the AICP during fiscal 2023, represent the earned portion of the initial performance-based shares granted based on fiscal 2022 results, as adjusted for the outcome with regard to the financial targets applicable to those shares set by the Companys board of directors for fiscal 2023. The final 41 restricted shares of the initial portion of the fiscal 2022 service plus performance-based restricted shares granted were determined based on the actual financial performance of the Company for fiscal 2023 and will cliff vest on December 2, 2025, the third anniversary from their date of grant.\nUnder the AICP LTI plan, the service plus performance-based grants of 41 restricted shares during fiscal 2023 represent the first tranche of a three-year schedule of awards. The next two tranches of up to 262 shares each (up to an additional 524 restricted shares in total) are scheduled to become effective as the Companys financial plans and targets are set by the board of directors prior to each anniversary date for each of the two subsequent fiscal years, respectively. As the vesting of the two subsequent tranches will be based in part on performance conditions that have not yet been determined, the grant dates and fair values of these scheduled awards will be established in the future. The end of the requisite service periods for the 592 restricted shares granted under the AICP during fiscal 2023, plus the additional 524 restricted shares eligible to be granted in the future, once the performance conditions are determined for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, is December 2, 2025. Therefore, the remaining two tranches of the fiscal 2022 service plus performance-based awards may be expected to have grant dates corresponding with the establishment of the fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 financial performance targets by the Companys board of directors. However, all final shares determined for each of the two subsequent annual tranches also will cliff vest on December 2, 2025.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nShare-based compensation expense attributable to restricted stock was $318 and $293 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The stock options generally vest on annual schedules during periods ranging from two to four years from the date of grant, although some options are fully vested upon grant. Share-based compensation expense attributable to stock options was $546 and $342 in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.

Of the $17.7 million of federal net operating losses, $14.6 million can be carried indefinitely.\nFuture realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company performed an evaluation to determine whether a valuation allowance was needed. The Company considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, which included the results of operations for the current and preceding years. The Company also considered whether there was any currently available information about future years. As of September 30, 2023, in part because in the current year we achieved three years of cumulative pretax income, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes are realizable. It therefore released the valuation allowance accordingly.\nUnder Internal Revenue Code 382, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporations ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a loss corporation as defined in Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change. In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations for both federal taxes and the many states and local tax jurisdictions in which we operate or do business in. ASC 740 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\nWe record tax positions as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgement changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the recognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022 we have not recorded any material uncertain tax positions in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2023, and 2022, no accrued interest or penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations. The Companys tax years are still open under statute from September 30, 2020, to the present. Earlier years may be examined to the extent that the net operating loss carryforwards from those earlier years are used in future periods. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n12. Commitment and Contingencies\nLitigation and Claims\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, on March 23, 2022, the Company settled the Sands Brothers Venture Capital II, LLC lawsuit. Under the terms of the agreement and release, neither the plaintiff nor the Company admitted or conceded to any wrongdoing and the matter was settled in its entirety for a one-time payment to the plaintiff of approximately $1,175, of which the Companys portion was $975, with insurance paying the balance. This payment was due and paid by April 8, 2022, and recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a pre-tax charge in the Companys consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2022.\nIndemnification Agreements \\\nOn April 27, 2023, the Company entered into Indemnification Agreements with certain of its officers and members of the Board to provide for indemnification of each individual in their respective capacities as officers and members of the Board of the Company to the fullest extent permitted under the Companys Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and the Illinois Business Corporation Act. The Company carries directors and officers liability insurance, which is intended to provide protection for potential claims against the Companys directors and officers. Management is not aware of any matters or circumstances under which potential liability arising from these agreements would be material to the consolidated financial statements..\nThere are no other pending significant legal proceedings to which the Company is a party for which management believes the ultimate outcome would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position.\n13. Defined Contribution Plan\nThe Company provides a defined contribution plan (the 401(k) Plan) for the benefit of its eligible core and field personnel, including those assigned to provide staffing services for clients. The 401(k) Plan allows participants to make contributions subject to applicable statutory limitations. The Company matches 10% of each participants contributions on the first 10% of contributions from their wages. The Company match under the 410(k) Plan totaled $94 and $92 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGEE GROUP INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in thousands except per share data, unless otherwise stated)\n14.

Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThe evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting included a review of our objectives and processes, implementation by us and the effect on the information generated for use in this Annual Report. In the course of this evaluation and in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, we sought to identify material weaknesses in our controls, to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, and to confirm that any necessary corrective action, including process improvements, were being undertaken. Our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures is done quarterly and management reports the effectiveness of our controls and procedures in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our internal control over financial reporting is also evaluated on an ongoing basis by our executive management and by other individuals in our organization. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and to make modifications as necessary. We periodically evaluate our processes and procedures and make improvements as required.\nBecause of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management applies its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during fiscal 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Such entities are also required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all such Section 16(a) reports.\nTo our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us regarding the filing of required reports, we believe that all Section 16(a) reports applicable to our directors, executive officers, and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners with respect to fiscal 2023 have been filed.\nBoard of Directors Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board has no policy regarding the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and we currently bestow the roles and responsibilities of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer with Mr. Dewan. The Board believes that Mr. Dewans service as both Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Mr. Dewan possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing the Company and its business and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Boards time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. His combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances the Companys ability to communicate its strategy clearly and consistently to the Companys shareholders, employees, and customers.\nIndependent directors and management have different perspectives and roles in strategy development. The Companys independent directors bring experience, oversight, and expertise from outside the company and industry, while the management brings company-specific experience and expertise. The Board believes that a board of directors combined with independent board members and management is in the best interest of shareholders because it promotes strategy development and execution and facilitates information flow between management and the Board, which are essential to effective governance.\nEffective July 5, 2023, and upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board elected Thomas Vetrano as Lead Independent Director of the Board. The Lead Independent Directors responsibilities include but not limited to, serving as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, calling for meetings of the independent directors, presiding at all meetings of the independent directors and any Board meeting when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors, providing feedback from executive session of the independent directors to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and other senior management, responding directly to shareholder and stakeholder questions, as appropriate, leading the Boards evaluation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and succession planning, and serving a key role in Boards annual self-assessment. The Board believes the appointment of Mr. Vetrano as Lead Independent Director will further enhance its means to accomplish its oversight responsibilities, and also is in keeping with its desire to follow best practices in governance. The Board provides overall risk oversight for the Company as part of its normal, ongoing responsibilities. It receives reports from Mr. Dewan, Mr. Thorpe, and other members of senior management on a periodic basis on areas of risk facing the Company. In addition, committees of the Board oversee specific elements of risk or potential risk.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board has determined, with the assistance of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, that each of its current directors, other than Mr. Dewan, is an independent director under the NYSE American Listed Company Manual. The Board has affirmatively determined that William Isaac, Darla Moore, Jyrl James, Matthew Gormly, Thomas Vetrano, Peter Tanous, J. Randall Waterfield and David Sandberg satisfy the independence standards under the NYSE American Listed Company Manual. Thomas Vetrano serves as the Companys Lead Independent Director.\nThe Board has determined that each current member of the Audit Committee meets the additional independence criteria required for audit committee membership under the listing standards of the NYSE American and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and possesses the experience and expertise required to be considered a financial expert as defined under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition to the independence standards provided in the NYSE American Listed Company Manual, the Board has determined that each director who serves on our Audit Committee satisfies standards established by the SEC providing that, in order to qualify as independent for the purposes of membership on that committee, members of audit committees may not (i) accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company other than their director compensation or (ii) be an affiliated person of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Board has also determined that each member of the Compensation Committee satisfies the NYSE American standards for independence of Compensation Committee members.\nBoard of Directors and Committee Meetings\nThe Board of Directors meets on a regularly scheduled basis to review significant developments affecting the Company and to act on matters requiring Board of Directors approval.

The Board of Directors held twelve (12) meetings and executed seven (7) unanimous consents during fiscal 2023. No director of the Company attended less than 75% of the total meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees on which such Board of Directors members served during this period.\nThe members of the Board of Directors are expected to attend the Companys Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

The Nominating Committee held three (3) meetings and executed one (1) unanimous consent during fiscal 2023.\nIn evaluating candidates to serve on the Companys Board of Directors, consideration is given to the level of experience, financial literacy and business acumen of the candidate. In addition, qualified candidates for director are those who, in the judgment of the Nominating Committee, have significant decision-making responsibility, with business, legal or academic experience. The Nominating Committee will consider recommendations for Board of Directors candidates that are received from various sources, including directors and officers of the Company, other business associates and shareholders, and all candidates will be considered on an equal basis, regardless of source.\nShareholders may contact the Nominating Committee to make such recommendations by writing in care of the Secretary of the Company, at 7751 Belfort Road, Suite 150, Jacksonville, FL 32256.

It may not delegate this authority. It meets as often as necessary to carry out its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee held two (2) meetings and executed two (2) unanimous consents during fiscal 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee meets at least annually to consider the compensation of the Companys executive officers, including the establishment of base salaries and performance targets for the succeeding year, and the consideration of restricted common stock and stock option awards. Management provides the Compensation Committee with such information as may be requested by the chairman or its members, which in the past has included historical compensation information of the executive officers, tally sheets, internal pay equity statistics, and market survey data. Under the guidelines of the NYSE American, the Chief Executive Officer may not be present during the Compensation Committees deliberations regarding his compensation. If requested by the Committee, the Chief Executive Officer may provide recommendations regarding the compensation of the other officers.\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to retain compensation consultants. During fiscal 2022, the Company engaged independent compensation consultants to perform a compensation study and analysis of the annual compensation of its executives. The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of the compensation consultants based on the specific criteria under applicable SEC rules and determined that no conflict of interest is raised by the compensation consultants work for the Compensation Committee. The study included relevant market data, various peer group comparisons, and best practices and comparisons of the amounts and components of the Companys executive pay to its top three executives with those of several comparable companies. Upon completion of its study, the independent consulting firm presented its findings and recommendations to the Company and its Compensation Committee. With the benefit of the findings, recommendations and other inputs provided by the independent consultants, the Company drafted a formal Annual Incentive Compensation Program, which was reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board.\nThe Compensation Committee also has the responsibility to make recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of directors.

Dewan, Stuckey and Thorpe for fiscal 2023 were accrued but unpaid as of September 30, 2023; but were subsequently paid on December 1, 2023 following determination of the final amounts and approval by the Companys Compensation Committee and Board of Directors.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company engaged independent compensation consultants to perform a compensation study and analysis of the annual compensation of its executives. The study included comparisons of the amounts and components of the Companys executive pay to its top three executives with those of several comparable companies. The Company and its Compensation Committee received a report from the independent compensation consultant outlining its findings and recommendations. With the benefit of the independent consultants reported findings and recommendations, the Company drafted a formal Annual Incentive Compensation Program (AICP), which was reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and the Companys board of directors.\nThe AICP includes a performance based short term incentive (STI), and a partially performance based long term incentive (LTI) compensation component. The STI portion is payable in the form of annual cash bonuses and the LTI portion if payable in equity-based compensation in the form of restricted stock. Grants under the LTI component are to be granted under the Companys 2013 Incentive Stock Plan and are further comprised of two components; one that vests based on time passed alone, and a second that vest over time but also based on future performance.\nThe overall structure, design and other key components of the AICP were initially reviewed by the Compensation Committee during several meetings in 2022 and were presented to and approved by the Companys Board of Directors at its annual meeting held on August 26, 2022. Additional details regarding the AICP, including the pro forma results expected for fiscal year 2022, and projected targets for fiscal 2023, were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and the Companys Board of Directors at a special teleconference meeting on September 22, 2022. The approvals were conditioned upon final determination of the Companys results for fiscal 2022, including actual AICP performance measures for fiscal 2022, and the approval of final financial plans for fiscal 2023, including performance targets for the fiscal 2023 AICP.\nOption Awards\nThe option awards column represents the fair value of the stock options as measured on the grant date.\nNo stock options were awarded to the named executive officers during fiscal 2023. If and when stock options are granted, the Companys policy is that option prices must be set that are equal to the market price on the date of grant, that they have vesting dates five years or less after the date of grant, and that they have expiration dates ten years after the date of grant.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table summarizes equity awards granted to named executive officers and directors that were outstanding as of September 30, 2023:\nOption Awards\nStock Awards\nName\nNumber of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options: # Exercisable\nNumber of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options: # Unexercisable\nOption Exercise Price $\nOption Expiration Date\n# of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested #\nMarket Value of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not\nVested $\nDerek Dewan, Chief Executive Officer\n-\n-\n-\n-\n488,353\n288,128\nAlex Stuckey, Chief Operating Officer\n-\n-\n-\n-\n353,585\n208,615\nKim Thorpe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n50,000\n-\n2.21\n06/15/28\n392,206\n231,402\nRetirement Benefits\nThe Company does not maintain a tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan for any of its executive officers or employees. The Company has a 401(k)-retirement plan in which all full-time employees may participate after one year of service.\nPay Versus Performance\nThe following pay versus performance disclosure is new this year, as required by rules recently adopted by the SEC in the fall of 2022. The disclosure required for smaller reporting companies consists of a Pay Versus Performance table and reconciliation of the information reported in the table. The SEC believes this disclosure will help shareholders better evaluate the link between executive pay and performance, both for the Company on a stand-alone basis and as compared to other publicly traded companies.\nThe Pay Versus Performance table is highly regulated and requires pay disclosure that is significantly different than what we have customarily provided in the Summary Compensation Table and the other executive compensation tables in prior years. The table currently provides SEC mandated compensation data for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 for our Named Executive Officers (NEOs), including our principal Executive Officer (PEO), along with certain financial performance measures. In reviewing the table, our shareholders should note the following:\no\nThe amounts in columns (b) and (d) of the table are taken from or derived directly from the total compensation paid to the relevant NEOs as reported in this years or prior years Summary Compensation Tables\u037e\no\nThe compensation actually paid in columns (c) and (e) represents a new type of compensation disclosure mandated by the SEC, the intent of which is to try and isolate the amount of compensation earned by the relevant NEO(s) in each year. To calculate compensation actually paid, we are required to start with the totals for that year as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, deduct the Summary Compensation Table values for stock and option awards, and then add back amounts for new and previously outstanding stock and option awards in a manner mandated by the SEC. The disclosure and calculations are complex and can be confusing, and the amounts determined in accordance with the rules often bear no relation to the money or the economic value received or monetized by a particular NEO in the given year. We therefore caution that the term compensation actually paid should not be read literally and does not actually reflect the take home amounts received by our NEOs in a given year\u037e and\no\nThe SEC rules require that we include in the Pay Versus Performance table information regarding our U.S. GAAP net income results. U.S. GAAP net income was not a performance metric in any of our compensation programs and did not affect the compensation awarded to our NEOs for the years covered by the Pay Versus Performance Table. We are nonetheless required to include such information in the table and we urge our investors to keep in mind that U.S. GAAP net income did not drive the amount of pay awarded to or realized by our NEOs.\nPay Versus Performance Table\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\nName\nFiscal Year\nSummary Compensation Table Total for PEO\nCompensation Actually Paid to PEO (1)\nAverage Summary Compensation Table Total for Non -PEO NEOs\nAverage Compensation Actually paid to Non-PEO NEOs (1)\nValue of Initial Fixed $100 Investment Based on Total Shareholder Return (2)\nNet Income available to Maiden Common Shareholder (in thousands)\nDerek Dewan\n$\n802,153\n$\n687,277\n-\n-\n$\n$\n9,418\nChief Executive Officer\n$\n851,550\n$\n894,050\n-\n-\n$\n$\n19,599\nAlex Stuckey\n-\n-\n$\n530,777\n$\n448,534\n$\n$\n9,418\nChief Operating Officer\n-\n-\n$\n519,988\n$\n571,155\n$\n$\n19,599\nKim Thorpe\n-\n-\n$\n539,514\n$\n390,276\n$\n$\n9,418\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n-\n-\n$\n561,363\n$\n667,780\n$\n$\n19,599\n(1)\nTo calculate compensation actually paid, adjustments were made to the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable year.

The Board has affirmatively determined that William Isaac, Darla Moore, Jyrl James, Matthew Gormly, Thomas Vetrano, Peter Tanous, J. Randall Waterfield and David Sandberg satisfy the independence standards under the NYSE American Listed Company Manual. Thomas Vetrano serves as the Companys Lead Independent Director.\nThe Board has determined that each current member of the Audit Committee meets the additional independence criteria required for audit committee membership under the listing standards of the NYSE American and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and possesses the experience and expertise required to be considered a financial expert as defined under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition to the independence standards provided in the NYSE American Listed Company Manual, the Board has determined that each director who serves on our Audit Committee satisfies standards established by the SEC providing that, in order to qualify as independent for the purposes of membership on that committee, members of audit committees may not (i) accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company other than their director compensation or (ii) be an affiliated person of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Board has also determined that each member of the Compensation Committee satisfies the NYSE American standards for independence of Compensation Committee members.\nRelated Party Transactions\nOther than as disclosed below, and except for the New Dewan, Stuckey and Thorpe Employment Agreements, each as defined and described in \"Executive Compensation\", the Cooperation Agreement with Red Oak and the Waterfield Agreement, each as defined and described in Agreements with Respect to Director Nominations, there have been no transactions since October 1, 2021 or any currently proposed transaction or series of similar transactions to which the Company was or is to be a party, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any current or former director or officer of the Company, any 5% or greater stockholder of the Company or any member of the immediate family of any such persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.\nThe Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is FORVIS, LLP (FORVIS) (PCAOB Firm ID No. 686) located in Tampa, Florida. As previously disclosed in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 15, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors dismissed Friedman, LLP (Friedman) on April 12, 2022 and engaged FORVIS (formerly known as Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP) to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and to audit the Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Friedman was the predecessor to FORVIS, having served as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm since November 29, 2012 through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and first fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe following table presents fees billed by FORVIS for the following professional services rendered for the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\nFiscal\nFiscal\n2022 (1)\nAudit fees\n$ 245,000\n$ 192,000\nAudit-related fees\n34,000\n32,000\n(1)\nValues presented for fiscal 2022 include only fees billed by FORVIS. Friedman performed services for the company during the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, re-issued their opinion on the fiscal 2021 consolidated financials, and provided their consent on this fiscal 2022 annual filing. Fees incurred in relation to those services totaled $52,000 in fiscal 2022.\nAudit fees relate to services for the audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year and for reviews of the interim consolidated financial statements as well as providing consents for the inclusion of FORVIS reports in SEC registration statements and filings.\nAudit-related fees relate to services that are reasonably related to the audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements and are not included in audit fees. These services include audits of the Companys 401(k) retirement plan and a special audit of revenue pertaining to one of the Companys client engagements which include FORVIS reports.\nThe Audit Committees policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, and to not engage them to perform the specific non-audit services proscribed by law or regulation for independence reasons. At or just prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm and approves the fees and services to be performed for the ensuing year. On at least an annual basis, the Audit Committee reviews fees billed for all services provided for the year to date, and it pre-approves additional services if necessary. The Audit Committees pre-approval policies allow management to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for consultations on tax or accounting matters up to an aggregate of $10,000 annually. All fees listed in the table above were approved in accordance with the Audit Committees policies.\nPART IV Item 15.
