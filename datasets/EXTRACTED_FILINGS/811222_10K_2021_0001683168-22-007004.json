    "content": "ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.\nHistory and Operation of the Business\nLegacy Card Company, LLC (Legacy) was formed as a California limited liability company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted to a Nevada corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff Lexington Corp (formerly Cardiff International, Inc.) (Cardiff Lexington, the Company), a publicly traded Colorado corporation. On August 27, 2014, Cardiff Lexington redomiciled to Florida. On April 13, 2021, Cardiff Lexington Corporation converted from a Florida Corporation to a Nevada Corporation.\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Cardiff Lexington was restructured into a holding company that began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, or high return investments, with the goal of generating the net income required to support a consistent dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, and provide financing and management support to enhance their ability to provide acceptable returns to investors. New classes of preferred stock have been and may continue to be created to streamline voting rights, avoid debt, and acquire new businesses. By December 31, 2021, we had acquired ten businesses. Four of the acquired businesses were merged into two, one was discontinued, and two were sold during 2021. Accordingly, we currently operate the following four businesses, each as a separate subsidiary:\n\u00b7 We Three, LLC, which operates under the name Affordable Housing Initiative or AHI, was acquired in April 2014. AHI is located in Maryville, Tennessee. AHI acquires both mobile homes and mobile home parks offering an alternative to traditional housing. Their mobile home business is a popular option for a homeowner wishing to avoid large down payments, expensive maintenance costs, monthly mortgage payments and high property taxes. If bad credit is an issue preventing people from purchasing a traditional house, AHI will provide a financial leasing option with O interest on the lease providing a lease to own option for their family home. Most homes are 3 bedroom/2bath homes making the dream of owning a home possible.\n\u00b7 Edge View Properties, Inc., was acquired in July 2014 (Edge View). Edge View consists of 30 prime acres of land; 23.5 acres zoned MDR (Medium Density Residential) with 12 lots already platted and 48 lots zoned HDR (High Density Residential), 4 acres of dedicated river front property zoned for recreation on the Salmon River, Idahos premier whitewater river and 2.5 acres zoned for commercial use. Three lots were sold during 2021 for a total price of $152,000. All land is in the city limits of Salmon and adjacent to the Frank church Wilderness Park (the largest wilderness park in the lower 48 states).\n\u00b7 Platinum Tax Defenders, LLC, which we acquired on July 31, 2018, is a full-service tax resolution firm located in Los Angeles, CA. Since 2011, Platinum Tax has been assisting all types of taxpayers resolve any and all issues with IRS and applicable state tax agencies. Platinum Tax provides fee-based tax resolution services to individuals and companies that have federal and state tax liabilities by assisting its clients to settle outstanding tax debts. Specifically, the Platinum Tax teams tax relief services include but are not limited to, back taxes, offer in compromise, audit representation, amending tax returns, tax preparation, tax resolution, wage garnishment relief, removal of bank levies and liens, bookkeeping, and other financial challenges.\n\u00b7 Nova Ortho and Spine, PLL, was acquired May 31, 2021 and provides a full range of diagnostic and surgical services for injuries and disorders of the skeletal system and associated bones, joints, tendons, muscles, ligaments, and nerves. From sports injuries, to sprains, strains, and fractures, our doctors are dedicated to helping you return to your active lifestyle. Orthopedic and pain procedure services include hip and knee replacement, shoulder reconstruction, fracture care and hand surgery, as well as spinal surgery in the State of Florida.\nCardiff Lexington divested its holdings in the food services sector: Repicci's Italian Ice and Gelato and Romeo's New York Style Pizza. And divested in one of its tax resolution companies. The companies restaurant franchise operations have been hard hit by the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to this crisis taken by the federal, state, and local government. In light of current circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, management is continuing to evaluate alternatives to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on the Company and its shareholders. Cardiff Lexington Board of Directors has narrowed its forward focus to acquisitions in the financial services, healthcare and real estate sectors.\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2020 has caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (COVID-19 Pandemic). Due to the IRS prolonging individual tax filings, this affected our tax resolution businesses in 2021 and management decided to divest JM Enterprise 1, Inc. (Key Tax Group). The Companys tax resolution business operations have been hard hit by the economic pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent directives and responses to this crisis taken by the IRS, federal, state, and local governments. Considering these circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company, as a public reporting company, must evaluate what the Company should and are obligated to do in order to protect shareholders.\nCardiff Lexington is a diversified holding company that operates much like a cooperative, leveraging proven management in private companies that become subsidiaries under our umbrella. Our current emphasis is on the financial services, healthcare, and real estate sectors. Our platform provides an Equity Exit or Equity Capitalization strategy for acquisitions as well as a diversified investment platform for investors that is intended to mitigate risk. Our Buy and Build strategy seeks niche companies which complement existing subsidiaries. Our acquisition strategy is driven by structure, transaction value, alignment, resources and return on investment. Our acquisition strategy is not limited by geographic location, and is focused on proven management teams, attractive markets, and historical operating margins. We target acquisitions of mature, high growth, niche companies. Cardiff Lexingtons strategy identifies and empowers select, income-producing, middle market private businesses and commercial real estate properties.\nThe target companys management team typically maintains control of the day-to-day operations. Acquisitions become standalone autonomous subsidiaries that gain the advantages of a publicly traded company without losing their independent management control. Management enjoys the advantage of improved valuation, liquidity, synergies, and support, along with diversification and asset appreciation through collective subsidiary performance. Diversification and pooled resources leverage value and mitigate risk.\nCardiff Lexington provides these companies both the enhanced ability to raise money for operations or expansion, and an equity exit and liquidity strategy for the owner, heirs, and/or Investors.\nFor investors, Cardiff Lexington provides a diversified lower risk to protect and safely enhance their investment by continually adding assets and holdings.\nCardiff Lexington employs a merge, acquire, and hold strategy to maximize value and potential of private, often family run, enterprises while providing diversification and risk mitigation for all shareholders.\nCardiff Lexington is led by strong and talented roster of executives and advisors providing expert acquisition, market guidance and added value for subsidiaries and investors.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, since early calendar year 2020 through current, has caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (COVID-19 Pandemic). We are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the Company operates. It is expected that the Company's customers and suppliers may well continue to be impacted which could materially and adversely affect the Company. Our ability to obtain or deliver inventory or services, and our ability to collect accounts receivables as customers may be affected\nThe financial services segments of the economy was adversely affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Management will continue to monitor its businesses and focus our growth primarily in the health industry.\nHuman Capital\nCollectively, Cardiff Lexington and its subsidiaries employ approximately 19 employees and anticipates hiring additional personnel with new acquisitions. We believe that we have good relations with our employees and our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group or agreement. We believe our ability to attract and retain employees is a key to a successful acquisition strategy.\nCompetition\nWe are a small capitalization holding company that seeks to enable businesses to take advantage of the potential access to capital markets provided by affiliation with a publicly traded company. Cardiff Lexington began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to generate sufficient earnings to pay a consistent dividend to our shareholders. The strategy is intended to mitigate risk to shareholders by building a diversified portfolio of profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. We will continue to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses in the financial services and healthcare, and real estate sectors.\nWe face significant competition in the markets in which our subsidiaries operate. Platinum Tax has significant competition in most of the markets in which they operate from other local tax resolution entities and from larger national companies. AHI has significant competition from other private companies in the area and a few real estate investment trusts, which compete in the manufactured housing communities Edge View competes in the highly competitive housing industry. Some of our subsidiaries competitors may have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, management or other resources in particular markets or in general. Our market position depends on our financing, development and operation capabilities, reputation, experience and track record. There can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not offer products or services comparable or superior to those that our subsidiaries offer. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share.\nProprietary Information\nWe own the following trademarks: Cardiff USA; Mission Tuition, Legacy Card Company and Small Cap Rescue.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe do not expect to be subject to material governmental regulation. However, it is our policy to fully comply with all governmental regulation and regulatory authorities.\nResearch and Development\nWe are investing in the development of a new website that will effectively present the Companys acquisition strategy and its benefits to prospective acquisition targets and the communities we serve, as well as keep investors informed of our progress in executing our strategy.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nWe believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.\nHow to Obtain our SEC Filings\nWe file annual, quarterly, and special reports, information statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Reports, information statements and other information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Such material may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nOur investor relations department can be contacted at our principal executive office located at, 401 East Las Olas Blvd. Unit 1400, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301. Our telephone number is (844-628-2100). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this document before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock.\nThe occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating result. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Strategy and Industry\nWe are a holding company and rely on distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and derive all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for payments or distributions to meet our obligations. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay us.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to substantial risk.\nOur acquisition of companies is subject to substantial risk, including but not limited to the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which we may not be indemnified post-closing), the risk of over-paying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis), the ability to obtain or retain customers and the risks of entering markets where we have limited experience. While we perform due diligence on prospective acquisitions, we may not be able to discover all potential operational deficiencies in such entities.\nOur prior and future acquisitions may not perform as expected or the returns from such acquisitions may not support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. Furthermore, integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and may divert management's attention from our existing business concerns, disrupt our ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. Even if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to such cash per unit, those acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in such cash per unit as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Furthermore, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and stockholders will generally not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to manage our growing and changing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we grow, we expect to encounter additional challenges to our internal processes, capital commitment process, and acquisition funding and financing capabilities. Our existing operations, personnel, systems and internal control may not be adequate to support our growth and expansion and may require us to make additional unanticipated investments in our infrastructure. To manage the future growth of our operations, we will be required to improve our administrative, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and maintain, expand, train and manage our growing employee base. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies successfully or respond to competitive pressures. As a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDuring our startup phase we were not profitable and generated minimal revenue and no profit.\nSince the launch of its acquisition strategy in 2013, the Company has not been profitable. Although management is pleased with the execution of the Companys acquisition strategy and the revenues it has generated to date, the Company may never become profitable, and could go out of business.\nDespite having sustained net losses from our inception, we still consider ourselves a going concern.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an emphasis of matter paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern, due to our continued losses and deficiencies in working capital. We believe our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:\n\u00b7 our ability to acquire profitable businesses;\n\u00b7 our ability to generate substantial revenues; and\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain additional financing\nBased upon current plans, we may incur operating losses in future periods. Also, we expect to incur approximately $6,400,000 in operating costs to be incurred over the next twelve months. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or obtaining other financing in the future to cover these operating costs. Additionally, financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company. Failure to generate sufficient revenues may cause us to go out of business.\nSince we are an early-stage company that has generated minimal revenue, an investment in our shares is highly risky and could result in a complete loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plans.\nWe were incorporated in August 2001 and, since 2013, have focused all our efforts on the acquisition and development of our portfolio of companies which have quadrupled our revenue since 2015. However, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in realizing revenues or in achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the future. Any such failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans or additional sales of our equity securities to continue business operations, which would dilute the value of any shares you hold and could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nFuture acquisitions are important to our success. We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our operations.\nThe acquisition of new companies is central to our business model and critically important to our success. Although we generally seek companies that have positive cash flows, we cannot be certain that the acquired companies will remain cash flow positive and could possibly lose revenues. In addition, there are no assurances that the companies acquired will continue as profitable businesses and could adversely affect our business and any possible revenues.\nSuccessful implementation of our business strategy depends on factors specific to acquiring successful businesses. Adverse changes in our acquisition process could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flow:\n\u00b7 The competitive environment in the specific field of business acquired;\n\u00b7 Our ability to acquire the right businesses that meet customers needs; and\n\u00b7 Our ability to establish, maintain and eventually grow market share in a competitive environment.\nThere are no substantial barriers to acquire established businesses and there is no guarantee the Company will successfully acquire additional businesses, which could severely limit our anticipated revenues. If we cannot acquire established businesses, it could result in the loss of your investment.\nSince we have no copyright protection, unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of our business model, including our governance design or functionality, services, or marketing materials. Any encroachment upon our corporate information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another company's proprietary information or improper use of their copyright, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause confusion among prospective portfolio companies and their customers, and/or have a detrimental effect on our business. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement, litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations. As a result, an investor could lose his or her entire investment.\nRisks Associated with our Common Stock\nOur stock has limited liquidity.\nOur common stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, which is operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (OTC Pink Market). Trading volume in our shares may be sporadic and the price could experience volatility. If adverse market conditions exist, you may have difficulty selling your shares.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for our products; and\n\u00b7 departure of key personnel.\nOur shares are defined as a penny stock under the Exchange Act and rules of the SEC. In general, buying low-priced penny stocks is very risky and speculative. You may not be able to sell your shares when you want to do so, if at all.\nOur shares are defined as a penny stock under the Exchange Act and rules of the SEC. The Exchange Act and SEC rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to such sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock for the year. Earnings, if any, that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion.\nOther General Risks\nThe loss of the services of the current officers and directors could severely impact our business operations and future development, which could result in a loss of revenues and ones ability to ever sell any shares.\nOur performance is substantially dependent upon the professional expertise of the current officers and board of directors. Each has extensive expertise in business development and acquisitions, and we are dependent on their abilities. If they are unable to perform their duties, this could have an adverse effect on business operations, financial condition, and operating results if we are unable to replace them with other individuals qualified to develop and market our business. The loss of their services could result in a loss of revenues, which could result in a reduction of the value of any shares you hold as well as the complete loss of your investment.\nBecause of our size and limited resources, we may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls, which we are required to do in order to comply with U.S. GAAP and securities laws, and which could cause a materially adverse impact on our financial statements, the trading of our common stock and our business.\nWe are a small holding company that lacks the financial resources and qualified personnel to implement and sustain adequate internal controls. As a result, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet proper internal control standards. Therefore, we may, in turn, experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any such deficiencies, material weaknesses or lack of compliance could result in restatements of our historical financial information, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock, adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and our ability to recruit personnel, lead to the delisting of our securities from the electronic platform on which they are traded, lead to litigation claims, thereby diverting managements attention and resources, and which may lead to the payment of damages to the extent such claims are not resolved in our favor, lead to regulatory proceedings, which may result in sanctions, monetary or otherwise, and have a materially adverse effect on our reputation and business.  ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.\nThe Company had operating lease expense of $185,831 and $87,649 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, consisting of the followings.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nLot $ 0 $ 408\nOffice 185,831 87,169\nTotal $ 185,831 $ 87,649 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nCardiff filed a lawsuit on October 4, 2020 in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida seeking to nullify agreements with six individuals. In violation of the management agreement entered into by the Company and Ihsane (Jay) Jahid in connection with the Companys acquisition of Red Rock Travel Group, LLC, the Company alleges that Mr. Jahid engaged in self-interested, self-serving conduct utilizing the Companys goodwill to enter into certain Convertible Note agreements with Matt Kanuck, Rita Home & Investment, LLC, Taoufik Litefti, Khalid Ahroum, and Iham Taharraoui without the legal authority to bind the Company. The Company alleges that it did not authorize Mr. Jahid to enter into the subject agreements with the five other defendants, was not aware that Mr. Jahid had done so, Mr. Jahid was acting outside of the scope of his authority when he caused the Company to enter into the agreements, the five other defendants knew or should have known that Mr. Jahid did not have the authority to bind the Company to the obligations contemplated by the subject agreements, and any rights that the five other defendants claim under the agreements with Mr. Jahid are controverted by the management agreement that was in place between the Company and Mr. Jahid and therefore cannot form the basis for any breach of contract claims against the Company. The parties are currently engaged in settlement negotiations.\nOn August 31, 2021, without knowledge or consent of Cardiff Lexington or Edge View Properties and in a manner to conceal his unlawful actions, a property manager used a new company check from Summit National Bank to withdraw $50,000 from the Company Account. The Defendant is being charged with intentional, oppressive, fraudulent, malicious and outrageous damages. We received the Courts decision on our Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. In the decision, the Judge denied our Motion for Partial Summary Judgment due to several disputed facts and unanswered questions. Case is pending. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot Applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nHolders\nAs of August 15, 2022, there were 853 record holders of our common stock, and there were 166,130,069 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nPublic Market for Common Stock\nOur common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), is currently quoted on the OTC Pink Market, which is operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol CDIX. The OTC Pink Market is a quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over the counter, or OTC, equity securities. An OTC equity security generally is any equity that is not listed or traded on a national securities exchange. The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the high and low bid prices per share of our common stock as reported by the OTC Pink Market quotation service. These bid prices represent prices quoted by broker-dealers on the OTC Pink quotation service. The quotations reflect inter- dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark- down or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions. The prices presented have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of a one for ten thousand (1:10,000) reverse stock split of the Companys common stock effected on April 4, 2020.\nHigh Low\nDecember 31, 2021\n1st Quarter $ .0660 $ .0102\n2nd Quarter $ .0240 $ .0104\n3rd Quarter $ .0165 $ .0045\n4th Quarter $ .0071 $ .0001\nDecember 31, 2020\n1st Quarter $ 40.00 $ .0001\n2nd Quarter $ .5100 $ .0001\n3rd Quarter $ .4200 $ .0400\n4th Quarter $ .0810 $ .0180\nThe market price of our common stock will be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results, general trends in the market, and other factors, over many of which we have little or no control. In addition, broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, business, and political conditions, may adversely affect the market for our common stock, regardless of our actual or projected performance.\nThe Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).\nA purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. The Companys common stock constitute penny stock under the Exchange Act and SEC regulations. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker- dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock.\nThe penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which:\n\u00b7 contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;\n\u00b7 contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act;\n\u00b7 contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;\n\u00b7 contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;\n\u00b7 defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and\n\u00b7 contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size, and format) as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation;\nThe broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer:\n\u00b7 the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;\n\u00b7 the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;\n\u00b7 the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and\n\u00b7 monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.\nIn addition, the SECs penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker- dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, shareholders may have difficulty selling their securities.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not previously declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our operations and the expansion of our business.

We had revenues in the amount of 10,008,860 and $3,453,058 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $6,555,802 or 189.9%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of Nova Ortho which generated revenue of $5,413,890 for the seven months ending December 31, 2021, (ii) the sale of three parcels of land by Edge View for $152,000 and (iii) higher sales in the financial services sector for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, offset by a decrease in housing rentals.\nCost of Goods Sold. We had costs of sales in the amount of $3,848,406 and $1,668,146 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $2,180,260 or 130.7%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of Nova Ortho which incurred cost of sales of $1,685,625 for the seven months ending December 31, 2021, (ii) the sale of three parcels of land by Edge View which incurred cost of sales of $79,481 and (iii) higher cost of sales for the financial services sector for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, offset by a decrease in housing rentals.\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses consist of acquisition costs, depreciation expense, and general and administrative expenses. We had operating expenses of $4,534,352 and $3,589,063 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $945,289 or 26.3%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to: (i) the acquisition of Nova Ortho which incurred operating expenses of $395,088 for the seven months ending December 31, 2021, and (ii) higher operating expenses for the financial services sector for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.\nAmortization of debt discounts. We had amortization of debt discount of $1,051,264 and $1,192,044 for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of $140,780 or 11.8%. Amortization of debt discount is related to our convertible debt.\nInterest Expense and finance charge. During the years end December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest expense and finance charge was $2,982,844 and $332,704, respectively, an increase of $2,650,140 or 796.5%. The increase is due primarily to finance charges of $2,633,634 for the seven months ended December 31, 2021 for Nova Ortho factoring certain accounts receivables.\nNet Loss. As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $409,707 for the year ending December 31, 2021, compared to a net loss for the year ending December 31, 2020 of $2,836,893.\nOur activities have a focus on growing revenue and cash flow. We plan to continue this strategy into 2022.\nTo try to operate at a break-even level based upon our current level of proposed business activity, we believe that we must generate approximately $9,000,000 in revenue per year. Each dollar of revenue is not directly tied to increasing costs. We believe that we can become profitable without incurring additional costs under our current operating cost structure. However, if our forecasts are inaccurate, we will need to raise additional funds. If we need additional capital, our directors have informally agreed to borrow such funds as may be necessary for the next 12 months for working capital purposes, although they have no obligation to do so.\nOn the other hand, if we decide that we cannot operate at a profit in our current configuration, we may choose to scale back our operations to operate at break-even with a smaller level of business activity, while adjusting our overhead to meet the revenue from current operations. In such event, we will probably continue to not be profitable. In addition, we expect that we will need to raise additional funds if we decide to pursue more rapid expansion, the development of new or enhanced services or products, appropriate responses to competitive pressures, or the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies, or if we must respond to unanticipated events that require us to make additional investments. We cannot assure that additional financing will be available when needed on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues. We expect approximately $6,400,000 in operating costs over the next twelve months. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $595,987 and a working capital deficit of $2,502,813. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $279,311 and a working capital deficit of $13,107,015.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $844,826 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a $903,416 decrease from the prior year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement in cash used in operating activities is primarily due to a $903,416 reduction in loss from operating income.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2,323,642 for the year ended December 31, 2021, used for the acquisition of the new business, compared with cash provided by investing activities of $0 for the year ended the December 31, 2020.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities was $3,676,648 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $1,150,423 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is due primarily issuance of preferred stock for the acquisition of Nova Ortho.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital from debt or equity transactions or from operations in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to us. Should we be unable to raise sufficient funds, we may be required to curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products. In addition, increases in expenses or delays in product development may adversely impact our cash position and may require cost reductions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future.\nIn order to continue our operations, development of our products, and implementation of our business plan, we need additional financing. We are currently attempting to obtain additional working capital in a term loan transaction.\nDuring 2020 and 2021 both the Platinum Tax Subsidiary and the Key Tax Subsidiary (sold at December 31, 2021) secured PPP Funding to sustain their respective payrolls.\nThe Companys current funding is now concentrated with 3 primary lenders and the Company is currently in discussions with each to convert those outstanding notes to equity to include lockup and leakout agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements with any party.\nPlan of Operation\nAt Cardiff Lexington, we acquire or merge with middle market companies in the financial services and healthcare sectors by providing them the ability to have an infusion of equity into their business or providing them the ability to exit out of their company. Our focus is not industry or geographic-specific, but rather proven management, market, and margin - we are opportunity oriented.\nWe target acquisitions of mature, high growth, niche companies. Our target companies' proven management maintains full operational control, meaning our acquisitions become standalone autonomous subsidiaries that gain the advantages of a public company without losing their operational independence. For investors, our goal is to provide a diversified lower risk platform to protect and safely enhance their investment by continually adding assets and holdings. By employing a merge or acquire and hold strategy, we expect to maximize the value and potential of private, often family run, enterprises while providing diversification and risk mitigation for all shareholders. Our portfolio is comprised of mature, high growth and niche companies with great management, in an identifiable market, which they have penetrated through a significant advantage, and have acceptable margins.\nCurrent Business Operations\nCardiff Lexington Corp (formerly Cardiff International, Inc.) is currently structured as a company with holdings of various companies.\nThe following milestones are estimates only. The working capital requirements and the projected milestones are approximations only and subject to adjustment based on sales, costs and needs.\nCARDIFF LEXINGTON CORP (FORMERLY CARDIFF INTERNATIONAL, INC.) is a publicly-traded holding company utilizing a form of collaborative governance. Cardiff Lexington targets acquisitions of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing businesses, including commercial real estate properties all of which offer high returns for our investors. Our goal is to provide a form of governance enabling businesses to take advantage of the potential access to capital markets of a publicly-traded company without losing management control. Cardiff Lexington seeks to provide companies the ability to raise money and investors a low-risk environment that protects their investment.\nWE THREE, LLC (D/B/A AFFORDABLE HOUSING INITIATIVE) (AHI): AHI was acquired on May 15, 2014 is located in Maryville, Tennessee.

Orthopedic and pain procedure services include hip and knee replacement, shoulder reconstruction, fracture care and hand surgery, as well as spinal surgery in the State of Florida.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our estimates and we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that (1) involve significant judgments and uncertainties, (2) require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine, and (3) may produce materially different results when using different assumptions. We have discussed these critical accounting estimates, the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our accounting policies specific to share-based compensation expense and estimation of the fair value of derivative liability involve our most significant judgments and estimates that are material to our consolidated financial statements. They are discussed further below.\nShare-based compensation expense\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under the recognition and measurement principles of the fair value recognition provisions of section 718-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-30-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nThe measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.\nIf the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the Company are thinly traded, the use of share prices established in the Companys most recent private sales to third parties, or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.\nThe fair value of share options and similar instruments is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-binomial option pricing valuation model. The ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows:\n\u00b7 Expected term of share options and similar instruments: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding. Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and employees expected exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1, it may be appropriate to use the simplified method, i.e., expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2), if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded\u037e (ii) A company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term\u037e or (iii) A company has or expects to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.\n\u00b7 Expected volatility of the entitys shares and the method used to estimate it. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f) (2)(ii) a thinly traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index. The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility. If shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market\n\u00b7 Risk-free rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.\nGenerally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, based on estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nThe expense resulting from share-based payments is recorded in general and administrative expense in the statements of operations.\nStock Based Compensation - Nonemployees\nEquity Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services\nThe Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of Subtopic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Subtopic 505-50).\nPursuant to ASC Section 505-50-30, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur. If the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the Company are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Companys most recent private placement memorandum, or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.\nThe fair value of share options and similar instruments is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. The ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows:\n\u00b7 Expected term of share options and similar instruments: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and holders expected exercise behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments. The Company uses historical data to estimate holders expected exercise behavior. If the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the Company are thinly traded the contractual term of the share options and similar instruments is used as the expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.\n\u00b7 Expected volatility of the entitys shares and the method used to estimate it. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f) (2)(ii) a thinly traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index. The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility. If shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.\n\u00b7 Expected annual rate of quarterly dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted average expected dividends. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.\n\u00b7 Risk-free rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.\nPursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-257, if fully vested, no forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments), then, because of the elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments, a measurement date has been reached. A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases, when the agreement is entered into), whether the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset.\nPursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-30-S99-1, if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested, forfeitable equity instruments, those equity instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is, the instruments are not considered issued until they vest). Consequently, there would be no recognition at the measurement date and no entry should be recorded.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived brands are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans. The Company believes such assumptions are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment. The Company based this decision on impairment testing of the underlying assets, expected cash flows, decreased asset value and other factors.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation will negatively impact our business plans.\nSeasonality\nWe do not expect our revenues to be impacted by seasonal demands for our services. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nSee next page. Remainder of this page intentionally left blank.\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (Restated)\nConsolidated Statements of Operations (Restated)\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity (Restated)\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Restated)\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Cardiff Lexington Corp. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Cardiff of Lexington Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statement of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt Regarding the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has sustained net losses and has accumulated and working capital deficits, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Goodwill\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $7.9 million of goodwill. As discussed in Note 1 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In accordance with the FASB revised guidance on Testing of Goodwill for Impairment, a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely- than- not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill.\nAuditing the Companys goodwill impairment analyses was complex and highly judgmental due to the nature of qualitive assessment and, where necessary, the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as future operating results, cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be materially affected by future market or economic conditions.\nHow we addressed the matter:\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys goodwill impairment evaluation process, including controls over managements review of the significant assumptions described above.\nOur audit procedures to test the Companys goodwill impairment analyses included evaluating the reasonableness of managements qualitative assessments and in certain instances the estimated fair value of the Companys reporting units. In evaluating estimated fair value of reporting units we, among others, evaluated managements significant assumptions described above and used within the fair value method, and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We engaged our valuation specialists to assist in assessing fair valuation methodologies utilized in the Companys goodwill impairment analyses. We compared certain significant assumptions to existing market information and, where relevant, to the plans of the Company, including managements expectations with regard to the Companys business model, customer base, product mix and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements projected cash flows, where applicable, and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the discount rates, which included comparison of the selected discount rates to the Companys weighted average cost of capital and the risk associated with projected cash flows. Finally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n/s/ Grassi & Co., CPAs, P.C.\nJericho, New York\nOctober 21, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Cardiff Lexington Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardiff Lexington Corporation (the Company) at December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, deficiency in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nEmphasis of Matter\nAs discussed in Note 2, the accompanying 2020 consolidated financial statements for the have been restated.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has sustained net losses and has accumulated and working capital deficits, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIntangible Assets Impairment Assessments\nAs described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has goodwill of $3.5 million at December 31, 2020. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value to determine if the asset is impaired. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. The estimates that management used in calculating the net present values depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the management service activities with regard to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; long-term professional service forecasts; actions of competitors (competing services), future tax and discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the intangible assets impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the net present value of the intangible assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the net present value techniques; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate. Evaluating managements assumptions related to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the intangible assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/ Daszkal Bolton LLP\nDaszkal Bolton LLP\nMarch 31, 2021, except for Note 2 as to which the date is February 8, 2022\nFort Lauderdale, Florida\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018 through 2021.\nCARDIFF LEXINGTON CORP.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Nature of Operations\nLegacy Card Company, LLC (Legacy) was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff Lexington Corporation (Cardiff Lexington, the Company), a publicly held corporation. On April 13, 2021, Cardiff Lexington Corporation converted from a Florida Corporation to a Nevada Corporation.\nIn the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to restructure Cardiff Lexington into a holding company that adopted a new business model known as \"Collaborative Governance,\" a form of governance enabling businesses to take advantage of the potential access to capital markets provided by affiliation with a publicly-traded company. Cardiff Lexington began targeting the acquisition of niche companies with high growth potential. The reason for this strategy was to protect the Companys shareholders by acquiring businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors.\nDescription of Business\nCardiff Lexington consists of the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nWe Three, LLC dba Affordable Housing Initiative (AHI), acquired May 15, 2014\nRomeos Alpharetta, LLC dba Romeos NY Pizza (Romeos Pizza), acquired September 30, 2014; Sold July 1, 2020.\nEdge View Properties, Inc., (Edge View) acquired July 16, 2014\nRepiccis Franchise Group, LLC (Repiccis Group), acquired August 10, 2016; Sold June 1, 2020.\nPlatinum Tax Defenders, LLC (Platinum Tax), acquired July 31, 2018\nJM Enterprises 1, Inc. dba Key Tax Group (Key Tax), acquired May 8, 2019; Sold December 31, 2021\nRed Rock Travel Group, LLC (Red Rock), acquired July 31, 2018, discontinued May 31, 2019\nNova Ortho and Spine, PLLC (Nova), acquired May 31, 2021\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cardiff, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: AHI, Edge View, Platinum Tax, Nova Ortho and Spine and subsidiaries shown as discontinued operations includes Red Rock, Romeos, Repiccis and Key Tax. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications would have no material effect on the reported consolidated financial results. Subsidiaries discontinued are shown as discontinued operations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Management uses its historical records and knowledge of its business in making estimates. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nChange in Capital Structure\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Company announced a reverse split of several of its Preferred Stock Classes effective December 31, 2020.\nIn May 2020, the Company affected a 10,000:1 reverse split of Common Stock effective March 31, 2020.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, the Company completed a change in domicile from a Florida corporation to a Nevada Corporation.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of a novel coronavirus throughout the world, including the United States, during early calendar year 2020 has caused widespread business and economic disruption through mandated and voluntary business closings and restrictions on the movement and activities of people (COVID-19 Pandemic). The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic is rapidly evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where the Company operates. It is expected that many of the Company's customers and suppliers could be impacted by these closings and restrictions which could materially and adversely affect demand for our products, our ability to obtain or deliver inventory or services, and our ability to collect accounts receivables as customers face higher liquidity and solvency risk. Furthermore, capital markets and economies worldwide have also been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and it is possible that it could cause an economic downturn, recession, or depression. Such economic disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business. Policymakers around the world have responded with fiscal and monetary policy actions to support the economy. The magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remains uncertain.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable is reported on the balance sheet at the net amounts expected to be collected by the Company. Management closely monitors outstanding accounts receivable and charges off to expense any balances that are determined to be uncollectible which was $0 and $21,870 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Company had accounts receivable of $4,948,796 and $16,377, respectively. Accounts receivables are primarily generated from our subsidiaries in their normal course of business.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property, equipment or leasehold improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based on the following estimated useful lives:\nClassification Useful Life\nEquipment, furniture, and fixtures 5 - 7 years\nMedical equipment 10 years\nLeasehold improvements 10 years or lease term, if shorter\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived brands are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans. The Company believes such assumptions are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment. The Company based this decision on impairment testing of the underlying assets, expected cash flows, decreased asset value and other factors.\nValuation of long-lived assets\nIn accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360-10-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, all long-lived assets such as plant and equipment and construction in progress held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of assets to estimated discounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.\nThe Company applies the following five-step model to determine revenue recognition:\n\u00b7 Identification of a contract with a customer\n\u00b7 Identification of the performance obligations in the contact\n\u00b7 Determination of the transaction price\n\u00b7 Allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance allocation\n\u00b7 Recognition of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied\nThe Company only applies the five-step model when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised service is distinct.\nThe Companys financial services sector reports revenues as services are performed and its healthcare sector reports revenues at the time control of the services transfer to the customer and from providing licensed and/or certified orthopedic procedures. Our healthcare subsidiary does not have contract liabilities or deferred revenue as there are no amounts prepaid for services.\nEstablished billing rates are not the same as actual amounts recovered for our healthcare subsidiary. They generally do not reflect what the Company is ultimately paid and therefore are not reported in our consolidated financial statements. The Company is typically paid amounts based on established charges per procedure with guidance from the annually updated Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) guidelines (a code set maintained by the American Medical Association through the CPT Editorial Panel), that designates relative value units (RVU's) and a suggested range of charges for each procedure which is then assigned a CPT code.\nThis fee is discounted to reflect the percentage paid to the Company using a modifier recognized by each insurance carrier for services, less deductible, co-pay, and contractual adjustments which are deducted from the calculated fee. The net revenue is recorded at the time the services are rendered.\nContract Fees (Non-PIP)\nThe Company has contract fees for amounts earned from its Non-Personal Injury Protection (PIP) related procedures, typically car accidents, and are collected on a contingency basis. These cases are sold to a factor, who bears the risk of economic benefit or loss. After selling patient cases to the factor, any additional funds collected by the Company are remitted to the factor.\nService Fees - Net (PIP)\nThe Company generates services fees from performing various procedures on the date the services are performed. These services primarily include slip and falls as well as smaller nominal Non-PIP services. Fees are collected primarily from third party insurance providers. These revenues are based on established insurance billing rates less allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts. These contractual adjustments vary by insurance company and self-pay patients. The Company computes these contractual adjustments and collection allowances based on its historical collection experience.\nCompleting the paperwork for each case and preparing it for billing takes approximately ten business days after a procedure is performed. The majority of claims are then filed electronically except for those remaining insurance carriers requiring paper filing. An initial response is usually received within four weeks from electronic filing and up to six weeks from paper filing. Responses may be a payment, a denial, or a request for additional information.\nHistorical collection rates are estimated using the most current prior 12-month historical payment and collection percentages. The Company generally receives all of its collections within 12 months from the date of service. The Company accounts for chargebacks as they occur and records an estimate for expected chargebacks as they are received from insurance companies.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $0 and $21,870 of bad debt expense, respectively. Additionally, the Company has not recorded any estimate for expected chargebacks.\nThe Companys contracts for both its contract and service fees each contain a single performance obligation (providing orthopedic services), as the promise to transfer the individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, as a result, the entire transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\nAccordingly, the Company recognizes revenues (net) when the patient receives orthopedic care services. Our patient service contracts generally have performance obligations which are satisfied at a point in time. The performance obligation is for onsite or off-site care provided. Patient service contracts are generally fixed-price, and the transaction price is in the contract. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our patients are satisfied; generally, at the time of patient care.\nFinancial Services Income\nThe Company generates revenue from providing tax resolution services to individuals and business owners that have federal and state tax liabilities by assisting its clients to settle outstanding tax debts. Additionally, services include back taxes, offer in compromise, audit representation, amending tax returns, tax preparation, wage garnishment relief, removal of bank levies and liens, and other financial challenges. The Company recognizes revenues for these services as services are performed.\nRental Income\nThe Companys rent revenue is derived from the mobile home leases. The expired leases are considered month-to-month leases. In accordance with section ASC 842, the cost of property held for leasing by major classes of property according to nature or function, and the amount of accumulated depreciation in total, is presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. There are no contingent rentals included in income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. With the exception of the month-to-month leases, revenue was recognized on a straight-line basis and amortized into income on a monthly basis, over the lease term.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in members equity. The Company recognized advertising and marketing expense of $1,301,050 and $1,511,955 for the years ended December 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nValuation of Derivative Instruments\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815-10), requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with freestanding derivative instruments such as convertible promissory notes, on their issuance date to determine whether they would be considered a derivative liability and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. The Company evaluates all of it financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then revalued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.\nFor option based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\nBeneficial Conversion Feature\nFor conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records a beneficial conversion feature (BCF) discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument (offset to additional paid in capital).\nWhen the Company records a BCF which is not a conventional convertible, the fair value of the BCF is recorded as a derivative liability with an offset against the face amount of the respective debt instrument which is amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs), and (2) an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel Input Definition\nLevel 1 Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.\nLevel 3\nUnobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under the recognition and measurement principles of the fair value recognition provisions of section 718-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-30-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nThe measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.\nGenerally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, based on estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nThe expense resulting from share-based payments is recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services\nThe Company early adopted ASU No 2018-07 for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are determined in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nFor the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.\nLoss per Share\nFASB ASC Subtopic 260, Earnings Per Share (ASC 260), provides for the calculation of \"Basic\" and \"Diluted\" earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, warrants, and debts convertible into common shares. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Companys Common Stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained operating losses since its inception and has negative working capital and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubts about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has sustained recurring losses and accumulated a working capital deficit of approximately $5,975,487. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusions. Management has prospective investors and believes the raising of capital will allow the Company to fund its cash flow shortfalls and pursue new acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient capital from debt or equity transactions or from operations in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to it. Should the Company be unable to raise sufficient funds, it may be required to curtail its operating plans. In addition, increases in expenses may require cost reductions. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future. Should the Company not be able to raise sufficient funds, it may cause cessation of operations.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 (ASU 2020-06) Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the cash conversion and beneficial conversion accounting models. As a result, the Companys convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. For contracts in an entitys own equity, the type of contracts primarily affected by this update are freestanding and embedded features that are accounted for as derivatives under the current guidance due to a failure to meet the settlement conditions of the derivative scope exception. Management has adopted ASU 2020-06 as of the filing of this December 31, 2021 Form 10-K. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, we reclassified the previously identified beneficial conversion features to the associated debt. We also determined, that in accordance with ASU 2017-11, such beneficial conversion features are not considered a liability classified derivative.\nChanges to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) to the FASB's Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASU's on our financial position, results of operations, shareholders deficit. cash flows, or presentation thereof.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which supersedes current guidance by requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. The new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets including trade and other receivables at each reporting date. The new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments -- Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842), which extends the effective date of Topic 326 for certain companies until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted.\nManagement does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nReclassifications\nCertain accounts relating to the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the net income or net assets as previously reported.\n2. RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSubsequent to the initial issuance of the Company's 2020 financial statements on March 31, 2021, management reconsidered the methodology previously applied in its valuation of derivative liabilities contained in its matured convertible notes which are in default, to include all inputs to measure the time value component to the application of the Black-Scholes Model. In addition, management also discovered that it did not reflect the impact of amendments which resulted in modifications in certain rights and privileges for certain classes of its preferred stock, which should have been accounted for as a deemed dividend at the time of modification.\nThe restatement primarily relates to the accounting for (1) the valuation of embedded derivative liabilities in certain matured convertible notes and (2) the accounting treatment for changes in certain rights and privileges with respect to certain classes of preferred stock on January 10, 2020.\n(1) For certain convertible notes in default containing embedded derivatives (the \"Notes\"), the Company originally valued the derivative liability using a Black-Scholes Model, but without consideration to a time value component (the term, volatility, or discount rates), because these notes had matured and were immediately due. As a result, the embedded derivatives for expired notes were measured using a valuation methodology which was analogous to the use of intrinsic value. Company management has reconsidered the methodology previously applied, and determined that the use of all inputs to the Black-Scholes Model is more appropriate in the determination to measure the fair value of all derivative liabilities.\n(2) The Company originally did not reflect the impact of amendments which resulted in modifications in certain rights and privileges for certain classes of its preferred stock.

GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nThe following table shows our goodwill balances by reportable segment. We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Since the date of our last quarterly assessment, we have not identified any changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable.\nAllocation of Goodwill to Reporting Segments\nThe following table shows our goodwill balances by reportable segment:\nAffordable\nHousing Rentals\nFinancial\nServices\nHealthcare Total\nGross carrying value at December 31, 2020 $ - $ 3,499,963 $ - $ 3,499,963\nAccumulated impairment - - - -\nCarrying value at December 31, 2020 - 3,499,963 - 3,499,963\nAcquisition - - 2,391,608 2,391,608\nAccumulated impairment - - - -\nCarrying value at December 31, 2021 $ - $ 2,092,048 $ 2,391,608 $ 4,483,656\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases\nASC 842, Leases, requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases, A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transaction, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at either the effective date (the effective date method) or the beginning of the earliest period presented (the comparative method) using a modified retrospective approach. Under the effective date method, the Companys comparative period reporting is unchanged. In contrast, under the comparative method, the Companys date of initial application is the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, and the Topic 842 transition guidance is then applied to all comparative periods presented. Further, under either transition method, the standard includes certain practical expedients intended to ease the burden of adoption. The Company adopted ASC 842, January 1, 2020, using the effective date method and elected certain practical expedients allowing the Company not to reassess:\n\u00b7 whether expired or existing contracts contain leases under the new definition of a lease;\n\u00b7 lease classification for expired or existing leases; and\n\u00b7 whether previously capitalized initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under Topic 842.\nThe Company also made the accounting policy decision not to recognize lease assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less.\nThe Company recorded operating lease expense of $185,831 and $87,649 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company has operating leases with future commitments as follows:\nAmount\n$ 166,568\n77,697\n35,527\n22,215\nTotal $ 302,007\nEmployees\nThe Company agreed to pay $360,000 per year and a $200,000 of target annual incentive granted in 2020 to the Chief Executive Officer based on his employment agreement since July 1, 2020 of which currently 50% is paid in cash and 50% is accrued. The Company previously paid the Chief Executive Officer $300,000 per year. The total outstanding accrued compensation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $1,385,000 and $1,035,000, respectively.\nThe Company agreed to pay $360,000 per year and a $200,000 of target annual incentive to the Chairman of the Board based on his employment agreement since July 1, 2020 of which currently 50% is paid in cash and 50% is accrued. The Company previously paid the Chairman of the Board $300,000 per year.

In the third quarter of 2021, the Chief Operating Officer received 61,000 shares of preferred stock series B in exchange for accrued salaries of $244,000. The total outstanding accrued compensation as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $159,000 and $120,000, respectively.\nThe Company agreed to pay $156,000 per year to the Chief Financial Officer based on his amended employment agreement executed on May 15, 2021. The total outstanding accrued compensation as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $17,057.\nThe Company entered into a Management Agreement effective May 31, 2021 for compensation to the Principals of the Companys Nova Ortho and Spine (Nova) subsidiary in the form of an annual base salaries of $372,000 to one of the 3 doctors, $450,000 to the second, and $372,000 to the third doctor.\nCollectively, as a group, Principals of Nova will receive an annual cash bonus and stock equity set forth in footnote 8 (the Annual Bonus). The Annual Bonus will be conditioned upon the Company achieving 100% of the annual objectives of financial performance goals as set forth in footnote 8.\nWe have an employment agreement with subsidiary managers, effective May 31, 2019 with a term of 5 years, whereby we provide for compensation of $17,333 per month along with a bonus incentive if financial performance measures are met.\nWe have an employment agreement with a subsidiary manager, effective July 1, 2018 with a term of 5 years, whereby we provide for compensation of $20,000 per month along with a bonus incentive if financial performance measures are met.\nWe acquired Redrock Travel on May 1, 2018. After numerous violations of the Management Agreement it was determined by our board of directors to terminate the acquisition agreement and to file for the cancelation of the Redrock Stock Class with the State of Florida. A declaration has been served notifying Red Rock and its investors the Board nor officer of the Company approved any transactions entered into with Red Rock. The Company is waiting for a response.\nOn August 6, 2021, a Board Resolution was executed to terminate one of the two employees of Edge View Properties for fraud, deceit, larceny, and thievery for selling property belonging to the Company and personally taking the $162,598 in proceeds. The Company hired counsel to terminate the employee and handle all legal matters for return of monies and criminal prosecution.\n16. INCOME TAXES\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17,330,000 that expire in various years through the year 2038.\nDue to operating losses, there is no provision for current federal or state income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for federal and state income tax purposes.\nThe Companys deferred tax asset at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consists of net operating loss carry forwards calculated using federal and state effective tax rates equating to approximately $4,991,000 and $4,391,000, respectively, less a valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $4,991,000 and $4,391,000, respectively. Because of the Companys lack of earnings history, the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance in both 2021 and 2020. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $600,000 from the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Companys total deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nDeferred tax assets $ 4,991,000 $ 4,391,000\nValuation allowance (4,991,000 ) (4,391,000 )\nNet deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act) was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Companys current interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance.\n17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nGeneral Matters\nFebruary 17, 2022 - The Company concluded that the Companys previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2020 10-K) and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended and year-to-date period ended March 31, 2021 (the 2021 Q-1 10-Q) (the periods covered by the 2020 10-K and the 2021 Q-1 10-Q being referred to herein as the Affected Periods) should no longer be relied upon. The Company filed an amendment to its 2020 10-K to restate its financial annual statements and disclose the impact of the restatement on previously reported quarterly amounts for the Affected Periods. The restatement primarily related to the accounting for (1) the valuation of embedded derivative liabilities in certain matured convertible notes and (2) the accounting treatment for changes in certain rights and privileges with respect to certain classes of preferred stock on January 10, 2020. The quantification of this restatement is summarized in Note 2.\nOn March 15, 2022 the Company settled a $40,000 promissory note between Red Rock Travel and note holder. The settlement amount was $13,333 payable by the issuance of common shares of stock.\nJune 27, 2022 - The Board of Directors confirms the transfer of 1,000,000,000 share from Cardiff Acquisition & Growth Fund to treasury.\nJuly 15, 2022 - Entered into a new agreement to represent the Company in the Edge View Properties lawsuit.\nJuly 29, 2022 Settlement Agreement Signed by Red Rock Travel all parties agreed to the negotiated terms.\nStock Issuances:\nMarch 31, 2022 - 1,275,427 preferred shares were returned to treasury.\nApril 28, 2022 - 37,500 preferred shares were issued in exchange for 37,500 preferred shares of a different class of preferred.

SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company has four reportable operating segments as determined by management using the management approach as defined by the authoritative guidance on Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information:\n(1) Affordable Housing (We Three),\n(2) Tax Resolution Services (Platinum Tax and Key Tax (Divested as of December 31, 2021))\n(3) Real Estate (Edge View)\n(4) Healthcare (Nova Ortho)\nThese segments are a result of differences in the nature of the products and services sold. Corporate administration costs, which include, but are not limited to, general accounting, human resources, legal and credit and collections, are partially allocated to the three operating segments. Other revenue consists of nonrecurring items.\nThe Affordable Housing segment leases and sells mobile homes as an option for a homeowner wishing to avoid large down payments, expensive maintenance costs, large monthly mortgage payments and high property taxes and insurance which is a common trait of brick and mortar homes. Additionally, if bad credit is an issue preventing potential homeowners from purchasing a traditional house, the Company will provide a \"lease to own\" option so people secure their family home.\nPlatinum Tax and Key Tax (divested as of December 31, 2021) provides tax resolution services to individuals and companies that have federal and state tax liabilities. The company collects fees based on efforts to negotiate and assist in the settlement of outstanding tax debts.\nEdge View consists of 30 prime acres of land; 23.5 acres zoned MDR (Medium Density Residential) with 12 lots already platted and 48 lots zoned HDR (High Density Residential), 4 acres of dedicated river front property zoned for recreation on the Salmon River, Idahos premier whitewater river and 2.5 acres zoned for commercial use. All land is in the city limits of Salmon and adjacent to the Frank church Wilderness Park (the largest wilderness park in the lower 48 states).\nNova Ortho and Spine is a group of doctors that provide a full range of diagnostic and surgical services for injuries and disorders of the skeletal system and associated bones, joints, tendons, muscles, ligaments, and nerves.\nManagement uses numerous tools and methods to evaluate and measure of its subsidiaries success. To help succeed, management retains the prior owners of the subsidiaries and allow them to do what they do best is run the business.

There were no disagreements with Daszkal Bolton at the time of non-reengagement.\nOn June 24, 2021, the Company engaged Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman & Company (RRBB) to be its independent registered public accounting firm. On March 16, 2022, management terminated RRBB from being its independent registered public accounting firm. There were no disagreements with RRBB at the time of termination.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Company engaged Grassi & CO., CPAs, P.C. to be its independent registered public accounting firm. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision of and with the participation of its executive officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the executive officers of the Company has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this Annual Report, these disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer (our president) and our principal accounting and financial officer (our chief financial officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluation the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but no absolute, assurance that the objectives of a control system are met. Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources and benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs. These limitations also include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control. A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future condition; over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the year-end period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act, and assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses:\n1. As of December 31, 2021, our controls over the control environment were not effective. Specifically, we have not developed and effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedure. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further, the Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness.\n2. As of December 31, 2021, our controls over financial statement disclosure were not effective. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, management has determined that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness.\n3. Lack of formal documentation over internal control procedures and environment.\n4. Lack of proper segregation of duties and multiple level of reviews.\n5. Lack of expertise in accounting of derivative liabilities.\nBecause of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nWe had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that have affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We may advance expenses incurred in defended a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defended the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Florida.\nRegarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Florida law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
