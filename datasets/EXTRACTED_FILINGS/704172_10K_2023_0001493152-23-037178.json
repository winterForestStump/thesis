    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW\nINTRODUCTION\nPHI Group, Inc. (n/k/a Philux Global Group Inc) (the Company or PHI) (www.philuxglobal.com) is primarily engaged in mergers and acquisitions, advancing Philux Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a Reserved Alternative Investment Fund (RAIF) under the laws of Luxembourg, and developing the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam. Besides, the Company provides corporate finance services, including merger and acquisition advisory and consulting services for client companies through our wholly owned subsidiary Philux Capital Advisors, Inc. (formerly PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.) (www.philuxcapital.com) and invests in selective industries and special situations aiming to potentially create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Philux Global Funds intends to include a number of sub-funds for investment in select growth opportunities in the areas of renewable energy, real estate, infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture, and the Asia Diamond Exchange in conjunction with the International Financial Center in Vietnam.\nBACKGROUND\nOriginally incorporated on June 8, 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., a Nevada corporation, the Company applied for a Certificate of Domestication and filed Articles of Domestication to become a Wyoming corporation on September 20, 2017. In the beginning, the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New York and one in California. In January 2000, the Company changed its name to Providential Securities, Inc., a Nevada corporation, following a business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based financial services company. In February 2000, the Company then changed its name to Providential Holdings, Inc. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership and ceased its financial services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October 2000 to October 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in various transactions in connection with mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations. In October 2011, the Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation (together with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation - US, and Philand Vietnam Ltd. - Vietnam), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly PHI Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation (a Nevada corporation), and mainly focused on acquisition and development opportunities in energy and natural resource businesses.\nThe Company is currently focused on Philux Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF by launching Philux Global Select Growth Fund and potentially other sub-funds for investment in real estate, renewable energy, infrastructure, agriculture, healthcare and the International Financial Center and Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam. In addition, Philux Capital Advisors, Inc. (formerly Capital Holdings, Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, continues to provide corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory and consulting services for U.S. and international companies. The Company has also formed Philux Global Advisors, Inc. to serve as the investment advisor to Philux Global Funds and other potential fund clients in the future.\nThe Company had signed agreements to acquire majority equity interests in Kota Construction LLC and Kota Energy Group LLC (KOTA) which are engaged in solar energy business (https://www.kotasolar.com), and Tin Thanh Group, a Vietnamese joint stock company (www.tinthanhgroup.vn) (TTG). Whereas the scheduled closing dates for the KOTA and TTG transactions already expired, the Company has continued to discuss with these companies and intends to renegotiate an revised agreement with each of them when the Company successfully closes one or more of the pending asset management agreements and financing with certain investor groups and lenders. In addition, the Company intends to amend the Purchase and Sale Agreement that was originally signed on January 18, 2022 with Five-Grain Treasure Spirits Co., Ltd., a Chinese baiju distiller, to collaborate in launching American-made baiju products through Empire Spirits, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company. The Company is in the process of establishing a subsidiary in the Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre in United Arab Emirates to replace its former subsidiary CO2-1-0 (CARBON) Corp. to continue engaging in carbon emission mitigation using blockchain and crypto technologies. In May 2023, the company signed a business cooperation agreement with SSE Global JSC, a Vietnamese joint stock company, to establish SSE Global Group, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, (www.sseglobalgroup.com) to commercialize a self-sustainable energy technology. In addition, in June 2023 the Company signed a business cooperation agreement with Saphia Alkali JSC, a Vietnamese joint stock company, to form Sapphire Alkali Global Group in the United States to finance, manufacture, sell and distribute Saphia Alkalis proprietary products on a worldwide basis. These activities are disclosed in greater detail elsewhere in this report. No assurances can be made that the Company will be successful in achieving its plans.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nPHIs strategy is to:\n1. Identify, build, acquire, commit and deploy valuable resources with distinctive competitive advantages;\n2. Identify, evaluate, acquire, participate and compete in attractive businesses that have large, growing market potential;\n3. Build an attractive investment that includes points of exit for investors through capital appreciation or spin-offs of business units.\nSUBSIDIARIES:\nAs of October 13, 2023, the Company has the following subsidiaries: (1) Asia Diamond Exchange, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), (2) American Pacific Resources, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%, (3) Empire Spirits, Inc., a Nevada corporation (85% - formerly Provimex, Inc.) (4) Philux Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a Luxembourg Reserved Alternative Investment Fund (100%), (5) Philux Luxembourg Development S.A., a Luxembourg corporation (100%), (6) PHI Luxembourg Holding SA, a Luxembourg corporation (100%), (7) Philux Global General Partners SA, a Luxembourg corporation (100%), (8) Philux Capital Advisors, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), (9) Philux Global Advisors, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), (10) Philux Global Healthcare, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), (11) Philux Global Trade Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), (12) Philux Global Energy Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), and (13) Philux Global Vietnam Investment and Development Company Ltd., a Vietnamese limited liability company (100%).\nAMERICAN PACIFIC RESOURCES, INC.\nAmerican Pacific Resources, Inc. (APR) is a Wyoming corporation established in April 2016 as a subsidiary of the Company to serve as a holding company for various natural resource projects. On September 2, 2017, APR entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale with Rush Gold Royalty, Inc. (RGR), a Wyoming corporation, to acquire a 51% ownership in twenty-one mining claims over an area of approximately 400 acres in Granite Mining District, Grant County, Oregon, U.S.A., in exchange for a total purchase price of twenty-five million U.S. Dollars ($US 25,000,000) to be paid in a combination of cash, convertible demand promissory note and PHI Group, Inc.s Class A Series II Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock). This transaction was closed effective October 3, 2017. Following the first amendment dated April 19, 2018 and the second amendment dated September 29, 2018 retroactively effective April 20, 2018, to the afore-mentioned Agreement of Purchase and Sale, PHI Group, Inc. paid ten million shares of its Class A Series II Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to Rush Gold Royalty, Inc.. As of June 30, 2020, the Company recorded $462,000 paid for this transaction as expenses for research and development in connection with the Granite Mining Claims project. The value of these mining claims is expected to be adjusted later after a new valuation of these mining assets is conducted by an independent third-party valuator.\nThe Company has passed several resolutions with respect to the declaration of a twenty percent (20%) special stock dividend in American Pacific Resources, Inc. to shareholders of Common Stock of the Company. Due to the continued adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic and other factors that have delayed the development of APR, it has deemed necessary for the Company to suspend the distribution of the APR special stock dividend until later on in order to allow APR additional time to reach certain milestones that would make the spin-off of APR and this special stock dividend distribution economically beneficial for the Companys shareholders. The Company will provide an update regarding the new Record Date for this special dividend when certain conditions are met.\nASIA DIAMOND EXCHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTER IN VIETNAM\nAlong with the establishment of Philux Global Funds, the Company has worked with the Authority of Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Central Vietnam and the Provinces of Quang Nam and Dong Nai, Vietnam, to develop the Asia Diamond Exchange for lab-grown, rough and polished diamond together with a multi-commodities and logistics centers.\nMr. Ben Smet who successfully established the Dubai Diamond Exchange in 2002-2005 has been leading fulltime a group of experts for the setup of the Asian Diamond Exchange since January 2018. He has brought together the 11 main trading players in the rough diamond industry to come to Vietnam. He has established a partnership with the biggest player in the rough trading and polishing group, the Mehta Family Group. Other main international diamond trading groups as the Mody Group, Diamac etc. have joined the overall venture.\nFurthermore, together with the groups, a full Kimberly Process Certification Scheme (KPC) to prevent \u2018conflicting diamond trading was established and is aligned from time to time. Also, the new lab grown diamond KPC scheduling is already implemented. A unique and KPC approved structure has been established where under the PHI Vietnam umbrella, in collaboration with KPC Mum- bai (India), a \u2018Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) is established in which the Vietnamese authorities hold 15% and PHI (or its local corporate entity) holds 85% of the voting rights. For the lab grown diamond segment, this will be in the Chu Lai Free Economic Zone and for the Rough and Polished Diamond Parcel Trade, this is being planned to be on Thanh Da Island, about 5 kilometers from the center of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\nThe Company has taken the decision to move the greater part of the ADE rough and polishing venture, first to an Industrial Zone to be established close to the new international Airport in Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam and this year to the Thanh Da Island. This location change has caused that the entire KPC Process and administration had to be adapted and redone with renewed financial input, mostly carried by Mr. Smet.\nA rough diamond trading export flow to Vietnam was negotiated and concluded by Mr. Smet with the DMCC and Dubai Diamond Exchange. This year, an international diamond trading platform was created by Mr. Smet to unify the trading efforts of Alrosa and De Beers/Bonas. Mr. Smet was advised and counselled thereto by Mr. A. Mehta, the senior board member of the Alrosa Group. Together with Mr. A. Mehta, Mr. Smet has also covered the financial backbone of the diamond trading venture via the setup of a financial institution in Botswana. It is the intention of Mr. Smet to donate 50% of his own voting shares of the institution to PHI the moment all budgets for the venture are arranged by PHI and all financial obligations and reimbursements by PHI to him are met. It is the intention of the parties involved to establish a subsidiary of the financial institution in the ADE Vietnam and have local banking partners join this initiative.\nMr. Smet had also established a collaboration partnership with the Antwerp Diamond Exchange (Belgium), the Dubai Diamond Exchange and the Tel-Aviv Diamond Exchange. Negotiations have started to involve a new economic free-zone in Jordan into the ongoing project.\nRecently, Mr. Smet has started a structuring project, in order for PHI to set up and establish an International Financial Center on the Thanh Da Island in connection with the Asian Diamond Exchange. This will be similar as what Mr. Smet has established successfully for Dubai in 2002-2005 and this now incorporating the international changes of the last decade.\nOnce the Company has effectuated all budgeting and all financial requirements and obligations, the ongoing process will effectively materialize and Mr. Smet then shall transfer the entire venture to Philux Global Group, Inc.\nThe Company has incorporated Asia Diamond Exchange, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, ID number 2021-001010234, as the holding company for the development of the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam.\nCO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP\nIn August 2022, PHI Group signed a Letter of Intent with Indonesia-based CYFS Group, headed by Mr. Choky Fernando Simanjuntak, to sponsor and co-found CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP to implement a new disruptive carbon mitigation initiative through environmentally sustainable projects starting in Indonesia, Vietnam, other ASEAN countries, and worldwide. On September 21, 2022 CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP was incorporated as a Wyoming corporation to manage this program. The Company has contributed the development budget for CO2-1-0 (CARBON) CORP) and plans to establish a subsidiary in the Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre to the United Arab Emirates to replace CO2-1-0 (CARBON).\nEMPIRE SPIRITS, INC. (FORMERLY PROVIMEX, INC.)\nProvimex, Inc. was originally incorporated as a Nevada corporation on September 23, 2004, Entity Number C25551-4, as a subsidiary of the Company to engage in international trade. On 9/26/2021, Provimex, Inc. changed its name to Empire Spirits, Inc. as the holding company for the acquisition of a majority ownership in Five-Grain Treasure Spirits Company, Ltd., a baiju distiller in Jilin Province. The Company is in the process of amending the Purchase and Sale Agreement that was originally signed on January 18, 2022 with Five-Grain Treasure Spirits Co. Ltd., to collaborate in launching American-made baiju products through Empire Spirits, Inc.\nBaijiu is a white spirit distilled from sorghum. It is similar to vodka but with a fragrant aroma and taste. It is currently the most consumed spirit in the world. Mainly consumed in China, it is gaining popularity in the rest of the world.\nFive-Grain specializes in the production and sales of spirits and the development of proprietary spirit production processes. It also possesses a patented technology to grow red sorghum for baiju manufacturing. The patented grain produces superior yield and quality. Five-Grain is a reputable bulk alcohol supplier to some of the largest spirits companies in the world.\nPHILUX GLOBAL FUNDS SCA, SICAV-RAIF\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company received the approval from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) and successfully established and activated PHILUX GLOBAL FUNDS SCA, SICAV-RAIF (the Fund), Registration No. B244952, a Luxembourg bank fund organized as a Reserved Alternative Investment Fund in accordance with the Luxembourg Law of July 23, 2016 relative to reserved alternative investment funds, Law of August 23, 2016 relative to commercial companies, and Modified Law of July 12, 2013 relative to alternative investment fund managers.\nThe following entities had been engaged to support the Funds operations: a) Custodian Bank: Hauck & Aufhauser Privatbankiers AG, b) Administrative Registrar & Transfer Agent: Hauck & Aufhauser Alternative Investment Services S.A., c) Fund Manager: Hauck & Aufhauser Fund Services S.A., d) Fund Attorneys: DLP Law Firm SARL and VCI Legal, e) Investment Advisor: PHILUX Capital Advisors, Inc., f) Fund Auditors: E&Y Luxembourg and E&Y Vietnam, g) Fund Tax Advisor: ATOZ Tax Management, Luxembourg, h) Fund Independent Asset Valuator: Cushman & Wakefield, Vietnam.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nInvestment in our securities is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. The following sets forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss.\nGeneral Risks Related to Our Business\nOur success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur future success will depend in substantial part on the continued service of our senior management and certain external experts. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel and/or outside experts could impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or employees. Our future success will also depend on the continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing our operations. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we will be able to attract, train or retain qualified personnel in the future.\nRisks Related to Mergers and Acquisitions\nOur strategy in mergers and acquisitions involves a number of risks and we have a limited history of successful acquisitions. Even when an acquisition is completed, we may have to continue our service for integration that may not produce results as positive as management may have projected.\nThe Company continues evaluating various opportunities and negotiating to acquire other companies, assets and technologies. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and products, diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees of acquired companies. We have limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations into our operations. Although potential synergy may be achieved by acquisitions of related technologies and businesses, no assurance can be given as to the Companys ability to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that have been acquired or might be acquired in the future. Failure to successfully assimilate acquired organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and operating results.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results;\n\u25cf diversion of managements attention;\n\u25cf failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf additional financing, if necessary and available, could increase leverage, dilute equity, or both;\n\u25cf the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles; and\n\u25cf the high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition since the values of the securities received for the consulting service at the execution of the acquisition depend on the success of the company involved in acquisition. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations through acquisitions may be dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient working capital, either through cash flows generated through operations or financing activities or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nRisks associated with private equity (PE) funds\nThere are, broadly, five key risks to private equity investing:\n1. Operational risk: The risk of loss resulting from inadequate processes and systems supporting the organization. It is a key consideration for investors regardless of the asset classes that funds invest into.\n2. Funding risk: This is the risk that investors are not able to provide their capital commitments and is effectively the \u2018investor default risk. PE funds typically do not call upon all the committed investor capital and only draw capital once they have identified investments. Funding risk is closely related to liquidity risk, as when investors are faced with a funding shortfall they may be forced to sell illiquid assets to meet their commitments.\n3. Liquidity risk: This refers to an investors inability to redeem their investment at any given time. PE investors are \u2018locked-in for between five and ten years, or more, and are unable to redeem their committed capital on request during that period. Additionally, given the lack of an active market for the underlying investments, it is difficult to estimate when the investment can be realized and at what valuation.\n4. Market risk: There are many forms of market risk affecting PE investments, such as broad equity market exposure, geographical/sector exposure, foreign exchange, commodity prices, and interest rates. Unlike in public markets where prices fluctuate constantly and are marked-to-market, PE investments are subject to infrequent valuations and are typically valued quarterly and with some element of subjectivity inherent in the assessment. However, the market prices of publicly listed equities at the time of sale of a portfolio company will ultimately impact realization value.\n5. Capital risk: The capital at risk is equal to the net asset value of the unrealized portfolio plus the future undrawn commitments. In theory, there is a risk that all portfolio companies could experience a decline in their current value, and in the worst-case drop to a valuation of zero. Capital risk is closely related to market risk. Whilst market risk is the uncertainty associated with unrealized gains or losses, capital risk is the possibility of having a realized loss of the original capital at the end of a funds life.\nThere are two main ways that capital risk brings itself to bear - through the failure of underlying companies within the PE portfolio and suppressed equity prices which make exits less attractive. The former is impacted by the quality of the fund manager, i.e. their ability to select portfolio companies with good growth prospects and to create value, hence why fund manager selection is key for investors. The condition, method, and timing of the exit are all factors that can affect how value can be created for investors.\nRisks Associated with Building and Operating a Diamond Exchange\nFundamentally, the key requirements for a successful diamond exchange include the following:\n1. Supply: One of the most important things for a successful trading hub is the ability to secure ample, stable, and sustainable supply of commodities. In the case of a diamond exchange, adequate supply of rough diamond must be secured to make it successful.\n2. Capital: Besides the infrastructure, facilities, systems, and amenities to operate the diamond exchange, the organizers must be able to arrange very large amounts of capital to facilitate the trade and other business activities related to the exchange.\n3. Participants: The organizers must be able to attract a large number of international diamonteers to participate in the exchange. There is no guarantee that people will come when the exchange is built.\n4. Venue: The venue must be able to provide competitive advantages compared with existing diamond exchanges in the world in terms of (a) modern facilities, latest technologies and state-of-the-art provisions, (b) tax relief, (c) financial facilitating network from big investors, (d) retail banking, lending institutions and foreign exchange facilities, (e) licenses and registrations, (f) global multi-commodities trading flatform, and (g) other amenities.\nRisks Associated with International Markets\nAs some of our business activities are currently involved with international markets, any adverse change to the economy or business environment in these countries could significantly affect our operations, which would lead to lower revenues and reduced profitability.\nSome of our business activities are currently involved with non-US countries. Because of this presence in specific geographic locations, we are susceptible to fluctuations in our business caused by adverse economic or other conditions in this region, including stock market fluctuation. A stagnant or depressed economy in these countries generally, or in any of the other markets that we serve, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nInsiders have substantial control over the company, and they could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control, even if our other stockholders wanted such a change to occur.\nThough our executive officers and directors as of the date of this report, in the aggregate, only hold a small portion of our outstanding common stock, we have the majority voting rights associated with the Companys Class B Series I Preferred Stock, which decision may allow the Board of Directors to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur.\nThe price at which investors purchase our common stock may not be indicative of the prevailing market price.\nThe stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. Investors may be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses.\nSince we do not currently meet the requirements for our stock to be quoted on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT LLC or any other senior exchange, the tradability in our securities will be limited under the penny stock regulations.\nUnder the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the price of our securities on the OTCQB or OTC Markets is below $5.00 per share, our securities are within the definition of a penny stock. As a result, it is possible that our securities may be subject to the penny stock rules and regulations. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the Commissions regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to:\n*Make a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser;\n*Receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction; and\n*Provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser.\nThese requirements may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may affect the ability to resell our securities.\nOur compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us.\nIt may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance staff in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires publicly traded companies to obtain. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone. ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company did not own any realty or equipment. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is currently not a party to any material pending legal proceedings and, to the best of its knowledge, no such action by or against Company has been threatened. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\nNone\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe Companys Common Stock is currently trading on the OTC Markets under the symbol PHIL. The following sets forth the high and low prices of the Companys Common Stock in the US for the most recent month, two most recent quarters and each quarter during the preceding two fiscal years.\nThe prices for the Companys common stock quoted by brokers are not necessarily a reliable indication of the value of the Companys common stock.\nPer Share Common Stock Prices for the Month High Low\nEnded September 30, 2023 0.0006 0.0004\nPer Share Common Stock Prices for the Quarter High Low\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2023 0.0008 0.0005\nPer Share Common Stock Prices by Quarter\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023\nHigh Low\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2023 0.0008 0.0005\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2023 0.0025 0.0001\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2022 0.0020 0.0008\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2022 0.0026 0.0005\nPer Share Common Stock Prices by Quarter\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\nHigh Low\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2022 0.0019 0.0005\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2022 0.0055 0.0016\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2021 0.0093 0.0047\nQuarter Ended September 30, 2021 0.0150 0.0047\nHolders of Common Equity:\nAs of October 13, 2023 there are approximately 1,605 shareholders of record of the Companys common stock, of which 1,299 are active.\nDividends:\nCash dividend: The Company has not declared or paid a cash dividend to common stock shareholders since the Companys inception. The Board of Directors presently intends to retain any earnings to finance company operations and does not expect to authorize cash dividends to common shareholders in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon Companys earnings, capital requirements and other factors.\nShare dividend: On March 12, 2012 the Board of Directors of the Company declared a special stock dividend to shareholders of Common Stock of the Company with the following stipulations: (a) Declaration date: March 16, 2012; (b) Record date: June 15, 2012; (c) Payment date: September 17, 2012; (d) Dividend ratio: All eligible shareholders of Common Stock of the Company as of the Record date shall receive three new shares of Common Stock of the Company for each share held by such shareholders as of the referenced record date. The purpose of this special stock dividend was to partially mitigate the impact of the dilution in connection with the 1-for-1,500 reverse split of the Common Stock on the Companys long-term shareholders and reward them for staying with the Company. On June 6, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors passed a resolution to change the record date for the special stock dividend to July 31, 2012 and the distribution date to November 30, 2012.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(a/k/a PHILUX GLOBAL GROUP INC)\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS\nPHI Group, Inc. (n/k/a Philux Global Group Inc) (the Company or PHI) (www.philuxglobal.com) is primarily engaged in mergers and acquisitions, advancing Philux Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a Reserved Alternative Investment Fund (RAIF) under the laws of Luxembourg, and developing the Asia Diamond Exchange in Vietnam. Besides, the Company provides corporate finance services, including merger and acquisition advisory and consulting services for client companies through our wholly owned subsidiary Philux Capital Advisors, Inc. (formerly PHI Capital Holdings, Inc.) (www.philuxcapital.com) and invests in selective industries and special situations aiming to potentially create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Philux Global Funds intends to include a number of sub-funds for investment in select growth opportunities in the areas of renewable energy, real estate, infrastructure, healthcare, agriculture and the Asia Diamond Exchange in together with the International Financial Center in Vietnam.\nBACKGROUND\nOriginally incorporated on June 8, 1982 as JR Consulting, Inc., a Nevada corporation, the Company applied for a Certificate of Domestication and filed Articles of Domestication to become a Wyoming corporation on September 20, 2017. In the beginning, the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions and had an operating subsidiary, Diva Entertainment, Inc., which operated two modeling agencies, one in New York and one in California. In January 2000, the Company changed its name to Providential Securities, Inc., a Nevada corporation, following a business combination with Providential Securities, Inc., a California-based financial services company. In February 2000, the Company then changed its name to Providential Holdings, Inc. In October 2000, Providential Securities withdrew its securities brokerage membership and ceased its financial services business. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc. From October 2000 to October 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in various transactions in connection with mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare, private equity, and special situations. In October 2011, the Company discontinued the operations of Providential Vietnam Ltd., Philand Ranch Limited, a United Kingdom corporation (together with its subsidiaries Philand Ranch - Singapore, Philand Corporation - US, and Philand Vietnam Ltd. - Vietnam), PHI Gold Corporation (formerly PHI Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation), and PHI Energy Corporation (a Nevada corporation), and mainly focused on acquisition and development opportunities in energy and natural resource businesses.\nThe Company is currently focused on Philux Global Funds, SCA, SICAV-RAIF by launching Philux Global Select Growth Fund and potentially other sub-funds for investment in real estate, renewable energy, infrastructure, agriculture, healthcare and the Asia Diamond Exchange and International Financial Center in Vietnam. In addition, Philux Capital Advisors, Inc. (formerly Capital Holdings, Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, continues to provide corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory and consulting services for U.S. and international companies. The Company has also formed Philux Global Advisors, Inc. to serve as the investment advisor to Philux Global Funds and other potential fund clients in the future.\nThe Company had signed agreements to acquire majority equity interests in Kota Construction LLC and Kota Energy Group LLC (KOTA) which are engaged in solar energy business (https://www.kotasolar.com), and Tin Thanh Group, a Vietnamese joint stock company (www.tinthanhgroup.vn) (TTG). Whereas the scheduled closing dates for the KOTA and TTG transactions already expired, the Company has continued to discuss with these companies and intends to renegotiate an revised agreement with each of them when the Company successfully closes one or more of the pending asset management agreements and financing with certain investor groups and lenders. In addition, the Company intends to amend the Purchase and Sale Agreement that was originally signed on January 18, 2022 with Five-Grain Treasure Spirits Co., Ltd., a Chinese baiju distiller, to collaborate in launching American-made baiju products through Empire Spirits, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company. The Company is in the process of establishing a subsidiary in the Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre in United Arab Emirates to replace its former subsidiary CO2-1-0 (CARBON) Corp. to continue engaging in carbon emission mitigation using blockchain and crypto technologies. In May 2023, the company signed a business cooperation agreement with SSE Global JSC, a Vietnamese joint stock company, to establish SSE Global Group, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, (www.sseglobalgroup.com) to commercialize a self-sustainable energy technology. In addition, in June 2023 the Company signed a business cooperation agreement with Saphia Alkali JSC, a Vietnamese joint stock company, to form Sapphire Alkali Global Group in the United States to finance, manufacture, sell and distribute Saphia Alkalis proprietary products on a worldwide basis. These activities are disclosed in greater detail elsewhere in this report. No assurances can be made that the Company will be successful in achieving its plans.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of (1) PHI Group, Inc., its subsidiaries including (2) PHILUX Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF, a Luxembourg bank fund designed to hold a number of subfund compartments for investing in various selective industries, (3) PHI Luxembourg Development S.A., the mother holding company for PHILUX Global Funds, (4) PHI Luxembourg Holding S.A., (5) PHILUX Global General Partner S.A., (6) Asia Diamond Exchange, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), (7) PHILUX Capital Advisors, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (100%), and (8) CO2-1-0 (CARBON) Corp., collectively referred to as the Company. The other subsidiaries of the Company were not active during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents.\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES\nThe Companys securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes.\nEach investment in marketable securities typically represents less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock and stock equivalents of the investee, and each security is quoted on a national exchange or on the OTC Markets. As such, each investment is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320 (previously SFAS No. 115).\nUnrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in earnings based upon the adjusted cost of the specific security sold. On June 30, 2023 and 2022 the marketable securities have been recorded at $420 and $546, respectively, based upon the fair value of the marketable securities at that time.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nManagement reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts. There was no account receivable or bad debt during the fiscal ended June 30, 2023.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nEffective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted ASC 350 (Previously SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 350. ASC 350 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred; costs of major additions and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to ten years.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nThe cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are computed on a straight-line basis.\nNET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe Company adopted the provisions of ASC 260 (previously SFAS 128). ASC 260 eliminates the presentation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) and requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period and common stock equivalents outstanding at the end of the period.\nThe net earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted loss per share:\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss): $ (5,609,146 ) $ (21,154,443 )\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares outstanding: 34,455,935,655 28,448,615,941\nBasic net income per share (0.00 ) (0.00 )\nDiluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding: 34,455,935,655 28,448,615,941\nDiluted net income (loss) per share: $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 )\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nEffective July 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718-10-25 (previously SFAS 123R) and accordingly has adopted the modified prospective application method. Under this method, ASC 718-10-25 is applied to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards that are outstanding as of the date of adoption for which the requisite service has not been rendered (such as unvested options) is recognized over a period of time as the remaining requisite services are rendered.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair Value - Definition and Hierarchy\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether or not the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nA fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs are to be used when available.\nValuation techniques that are consistent with the market or income approach are used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nFair value is a market-based measure, based on assumptions of prices and inputs considered from the perspective of a market participant that are current as of the measurement date, rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Companys own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and are affected by a wide variety of factors, including; type of investment, whether the investment is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.\nTo the extent that valuation is based upon models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair Value - Valuation Techniques and Inputs\nThe Company holds and may invest public securities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC), private securities, real estate, convertible securities, interest bearing securities and other types of securities and has adopted specific techniques for their respective valuations.\nEquity Securities in Public Companies\nUnrestricted\nThe Company values investments in securities that are freely tradable and listed on major securities exchanges at their last reported sales price as of the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\nSecurities traded on inactive markets or valued by reference to similar instruments are generally categorized in Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nRestricted\nSecurities traded on public exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) where there are formal restrictions that limit (i.e. Rule 144 holding periods and underwriters lock-ups) their sale shall be valued at the closing price on the date of valuation less applicable discounts. The Company may apply a discount to securities with Rule 144 restrictions. Additional discounts may be assessed if the Company believes there are other mitigating factors which warrant the additional discounting. When determining potential additional discounts, factors that will be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to; securities trading characteristics, volume, length and overall impact of the restriction as well as other macro-economic factors. Valuations should be discounted appropriately until the securities may be freely traded.\nIf it has been determined that the exchange or OTC listed price does not accurately reflect fair market value, the Company may elect to treat the security as a private company and apply an alternative valuation method.\nInvestments in restricted securities of public companies may be included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. However, to the extent that significant inputs used to determine liquidity discounts are not observable, investments in restricted securities in public companies may be categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Companys financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-term notes payable, convertible notes, derivative liability and accounts payable.\nAs of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values as presented on the balance sheet. This is primarily attributed to the short maturities of these instruments.\nEffective July 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 (previously SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements and adopted this Statement for the assets and liabilities shown in the table below. ASC 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements. ASC 820 permits the Company to defer the recognition and measurement of the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until January 1, 2010. At June 30, 2023, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. ASC 820 requires that financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value be categorized as one of the types of investments based upon the methodology mentioned in Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 above for determining fair value.\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. The Company also has convertible notes and derivative liabilities as disclosed in this report that are measured at fair value on a regular basis until paid off or exercised.\nThe Company uses various approaches to measure fair value of available-for-sale securities, while applying the three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures, specified in ASC 820. Our Level 1 securities were measured using the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nThe companys policy regarding the transfers in and/or out of Level 3 depends on the trading activity of the security, the volatility of the security, and other observable units which clearly represents the fair value of the security. If a level 3 security can be measured using a more fairly represented fair value, we will transfer these securities either into Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the type of inputs.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARDS\nASC 606-10 provides the following overview of how revenue is recognized from an entitys contracts with customers: An entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price - The transaction price is the amount of consideration in a contract to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract - Any entity typically allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices of each distinct good or service promised in the contract.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation - An entity recognizes revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer (which is when the customer obtains control of that good or service).\nThe amount of revenue recognized is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time (typically for promises to transfer goods to a customer) or over time (typically for promises to transfer service to a customer). For performance obligations satisfied over time, an entity recognizes revenue over time by selecting an appropriate method for measuring the entitys progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. (Paragraphs 606-10 25-23 through 25-30).\nIn addition, ASC 606-10 contains guidance on the disclosures related to revenue, and notes the following:\nIt also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that would result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entitys contracts with customers. Specifically, Section 606-10-50 requires an entity to provide information about:\n- Revenue recognized from contracts with customers, including disaggregation of revenue into appropriate categories.\n- Contract balances, including the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities.\n- Performance obligations, including when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations and the transaction prices is that is allocated to the remaining performance obligations in a contract.\n- Significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the requirements to those contracts.\nAdditionally, Section 340-40-50 requires an entity to provide quantitative and/or qualitative information about assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.\nThe Companys revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC 606-10. The Company recognizes consulting and advisory fee revenues in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines and expenses are recognized in the period in which the corresponding liability is incurred.\nADVERTISING\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $500 and $8,700, respectively.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nASC 220-10-45 (previously SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income) establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity, except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No. 130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $(3,035,495) and $ ($572,591) are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 (previously SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes). Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nREPORTING OF SEGMENTS\nASC 280 (previously Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information), which supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise, establishes standards for the way that public enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements regarding products and services, geographic areas and major customers. ASC 280 defines operating segments as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company operated in one revenue-generating segment during the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The Company provides its service and receives marketable securities upon execution of transactions. Consequently, the value of the securities received from customers can be affected by economic fluctuations and each customers business growth. The actual realized value of these securities could be significantly different than recorded value.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.\nUpdate No. 2018-13 - August 2018\nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement\nModifications: The following disclosure requirements were modified in Topic 820:\n1. In lieu of a roll-forward for Level 3 fair value measurements, a nonpublic entity is required to disclose transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities.\n2. For investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investees assets and the date when restrictions from redemption might lapse only if the investee has communicated the timing to the entity or announced the timing publicly.\n3. The amendments clarify that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date.\nAdditions: The following disclosure requirements were added to Topic 820; however, the disclosures are not required for nonpublic entities:\n1. The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period.\n2. The range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.\nThe amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.\nUpdate No. 2018-07 - June 2018\nCompensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)\nImprovements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting\nMain Provisions: The amendments in this Update expand the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (that is, the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period). The amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantors own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year.\nUpdate No. 2017-13 - September 2017\nRevenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\nFASB Accounting Standards Updates No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), issued in May 2014 and codified in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and No. 2016-02.\nThe transition provisions in ASC Topic 606 require that a public business entity and certain other specified entities adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting 3 periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. FN2 All other entities are required to adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019.\nUpdate No. 2016-10 - April 2016\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\nThe core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:\n1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determine the transaction price.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas.\nThe Company has either evaluated or is currently evaluating the implications, if any, of each of these pronouncements and the possible impact they may have on the Companys financial statements. In most cases, management has determined that the implementation of these pronouncements would not have a material impact on the financial statements taken as a whole.\nNOTE 3 - OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nThe Companys marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and, as such, are carried at fair value. All of the securities are comprised of shares of common stock of the investee. Securities classified as available-for-sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and for other purposes. Each investment in marketable securities represents less than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding common stock and stock equivalents of the investee, and each security is nationally quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) or the OTC Markets. As such, each investment is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115.\nMarketable securities owned by the Company and classified as available for sale as of June 30, 2023 consisted of\nshares of Myson Group, Inc. traded on the OTC Markets (Trading symbols MYSN). The fair value of the marketable securities recorded as of June 30, 2023 was $420.42.\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES\nSecurities available for sale Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nJune 30, 2023 $ - $ 420 $ - $ 420\nJune 30, 2022 $ - $ 546 $ - $ 546\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, there was no transfer of securities from level 3 to level 2.\nNOTE 4 - OTHER ASSETS\nThe Other Assets comprise of the following as of June 30, 2023 and 2022\nSCHEDULE OF OTHER ASSETS\nInvestment in Philux Global Funds 32,604 31,161\nInvestment in AQuarius Power, Inc. - 5,000\nTotal Other Assets $ 32,604 $ 36,161\nInvestments as of June 30, 2023 consist of $32,604 in the initial General Partner, Limited and Ordinary Shares of Philux Global Funds SCA, SICAV-RAIF based on the exchange rate as of June 30, 2023.

The Company recorded these amounts as liabilities until these sub-funds are set up and capitalized, at which time the sub-fund participants will receive 49% of the general partners portion of ownership in the relevant sub-funds for a total contribution of $2,000,000 each. The Company recorded a total of $1,624,775 as of June 30, 2023 and $1,574,775 as of June 30, 2022 as sub-fund obligations.\nNOTE 7- DUE TO OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS\nDue to officer, represents loans and advances made by officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries, unsecured and due on demand.

These notes bear interest rates ranging from 0% to 36% per annum.\nCONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES:\nAs of June 30, 2023, the principal balance of the outstanding convertible notes was $297,805 with total derivative liabilities of $1,220,576. The Company relies on professional third-party valuation to record the value of derivative liabilities, discounts, and changes in fair value of derivatives in connection with these convertible notes and warrants, if any, that are related to the convertible notes.\nNOTE 9 - BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE\nNet loss per share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASIA DIAMOND EXCHANGE IN VIETNAM\nAlong with the establishment of Philux Global Funds, the Company has worked with the Authority of Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Central Vietnam and the Provinces of Quang Nam and Dong Nai, Vietnam, to develop the Asia Diamond Exchange for lab-grown, rough and polished diamond together with a multi-commodities logistics center.\nMr. Ben Smet, who successfully established the Dubai Diamond Exchange in 2002-2005, has been leading fulltime a group of experts for the setup of the Asian Diamond Exchange since January 2018. He has brought together the 11 main trading players in the rough diamond industry to come to Vietnam. He has established a partnership with the biggest player in the rough trading and polishing group, the Mehta Family Group. Other main international diamond trading groups as the Mody Group, Diamac etc. have joined the overall venture.\nFurthermore, together with the groups, a full Kimberly Process Certification Scheme (KPC) to prevent \u2018conflicting diamond trading was established and is aligned from time to time. Also, the new lab grown diamond KPC scheduling is already implemented. A unique and KPC approved structure has been established where under the PHI Vietnam umbrella, in collaboration with KPC Mum- bai (India), a \u2018Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) is established in which the Vietnamese authorities hold 15% and PHI (or its local corporate entity) holds 85% of the voting rights. For the lab grown diamond segment, this will be in the Chu Lai Free Economic Zone and for the Rough and Polished Diamond Parcel Trade, this is being planned to be on Thanh Da Island, about 5 kilometers from the center of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\nThe Company has taken the decision to move the greater part of the ADE rough and polishing venture, first to an Industrial Zone to be established close to the new international Airport in Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam and this year to the Thanh Da Island. This location change has caused that the entire KPC Process and administration had to be adapted and redone with renewed financial input, mostly carried by Mr. Smet.\nA rough diamond trading export flow to Vietnam was negotiated and concluded by Mr. Smet with the DMCC and Dubai Diamond Exchange. This year, an international diamond trading platform was created by Mr. Smet to unify the trading efforts of Alrosa and De Beers/Bonas. Mr. Smet was advised and counselled thereto by Mr. A. Mehta, the senior board member of the Alrosa Group. Together with Mr. A. Mehta, Mr. Smet has also covered the financial backbone of the diamond trading venture via the setup of a financial institution in Botswana. It is the intention of Mr. Smet to donate 50% of his own voting shares of the institution to PHI the moment all budgets for the venture are arranged by PHI and all financial obligations and reimbursements by PHI to him are met. It is the intention of the parties involved to establish a subsidiary of the financial institution in the ADE Vietnam and have local banking partners join this initiative.\nMr. Smet had also established a collaboration partnership with the Antwerp Diamond Exchange (Belgium), the Dubai Diamond Exchange and the Tel-Aviv Diamond Exchange. Negotiations have started to involve a new economic free-zone in Jordan into the ongoing project.\nRecently, Mr. Smet has started a structuring project, in order for PHI to set up and establish an International Financial Center on the Thanh Da Island in connection with the Asian Diamond Exchange. This will be similar as what Mr. Smet has established successfully for Dubai in 2002-2005 and this now incorporating the international changes of the last decade.\nOnce the Company has effectuated all budgeting and all financial requirements and obligations, the ongoing process will effectively materialize and Mr. Smet then shall transfer the entire venture to Philux Global Group, Inc.\nOn June 04, 2022 the Company incorporated Asia Diamond Exchange, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, ID number 2022-001010234, as the holding company for this venture.\n6.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant GHG, accounting for the majority of emissions. The main sectors contributing to GHG emissions are energy production, transportation, industry, agriculture, and land use change. Emerging economies, such as China and India, have witnessed significant increases in emissions due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Rising GHG emissions lead to the greenhouse effect, causing global warming and climate change. This phenomenon contributes to various environmental and socio-economic challenges, including extreme weather events, sea-level rise, disrupted ecosystems, and threats to human health and food security.\nSSE Groups proprietary technologies are a self-sustaining energy system created by absolute interactions with the air condition of the atmosphere. Test results have shown that this system can enhance and extend the burning time of traditional fuels such as gasoline, diesel and coal by 50% or more and eliminate toxic emissions surpassing Euro6 standards of harmful exhaust. It also cleans the carbon in the internal combustion engine and stabilizes the burning temperature of the engine chamber for optimal performance. For use in vehicles, the installation is fast and inexpensive and does not require any additional power supply or batteries. SSE Global Group intends to launch products for internal combustion engines and fossil fuel power plants to save input fuels and eliminate toxic emissions.\n20.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation, our management (including our Chief Executive Officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023, based on the material weaknesses defined below.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control of Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a set of processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys principal executive and principal financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets,\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of authorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Companys management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.\nThe material weaknesses related to a lack of a full segregation of duties and to our lack of sufficient personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions with sufficient experience and expertise with respect to the application of U.S. GAAP and related financial reporting.\nBased on this assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023.\nManagements Remediation Plan\nWe plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the future:\n(i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and\n(ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.\nThe remediation efforts set out in (i) are largely dependent upon our company securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.\nManagement believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Rule 308(b) of Regulation S-K, which permits the Company to provide only managements report in this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting have come to managements attention during the Companys last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
