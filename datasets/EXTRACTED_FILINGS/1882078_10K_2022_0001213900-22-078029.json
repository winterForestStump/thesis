    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nWe are a blank check company incorporated on July 21, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry, we intend to search globally, with a focus on target companies within the healthcare industry.\nThe Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on November 17, 2021 (the Initial Public Offering, or IPO). On November 22, 2021, we consummated its Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the Units) at $10.00 per Unit Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (the Common Stock), one right to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of a share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase three-fourths (3/4) of a share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. The Company incurred offering costs of $5,587,733, of which $2,587,500 was for deferred underwriting commissions. On November 22, 2021, the over-allotment option was exercised in full.\nOn November 22, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the Private Placement) of 193,889 units and 60,000 units, respectively (the Private Units) to Arisz Investments LLC, the Companys sponsor (the Sponsor) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, generating total proceeds of $2,538,886.\nAlso, on November 22, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units (the Over-Allotment Option Units) occurred on November 24, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 900,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $9,000,000. On November 24, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 13,500 Private Units and 9,000 Private Units to the sponsor and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, respectively, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.\nA total of $69,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placements on November 22, 2021 and November 24, 2021, were placed in a trust account (the Trust Account), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of common stock and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares, each holder will receive an amount equal to (1) the number of public shares being converted by such public holder divided by the total number of public shares multiplied by (2) the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share), which includes the deferred underwriting commission, plus a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes (subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors).\nMerger Agreement\nOn January 21, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement with Finfront Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the BitFuFu), pursuant to which (a) Arisz agreed to form BitFuFu Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Purchaser or PubCo), (b) Purchaser would form Boundary Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub), (c) Arisz will be merged with and into Purchaser (the Redomestication Merger), with Purchaser surviving the Redomestication Merger, and (d) Merger Sub will be merged with and into BitFuFu (the Acquisition Merger), with BitFuFu surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the Business Combination).

Of each such installment, the sum of Six Hundred Ninety Thousand Dollars ($690,000) (the Extension Funding Amount) shall be used to cover the extension costs, and the remaining Fifty Thousand ($50,000) shall be used for working capital. In the event that the actual extension costs are less than the Extension Funding Amount, Arisz shall promptly repay the difference between such actual extension costs and the Extension Funding Amount. Arisz shall issue a promissory note for the amount of the Loan in favor of the Company;\n(4) that the Outside Date is extended to August 1, 2023;\n(5) that the Merger Agreement may be terminated (a) by the Parent Parties, in the event that BitFuFu fails to fund any of the installment amounts of the Loan specified in Section 9.8 of the Merger Agreement by the applicable due dates, (h) by the Parent Parties or BitFuFu, in the event that the Parent Parties fail to obtain any extension to the termination date by which time Arisz must cease operations unless a business combination has been consummated and (i) by BitFuFu, in the event that Arisz defaults on the Promissory Note as specified in such Section 9.8, which default remains not cured within ten (10) calendar days; and\n(6) for (i) a Parent breakup fee payable by BitFuFu to Arisz equal to Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) in cash in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement by Arisz pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Merger Agreement or as a result of BitFuFus refusal to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) a Company breakup fee payable by Arisz to BitFuFu in the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement by BitFuFu pursuant to Section 11.1(c) of the Merger Agreement or as a result of Ariszs refusal to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz issued a promissory note for the amount of the Loan in favor of BitFuFu (the Promissory Note), pursuant to which Arisz may elect to issue a number of unregistered shares of its common stock, valued for these purposes at $10.00 per share, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loan, to BitFuFu or its designee as payment of its obligations under the Loan, except in the event that the actual extension costs are less than the Extension Funding Amount, Arisz shall wire such prepayment to such account as designated by BitFuFu.\nBackstop Agreements\nOn July 14, 2022, each of Arisz , BitFuFu, the Purchaser and the Sponsor (and, along with any assignee of the Sponsor, the Buyer) entered into a backstop agreement (the Backstop Agreement) whereby, in connection with the Business Combination, the Buyer has agreed to subscribe for and purchase no less than US$1.25 million worth of shares of Arisz common stock par value $0.0001 per share or Purchasers Class A ordinary shares, as specified therein.

No member of our management team has had management experience with special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. You should not rely on the historical record of our management teams or advisors or their respective affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance.\nCompetition\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.\nEmployees\nWe currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.\nFor additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4 filed with the SEC on November 17, 2021.

PROPERTIES\nOur executive offices are located at 199 Water St, 31st Floor, New York, NY 10038, and our telephone number is 212-845-9945.\nCommencing on the date our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have agreed to pay Arisz Investments LLC, our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. ITEM 3.

The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 21, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination.\nOn January 21, 2022, Arisz entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Merger Agreement), by and between Arisz and Finfront Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company (BitFuFu), pursuant to which (a) Arisz will form BitFuFu Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Purchaser), (b) Purchaser will form Boundary Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub), (c) Arisz will be merged with and into Purchaser (the Redomestication Merger), with Purchaser surviving the Redomestication Merger, and (d) Merger Sub will be merged with and into BitFuFu (the Acquisition Merger), with BitFuFu surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the Business Combination). Following the Business Combination, Purchaser will be a publicly traded company listed on a stock exchange in the United States. On April 4, 2022, each of Arisz and the Company entered into that certain Amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the parties clarified certain Cayman Island corporate law matters by mutual agreement.\nIn consideration of the Acquisition Merger, Purchaser will issue 150,000,000 ordinary shares (the Closing Payment Shares) with a deemed price per share US$10.00 (Aggregate Stock Consideration) to the shareholders of BitFuFu. The Aggregate Stock Consideration consists of 7,500,000 Class A ordinary shares and 142,500,000 Class B ordinary shares of Purchaser.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Business Combination shall occur no later than July 31, 2022 (the Outside Date) and that the Outside Date may be extended upon the written agreement of Arisz and BitFuFu.\nOn July 14, 2022, each of Arisz, BitFuFu, the Purchaser and Ariszs Sponsor (along with any assignee of Ariszs Sponsor, the Buyer) entered into a backstop agreement (the Backstop Agreement) whereby, in connection with the Business Combination, the Buyer has agreed to subscribe for and purchase no less than US$1.25 million worth of shares of Arisz common stock par value $0.0001 per share or Purchasers Class A ordinary shares.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz and BitFuFu entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things: 1) for a loan from BitFuFu to Arisz in the amount of $2,220,000 (the Loan) for the purpose of funding Ariszs extension of the time to consummate a business combination and for working capital purposes, and 2) remove all existing restrictions on 400,000 Insider Shares that are currently subject to transfer restrictions, so that such shares are freely tradeable upon the Closing. The Loan will be funded in three equal installments of $740,000 on each of October 26, 2022, January 26, 2023 and April 26, 2023.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz issued an unsecured promissory note to BitFuFu for the amount of the Loan at an interest rate of 3.5% per annum and is due on October 26, 2023. Arisz may elect to issue a number of unregistered shares of its common stock, valued for these purposes at $10.00 per share, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loan.\nOn October 13, 2022, the parties to the Backstop Agreement entered into a new backstop agreement substantially on the same terms as the Backstop Agreement with the only substantive additional terms being that: 1) the subscription amount is $2.0 million worth of shares and 2) the termination date is the earlier of: (i) the date agreed by the parties thereto in writing and (ii) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated, on its terms.\nOn October 24, 2022, Arisz received $740,000, the first installment of the Loan, from BitFuFu.\nOn November 9, 2022, Arisz deposited $690,000 into the Trust Account (representing $0.10 per each share of redeemable common stock) to extend the time for Arisz to complete the Business Combination by three months until February 17, 2023.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete the Business Combination will be successful.\nResults of Operations\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through September 30, 2022 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for our initial public offering (IPO), and, after our IPO, searching for a target business to acquire. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the IPO. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we had a net loss of $359,608, which consists of loss of approximately $597,351 derived from general and administrative expenses of approximately $544,157, franchise tax expense of $53,194 and income tax expense of $49,057, offset by interest earned on marketable securities of approximately $286,800.\nFor the period from July 21, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021, we had a net loss of $490, all of which derived from general and administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nOn November 22, 2021 the Company consummated the IPO of 6,000,000 units (which does not include the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in the IPO) at an offering price of $10.00 per unit (the Public Units), generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor and Chardan Capital Markets LLC (Chardan) (and/or their designees) 253,889 units at $10.00 per unit (the Private Units) in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of $2,538,886. Concurrently, the Company repaid $105,000 to the Sponsor, under related party loan evidenced by promissory note issued on August 5, 2021.\nOn November 24, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised its over-allotment option and purchased 900,000 units (the Over-allotment Units) at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $9,000,000. Upon the closing of the Over-allotment on November 24, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 22,500 Private Units (the Additional Private Units) with the Sponsor and Chardan at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $225,000.\nA total of $69,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Public Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the Private Placements on November 22, 2021 and November 24, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Companys public shareholders.\nFollowing the IPO, the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Placement Units, we had $655,286 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the IPO, available for working capital purposes. We incurred a total of $5,587,733 in transaction costs, including $1,725,000 of underwriting fees, $2,587,500 of deferred underwriting fees and $1,275,233 of other offering costs. For the year ended September 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $484,814 and none for the period from July 21, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $69,286,800 consisting of securities held in a treasury trust fund that invests in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through September 30, 2022, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Account to pay our taxes. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a Business Combination, the remaining funds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash of $173,789 outside of the Trust Account and working capital of $87,562 (excluding income tax and franchise tax payable). The Company has 15 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination (unless further extended as described herein). It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\nUntil consummation of the Business Combination, we intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to acquire and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. In this event, our officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate an initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us upon consummation of the Business Combination. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. The terms of such loans by our initial shareholders, officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. In connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Companys board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Companys plans to consummate a Business Combination (within 15 months from the closing of IPO) will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such additional condition also raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\nContractual Obligations\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than described below.\nUpon closing of a Business Combination, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of $0.375 per public share, or $2,587,500 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriters will also be entitled to 51,750 common shares, to be issued if the Company closes a Business Combination.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:\nCommon stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nWe account for our common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The Companys common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of the Companys balance sheet. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of shares of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. The statements of operations include a presentation of income (loss) per redeemable share and income (loss) per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of income per share. In order to determine the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the Company first considered the undistributed income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares and the undistributed income (loss) is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. The Company then allocated the undistributed income (loss) ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the common shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public shareholders.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Companys control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.\nOffering Costs\nOffering costs consist of underwriting, legal, accounting, registration and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the IPO. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A - Expenses of Offering. Offering costs are allocated between public shares and public rights based on the estimated fair values of public shares and public rights at the date of issuance.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entitys own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThis information appears following Item 15 of this Report and is included herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nMerger Agreement\nOn January 21, 2022, we entered into a merger agreement with Finfront Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the BitFuFu), pursuant to which (a) Arisz agreed to form BitFuFu Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Purchaser or PubCo), (b) Purchaser would form Boundary Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub), (c) Arisz will be merged with and into Purchaser (the Redomestication Merger), with Purchaser surviving the Redomestication Merger, and (d) Merger Sub will be merged with and into BitFuFu (the Acquisition Merger), with BitFuFu surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the Business Combination).

Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class serving a three-year term. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Romain Guerel, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Nick He and Rushi Trivedi, will expire at the second annual meeting. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Echo Hindle-Yang and Marc Estigarribia, will expire at our third annual meeting of stockholders. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate our initial business combination.\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our directors may consist of a chairman of the board, and that our officer may consist of chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, executive vice president(s), vice president(s), secretary, treasurer and such other officers as may be determined by the board of directors.\nExecutive Compensation\nNo executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on the date of our IPO prospectus through the completion of our initial business combination with a target business, we will pay to Arisz Investment LLC, a fee of $10,000 per month for providing us with office space and certain office and secretarial services. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, our sponsor agreed to defer the payment of such monthly fee. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. Other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finders fees, consulting fees and other similar fees, will be paid to our insiders or any of the members of our management team, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and the interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K, as required by the SEC.\nDirector independence\nNasdaq listing standards require that within one year of the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Global Market we have at least three independent directors and that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the companys board of directors, would interfere with the directors exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board of Directors had determined that each of Rushi Trivedi, Romain Guerel and Nick He is an independent director as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\nWe will only enter into a business combination if it is approved by a majority of our independent directors. Additionally, we will only enter into transactions with our officers and directors and their respective affiliates that are on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from independent parties. Any related-party transactions must be approved by our audit committee and a majority of disinterested directors.\nAudit Committee\nEffective as of the date of our IPO prospectus, we established an audit committee of the board of directors, which consists of Rushi Trivedi, Romain Guerel and Nick He, each of whom is an independent director. Nick He serves as chairman of the audit committee.\nThe audit committees duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf reviewing and discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the annual audited financial statements, and recommending to the board whether the audited financial statements should be included in our Form 10-K;\n\u25cf discussing with management and the independent registered public accounting firm significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of our financial statements;\n\u25cf discussing with management major risk assessment and risk management policies;\n\u25cf monitoring the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n\u25cf verifying the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit as required by law;\n\u25cf reviewing and approving all related-party transactions;\n\u25cf inquiring and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u25cf pre-approving all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed;\n\u25cf appointing or replacing the independent registered public accounting firm;\n\u25cf determining the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work;\n\u25cf establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and\n\u25cf approving reimbursement of expenses incurred by our management team in identifying potential target businesses.\nFinancial Experts on Audit Committee\nThe audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of independent directors who are financially literate as defined under the Nasdaq listing standards. The Nasdaq listing standards define financially literate as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a companys balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.\nIn addition, we must certify to Nasdaq that the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individuals financial sophistication. The board of directors has determined that Nick He qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCompensation Committee\nEffective as of the date of our IPO prospectus, we established a compensation committee of the board of directors consisting of Rushi Trivedi, Romain Guerel and Nick He, each of whom is an independent director. Rushi Trivedi serves as chairman of the compensation committee.\nWe adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:\n\u25cf reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officers based on such evaluation;\n\u25cf reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers and reviewing and making recommendations with respect to all non-executive officer compensation;\n\u25cf reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;\n\u25cf implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;\n\u25cf assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;\n\u25cf approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees;\n\u25cf producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and\n\u25cf reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.\nThe charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.\nDirector nominations\nWe do not have a standing nominating committee, though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. Rushi Trivedi, Romain Guerel and Nick He will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(1)(A) of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.\nThe board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to the Board should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders\nDirector Compensation\nNo director will receive cash compensation for serving on our board. Prior to the closing of the offering, the sponsor transferred an aggregate of 57,500 insider shares to the directors.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nWe may not have a compensation committee in place prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Any executive compensation matters that arise prior to the time we have a compensation committee in place will be determined by our independent directors. None of our directors who currently serve as members of our compensation committee is, or has at any time in the past been, one of our officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our compensation committee.\nCode of ethics\nEffective upon consummation of our IPO, we adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors and employees. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.\nConflicts of interest\nInvestors should be aware of the following potential conflicts of interest:\n\u25cf None of our officers and directors is required to commit their full time to our affairs and, accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities.\n\u25cf In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to our company as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Thus, our officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\n\u25cf Our officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities, including other blank check companies, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by our company.\n\u25cf Unless we consummate our initial business combination, our officers, directors and other insiders will not receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them to the extent that such expenses exceed the amount of available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.\n\u25cf The insider shares beneficially owned by our officers and directors will be released from escrow only if our initial business combination is successfully completed. Additionally, if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time frame, our officers and directors will not be entitled to receive any amounts held in the trust account with respect to any of their insider shares or private units. Furthermore, Arisz Investment LLC has agreed that the private units will not be sold or transferred by it until after we have completed our initial business combination. For the foregoing reasons, our board may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effect our initial business combination.\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:\n\u25cf the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;\n\u25cf the opportunity is within the corporations line of business; and\n\u25cf it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.\nAccordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of corporate opportunity will not apply with respect to any of our officers or directors in circumstances where the application of the doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple affiliations, our officers and directors (other than our independent directors) have agreed to present to us for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other person or entity, any suitable opportunity to acquire a target business, until the earlier of: (1) our consummation of an initial business combination and (2) 15 months (or up to 18 months if our time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) from the date of our IPO prospectus. This agreement is, however, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations such officer or director may from time to time have to another entity. Accordingly, if any of them becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers and directors will materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination because in most cases the affiliated companies are closely held entities controlled by the officer or director or the nature of the affiliated companys business is such that it is unlikely that a conflict will arise.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our shares of common stock and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons.\nBased solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment.\nExecutive Officers and Director Compensation\nOther than the $10,000 per month administrative fee paid to the Arisz Investments LLC, our Sponsor, over which Echo Hindle-Yang is the managing member, no executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including any finders fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our Sponsor, officers or directors, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of our officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more officers serving on our board of directors. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe following table sets forth as of December 6, 2022 the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by (i) each person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (ii) each of our officers and directors; and (iii) all of our officers and directors as a group.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nFounder Shares\nOn August 5, 2021, our Sponsor purchased 1,437,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On October 29, 2021, we effected a 1.2-for-1.0 stock split of our common stock, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 1,725,000 insider shares. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent approximately 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of our IPO (excluding the shares of common stock issued to the representative or its designees, the placement units and securities underlying the placement units and assuming the initial stockholders do not purchase units in the IPO). As of September 30, 2022, the Sponsor owned 1,943,889 shares of common stock. As the underwriters over-allotment option has been exercised in full, none of the shares of Common Stock held by the Sponsor are subject to forfeiture.\nThe initial stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares (or shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof) until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of the initial Business Combination and (B) subsequent to the initial Business Combination, if the reported last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the initial Business Combination.\nPromissory Note - Related Party\nOn August 5, 2021, the Sponsor issued to us an unsecured promissory note, pursuant to which we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. The note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or the date on which we determine not to proceed with the Initial Public Offering.. Concurrently with the IPO, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of $105,000 to the Sponsor.\nRelated Party Loans\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into additional Placement Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2022, there was no amount outstanding under any Working Capital Loan.\nAdministrative Services Arrangement\nOur financial advisor has agreed, commencing from the date that our securities are first listed on NASDAQ through the earlier of our consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to make available to us certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative services, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay the Sponsor $10,000 per month for these services.\nGeneral\nOur Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.\nOther than the payment to our Sponsor of $10,000 per month, for up to 15 months (or up to 18 months if extended), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination.\nRelated Party Policy\nOur Code of Ethics, which we adopted on November 17, 2021, requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.\nIn addition, our audit committee, pursuant to a written charter that we adopted on November 17, 2021, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter into such transactions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. A form of the audit committee charter that we adopted on November 17, 2021, is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which our IPO prospectus is a part. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.\nThese procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our Sponsor, officers or directors unless we, or a committee of independent directors, have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, no finders fees, reimbursements, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our Sponsor, officers or directors prior to, for services rendered to us prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, the following payments will be made to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, none of which will be made from the proceeds of our public offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:\n\u25cf Repayment of up to an aggregate of $300,000 in loans made to us by our Sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;\n\u25cf Payment to our financial advisor of $10,000 per month, for up to 15 months (or 18 months if the time to complete a business is extended), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support;\n\u25cf Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination; and\n\u25cf Repayment of non-interest bearing loans which may be made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the terms of which (other than as described above) have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units.\nOur audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.\nDirector Independence\nNasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. For a description of the director independence, see - Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.\nThe following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Friedman, LLP, or Friedman, for services rendered.\nAudit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Friedman in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of Friedman for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 8-K for the respective periods and other required filings with the SEC for the period from July 21, 2021 (date of inception) to September 30, 2021 totaled approximately $0.00 and $85,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings.\nAudit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the period from July 21, 2021 to September 30, 2021 and for the year ended September 30, 2022, we did not pay Friedman any audit-related fees.\nTax Fees. We did not pay Friedman for tax return services, planning and tax advice for the period July 21, 2021 to September 30, 2021 and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAll Other Fees. We did not pay Friedman for any other services for the period from July 21, 2021 to September 30, 2021 and for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nPre-Approval Policy\nOur audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).\npart IV ITEM 15.

As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Organization and Business Operation\nArisz Acquisition Corp. (Arisz or the Company) is a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on July 21, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (Business Combination). The Company has selected September 30 as its fiscal year end.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activities through September 30, 2022 have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial Public Offering (IPO as defined below in Note 3). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the IPO.\nThe Companys sponsor is Arisz Investments LLC (the Sponsor), a Delaware limited liability company affiliated with the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nOn January 21, 2022, Arisz entered into a merger agreement with Finfront Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the BitFuFu), pursuant to which (a) Arisz agreed to form BitFuFu Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Purchaser or PubCo), (b) Purchaser would form Boundary Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub), (c) Arisz will be merged with and into Purchaser (the Redomestication Merger), with Purchaser surviving the Redomestication Merger, and (d) Merger Sub will be merged with and into BitFuFu (the Acquisition Merger), with the Company surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the Business Combination). Following the Business Combination, Purchaser will be a publicly traded company listed on a stock exchange in the United States. On April 4, 2022, each of Arisz and BitFuFu entered into that certain Amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the parties clarified certain Cayman Island corporate law matters by mutual agreement.\nOn July 14, 2022, each of Arisz , BitFuFu, the Purchaser and Ariszs Sponsor (along with any assignee of Ariszs Sponsor, the Buyer) entered into a backstop agreement (the Backstop Agreement) whereby, in connection with the Business Combination, the Buyer has agreed to subscribe for and purchase no less than US$1.25 million worth of shares of Arisz common stock par value $0.0001 per share or Purchasers Class A ordinary shares.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz and BitFuFu entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things: 1) for a loan from BitFuFu to Arisz in the amount of $2,220,000 (the Loan) for the purpose of funding Ariszs extension of the time to consummate a business combination and for working capital purposes, and 2) remove all existing restrictions on 400,000 Insider Shares that are currently subject to transfer restrictions, so that such shares are freely tradeable upon the Closing. The Loan will be funded in three equal installments of $740,000 on each of October 26, 2022, January 26, 2023 and April 26, 2023, and 3) extend the Outside Date to August 1, 2023.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz issued an unsecured promissory note to BitFuFu for the amount of the Loan at an interest rate of 3.5% per annum and is due on October 26, 2023. Arisz may elect to issue a number of unregistered shares of its common stock, valued for these purposes at $10.00 per share, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loan.\nOn October 13, 2022, the parties to the Backstop Agreement entered into a new backstop agreement substantially on the same terms as the Backstop Agreement with the only substantive additional terms being that: 1) the subscription amount is $2.0 million worth of shares and 2) the termination date is the earlier of: (i) the date agreed by the parties thereto in writing and (ii) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated, on its terms.\nFinancing\nThe registration statement for the Companys IPO became effective on November 17, 2021. On November 22, 2021 the Company consummated the IPO of 6,000,000 units (which does not include the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in the IPO) at an offering price of $10.00 per unit (the Public Units), generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company sold to its Sponsor and Chardan Capital Markets LLC (Chardan) (and/or their designees) 253,889 units at $10.00 per unit (the Private Units) in a private placement generating total gross proceeds of $2,538,886, which is described in Note 4.\nConcurrently, the Company repaid $105,000 to the Sponsor, under related party loan evidenced by promissory note issued on August 5, 2021.\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On November 24, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 900,000 units (the Over-allotment Units) at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $9,000,000. Upon the closing of the Over-allotment on November 24, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 22,500 Private Units (the Additional Private Units) with the Sponsor and Chardan at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $225,000.\nTransaction costs amounted to $5,587,733, consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees, $2,587,500 of deferred underwriting fees (payable only upon completion of a Business Combination) and $1,275,233 of other offering costs.\nTrust Account\nUpon closing of the IPO, the Private Units, the sale of the Over-allotment Units and the sale of the Additional Private Units, a total of $69,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the Trust Account) with Continental Stock Transfer& Trust acting as trustee and can be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. These funds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination and the liquidation due to the Companys failure to complete a Business Combination within the applicable period of time. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Companys creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Companys public stockholders. In addition, interest income earned on the funds in the Trust account may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations. With these exceptions, expenses incurred by the Company may be paid prior to a business combination only from the net proceeds of the IPO and private placement not held in the Trust Account.\nBusiness Combination\nPursuant to NASDAQ listing rules, the Companys initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the Trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust account), which the Company refers to as the 80% test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for its initial business combination, although the Company may structure a business combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. If the Company is no longer listed on NASDAQ, it will not be required to satisfy the 80% test.\nThe Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Companys Sponsor and any of the Companys officers or directors that may hold Insider Shares (as defined in Note 5) (the Initial Stockholders) and Chardan have agreed (a) to vote their Insider Shares, Private Shares (as defined in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any shares (including the Insider Shares) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve, or sell the shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with, a proposed Business Combination.\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income tax obligations). If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.\nThe Initial Stockholders and Chardan have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Insider Shares, Private Shares, Underwriter Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.\nThe Company will have until 15 months (or up to 18 months if the time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination. In addition, if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate initial business combination within 15 months, the Companys insiders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of 18 months to complete a business combination) (the Combination Period).\nLiquidation\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less certain amount of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe Sponsor and Chardan have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Insider Shares and Private Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or underwriters acquires Public Shares in or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than $10.00.\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below $10.00 per Public Share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Companys indemnity of the underwriters of IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nAs of September 30, 2022, cash of $173,789 and a working capital of $87,562 (excluding income tax and franchise tax payable). The Company has 15 months (or up to 18 months if the time to complete a business combination is extended as described herein) from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\nThe Company expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and to incur significant transaction costs in pursuit of the consummation of a Business Combination. The Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete its Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account.\nOn November 9, 2022, the Company deposited $690,000 into the Trust Account (representing $0.10 per each share of redeemable common stock) to extend the time for Arisz to complete the Business Combination by three months until February 17, 2023. It is uncertain that the Company will be able consummate a Business Combination by this date. If a Business Combination is not consummated by the required date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 15 months from the closing of the IPO, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Companys future financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, there has not been a significant impact as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the future outcome of this uncertainty.\nAdditionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Companys ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Companys ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022.\nAny redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Companys ability to complete a Business Combination.\nAt this time, it has been determined that none of the IR Act tax provisions have an impact to the Companys fiscal 2022 tax provision. The Company will continue to monitor for updates to the Companys business along with guidance issued with respect to the IR Act to determine whether any adjustments are needed to the Companys tax provision in future periods.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying audited financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, they include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal accruals) considered for a fair presentation have been included.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, the Companys management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $173,789 and $75,000 in cash as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The Company did not have any cash equivalents for both fiscal years.\nInvestments held in Trust Account\nAt September 30, 2022, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities.\nThe Company classifies its U.S. Treasury and equivalent securities as held-to-maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320 Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held-to- maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying balance sheet and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts.\nOffering Costs\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A - Expenses of Offering. Offering costs $5,587,733 consisting primarily of underwriting, legal, accounting, registration and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the IPO and charged to shareholders equity upon the completion of the IPO.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Companys control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.\nCommon Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The Companys common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2022, shares of common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value of $10.04 per share as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Companys balance sheet. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of shares of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution and money market funds held in the Trust Account. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. The statements of operations include a presentation of income (loss) per redeemable share and income (loss) per non-redeemable share following the two-class method of income per share. In order to determine the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, the Company first considered the undistributed income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares and the undistributed income (loss) is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. The Company then allocated the undistributed income (loss) ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable shares. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the common shares subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public shareholders. As of September 30, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\nThe net income (loss) per share presented in the statements of operations is based on the following:\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30,\nFor the period from\nJuly 21,\n2021 (inception)\nto September 30,\nNet Loss $ (359,608 ) $ (490 )\nAccretion of common stock to redemption value (14,432,564 ) -\nNet loss including accretion of common stock to redemption value $ (14,792,172 ) $ (490 )\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30,\nRedeemable\nshares Non-\nredeemable\nshares\nBasic and diluted net income/(loss) per share:\nNumerators:\nAllocation of net loss including accretion of common stock $ (11,098,722 ) $ (3,693,450 )\nAccretion of common stock to redemption value 14,145,764 -\nAllocation of net income (loss) $ 3,333,842 $ (3,693,450 )\nDenominators:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding 5,893,151 1,961,132\nBasic and diluted net income/(loss) per share $ 0.57 $ (1.88 )\nFor the period from July 21,\n2021 (inception)\nto September 30,\nRedeemable\nshares Non-\nredeemable\nshares\nBasic and diluted net income/(loss) per share:\nNumerators:\nAllocation of net loss including accretion of common stock $ -\n$ (490 )\nAccretion of common stock to redemption value -\n-\nAllocation of net income (loss) $ -\n$ (490 )\nDenominators:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding -\n1,500,000\nBasic and diluted net income/(loss) per share $ -\n$ (0.00 )\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nThe Company has identified the United States and the State of New York as its only major tax jurisdictions.\nThe Company may be subject to potential examination by federal and state taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Companys management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entitys own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nNote 3 - Initial Public Offering\nPursuant to the IPO on November 22, 2021, the Company sold 6,000,000 Units at $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On November 24, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 900,000 units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $9,000,000. Each Public Unit consists of one share of common stock (Public Share), one right (Public Right) and one redeemable warrant (Public Warrant). Each Public Right will convert into one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of a Business Combination. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase three-fourths (3/4) of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Companys initial Business Combination or 15 months from the closing of the IPO, and will expire five years after the completion of the Companys initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nAll of the 6,900,000 Public Shares sold as part of the Public Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or in connection with the Companys liquidation. In accordance with the SEC and its staffs guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity.\nThe Companys redeemable common stock is subject to SEC and its staffs guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).\nAs of September 30, 2022, the shares of common stock reflected on the balance sheets are reconciled in the following table.\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\nGross proceeds $ 69,000,000\nLess:\nProceeds allocated to Public Warrants (6,658,288 )\nProceeds allocated to Public Rights (2,726,727 )\nOffering costs of Public Shares (4,760,749 )\nPlus:\nAccretion of carrying value to redemption value 14,432,564\nClass A Common stock subject to possible redemption $ 69,286,800\nNote 4 - Private Placement\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Sponsor and Chardan (and/or their designees) purchased an aggregate of 253,889 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit for an aggregate purchase price of $2,538,886 in a private placement. Upon the closing of the Over-allotment on November 24, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 22,500 Private Units with the Sponsor and Chardan at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $225,000. The Private Units are identical to the Public Units except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions. The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Units and all underlying securities will expire worthless.\nNote 5 - Related Party Transactions\nInsider Shares\nOn August 5, 2021, the Company issued 1,437,500 shares of common stock to the Initial Stockholders (the Insider Shares) for an aggregated consideration of $25,000. On October 29, 2021, the Company effected a 1.2-for-1.0 stock split of common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 1,725,000 Insider Shares, for approximately $0.014 per share, of which, up to 225,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Initial Stockholders to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment is not exercised in full, so that the Initial Stockholders will collectively own 20% of the Companys issued and outstanding shares after the IPO. As the over-allotment option was fully exercised on November 24, 2021, no portion of the Insider Shares are subject to forfeiture.\nThe Initial Stockholders have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Insider Shares until, with respect to 50% of the Insider Shares, the earlier of six months after the consummation of a Business Combination and the date on which the closing price of the common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination and, with respect to the remaining 50% of the Insider Shares, until the six months after the consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Companys stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nPromissory Note - Related Party\nOn August 5, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate amount of $300,000 to be used, in part, for transaction costs incurred in connection with the IPO (the Promissory Note). The Promissory Note is unsecured, interest-free and due on the earlier of March 31, 2022 or the closing the IPO. Concurrently with the IPO, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of $105,000 to the Sponsor.\nAdministrative Services Agreement\nThe Company entered into an administrative services agreement with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Company pays a total of $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of the initial Business Combination or liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, the Sponsor agreed to defer the payment of such monthly fee. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination. For the year ended September 30, 2022 and the period from July 21 (inception) to September 30, 2021, the Company incurred $100,000 and none, respectively, in fees for these services, of which $100,000 and none are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nNote 6 - Commitments and Contingencies Risks and Uncertainties\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Companys future financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, there has not been a significant impact as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the future outcome of this uncertainty.\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the insider shares, the private units, securities underlying the Unit Purchase Option and any units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans or extension loans (and any securities underlying the private units or units issued upon conversion of the working capital loans or extension loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed prior to or on the effective date of IPO requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial business combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nRight of First Refusal\nThe Company has granted Chardan for a period of 24 months after the date of the consummation of the Companys Business Combination, a right of first refusal to act as book-running manager, with at least 30% of the economics, for any and all future public and private equity and debt offerings.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe Company has granted Chardan, the representative of the underwriters, a 45-day option from the date of this prospectus to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nThe underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.5% of the gross proceeds of the IPO (including the exercise of the over-allotment option), or $1,725,000. In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of 3.75% of the gross proceeds of the IPO (including the exercise of the over-allotment option), or $2,587,500, which will be paid upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriters will also be entitled to 0.75% of the gross proceeds of the IPO in the form of common stock of the Company at a price of $10.00 per share, to be issued if the Company closes a Business Combination.\nUnit Purchase Option\nThe Company sold to Chardan (and/or its designees), for $100, an option (the Unit Purchase Option) to purchase 115,000 units (as the over-allotment option was fully exercised on November 24, 2021) exercisable at $11.50 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $1,322,500) commencing on the later of six months from the effective date of the registration statement related to the IPO and the consummation of a Business Combination. The Unit Purchase Option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holders option, and expires five years from the effective date of the registration statement related to the IPO. The Units issuable upon exercise of the Unit Purchase Option are identical to those offered in the IPO. The Company accounts for the Unit Purchase Option, inclusive of the receipt of $100 cash payment, as an expense of the IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The option and the underlying securities that may be issued upon exercise of the option, have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRAs NASDAQ Conduct Rules. Additionally, the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day period) following the date of IPO except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the IPO and their bona fide officers or partners. The Unit Purchase Option grants to holders demand and piggy back rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the Unit Purchase Option. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the Unit Purchase Option.\nNote 7 - Stockholders Equity\nCommon Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 15,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. On October 29, 2021, the Company effected a 1.2-for-1.0 stock split of common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 1,725,000 Insider Shares, for approximately $0.014 per share. At September 30, 2022, there were 2,001,389 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (excluding 6,900,000 shares subject to possible redemption).\nRights - Each holder of a right will receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the Unit purchase price paid for by investors in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively covert its rights in order to receive 1/20 share underlying each right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company).\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, holders of the rights might not receive the shares of common stock underlying the rights.\nWarrants - Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase three-fourths (3/4) of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share and will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination and 12 months from the closing of the IPO. However, no public warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days from the closing of the Companys initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire five years from the closing of the Companys initial Business Combination at 5:00 p.m., New York City time or earlier redemption.\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Companys initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.50 per share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Companys initial Business Combination, and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Companys common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Price) is below $9.50 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the Market Price, and the $16.50 per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the Market Value.\nThe Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n\u25cf in whole and not in part;\n\u25cf at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n\u25cf upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption, which the Company refers to as the 30-day redemption period;\n\u25cf if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the to the warrant holders.\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.\nExcept as described above, no warrants will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue common stock unless at the time a holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the common stock have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to do so and, if the Company does not maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and the Company will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the common stock is not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the Company will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless.\nThe private warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in the IPO except that the private warrants will be entitled to registration rights. The private warrants (including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination except to permitted transferees.\nNote 8 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Companys financial assets and liabilities reflects managements estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1:\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2:\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3:\nUnobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe following table presents information about the Companys assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2022 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value.\nSeptember 30,\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive\nMarkets\n(Level 1) Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) Significant\nOther\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nAssets\nTrust Account - U.S. Treasury Securities Money Market Fund $ 69,286,800 $ 69,286,800 -\n-\nNote 9 - Income Taxes\nThe Companys net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax asset\nNet operating loss carryforward\n$ -\nStartup/Organization Expenses\n20,396\nTotal deferred tax asset\n20,396\nValuation allowance\n(20,396 )\nDeferred tax asset, net of allowance\n$ -\nThe income tax provision consists of the following:\nFor the\nYear ended\nSeptember 30,\nFederal\nCurrent $ 49,057\nDeferred (20,294 )\nState\nCurrent $ -\nDeferred -\nChange in valuation allowance 20,294\nIncome tax provision $ 49,057\nA reconciliation of the Companys statutory income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the\nYear ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncome at U.S. statutory rate 21.00 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 0.00 %\nTransaction costs (30.26 )%\nChange in valuation allowance (6.53 )%\n(15.80 )%\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company did not have any U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income.\nIn assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance was $20,294 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe provisions for U.S. federal and state income taxes were $49,057 and $0 for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from July 21, 2021 (inception) to September 30, 2021, respectively. The Companys tax returns for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 remain open and subject to examination.\nNote 10 - Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through December 6, 2022 when the financial statements were issued. Other than described below, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz and BitFuFu entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things: 1) for a loan from BitFuFu to Arisz in the amount of $2,220,000 (the Loan) for the purpose of funding Ariszs extension of the time to consummate a business combination and for working capital purposes, 2) remove all existing restrictions on 400,000 Insider Shares that are currently subject to transfer restrictions, so that such shares are freely tradeable upon the Closing. The Loan will be funded in three equal installments of $740,000 on each of October 26, 2022, January 26, 2023 and April 26, 2023, and 3) extend the Outside Date to August 1, 2023.\nOn October 10, 2022, Arisz issued an unsecured promissory note to BitFuFu for the amount of the Loan at an interest rate of 3.5% per annum and is due on October 26, 2023. Arisz may elect to issue a number of unregistered shares of its common stock, valued for these purposes at $10.00 per share, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loan.\nOn October 13, 2022, the parties to the Backstop Agreement entered into a new backstop agreement substantially on the same terms as the Backstop Agreement with the only substantive additional terms being that: 1) the subscription amount is $2.0 million worth of shares and 2) the termination date is the earlier of: (i) the date agreed by the parties thereto in writing and (ii) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated, on its terms.\nOn October 24, 2022, Arisz received $740,000, the first installment of the Loan, from BitFuFu.\nOn November 9, 2022, Arisz deposited $690,000 into the Trust Account (representing $0.10 per each share of redeemable common stock) to extend the time for Arisz to complete the Business Combination by three months until February 17, 2023.\nArisz Acquisition Corp. 845-9945\n0.55 0.00 1.85\nfalse FY\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\n2022-12-06\n2021-06-30\n2022-09-30\n2021-09-30\n2021-07-21 2021-09-30\nus-gaap:CommonStockMember\n2021-09-30\nus-gaap:AdditionalPaidInCapitalMember\n2021-09-30\nus-gaap:RetainedEarningsMember\n2021-09-30\nus-gaap:CommonStockMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:AdditionalPaidInCapitalMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:RetainedEarningsMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:CommonStockMember\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:AdditionalPaidInCapitalMember\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:RetainedEarningsMember\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:CommonStockMember\n2021-07-20\nus-gaap:AdditionalPaidInCapitalMember\n2021-07-20\nus-gaap:RetainedEarningsMember\n2021-07-20\n2021-07-20\nus-gaap:CommonStockMember\n2021-07-21 2021-09-30\nus-gaap:AdditionalPaidInCapitalMember\n2021-07-21 2021-09-30\nus-gaap:RetainedEarningsMember\n2021-07-21 2021-09-30\n2022-07-14\nus-gaap:CommonClassAMember\n2022-07-14\nariz:BitFuFuMember\n2022-10-10\n2022-10-26\n2023-01-26\n2023-04-26\n2022-10-10\n2022-10-13\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2021-11-22 2021-11-22\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2021-11-22\nariz:SponsorAndChardanCapitalMarketsLLCMember\n2021-11-22 2021-11-22\nariz:SponsorAndChardanCapitalMarketsLLCMember\n2021-11-22\n2021-08-05\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2021-10-01 2022-06-30\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2021-11-24 2021-11-24\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2021-11-24\nariz:PrivateUnitsMember\n2021-11-24 2021-11-24\nariz:PrivateUnitsMember\n2021-11-24\nariz:BusinessCombinationMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2022-09-30\nariz:BusinessCombinationMember\n2022-09-30\nariz:PublicSharesMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nariz:PublicSharesMember\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-11-19\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-11-01 2022-11-19\ncountry:US\n2022-08-16 2022-08-16\n2022-08-16 2022-08-16\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2022-09-30\nariz:RedeemableSharesMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nariz:NonRedeemableSharesMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nariz:RedeemableSharesMember\n2022-09-30\nariz:NonRedeemableSharesMember\n2022-09-30\nariz:RedeemableSharesMember\n2021-07-21 2021-09-30\nariz:NonRedeemableSharesMember\n2021-07-21 2021-09-30\nariz:RedeemableSharesMember\n2021-09-30\nariz:NonRedeemableSharesMember\n2021-09-30\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2021-11-01 2021-11-22\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2021-11-01 2021-11-22\nus-gaap:OverAllotmentOptionMember\n2021-11-01 2021-11-24\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:PrivatePlacementMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:PrivatePlacementMember\n2022-09-30\nariz:SponsorAndChardanMember\n2021-11-24 2021-11-24\nariz:SponsorAndChardanMember\n2021-11-24\n2021-08-01 2021-08-05\n2021-10-01 2021-10-29\nariz:InsiderSharesMember\n2021-10-29\nariz:InsiderSharesMember\n2021-10-01 2021-10-29\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2021-10-01 2021-10-29\nariz:InsiderSharesMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:IPOMember\n2021-08-01 2021-08-05\nariz:ChardanMember ariz:UnitPurchaseOptionMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nariz:UnitPurchaseOptionMember\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:CommonStockMember\n2021-10-01 2021-10-29\n2021-10-29\nus-gaap:WarrantMember\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:WarrantMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:FairValueInputsLevel1Member\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:FairValueInputsLevel2Member\n2022-09-30\nus-gaap:FairValueInputsLevel3Member\n2022-09-30\nariz:IncomeTaxMember\n2021-10-01 2022-09-30\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-10-10\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-10-10 2022-10-10\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-10-26 2022-10-26\nsrt:ScenarioForecastMember\n2023-01-26 2023-01-26\nsrt:ScenarioForecastMember\n2023-04-26 2023-04-26\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-10-13\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-10-24\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-11-09 2022-11-09\nus-gaap:SubsequentEventMember\n2022-11-09\nxbrli:shares\niso4217:USD\niso4217:USD\nxbrli:shares\nxbrli:pure"
