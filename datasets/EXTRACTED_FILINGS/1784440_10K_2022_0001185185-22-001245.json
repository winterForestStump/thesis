    "content": "Item 1. Business\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our ability to locate and acquire an operating business, the status of our current acquisition opportunity and the resources and efforts we intend to dedicate to such an endeavor, our development of a viable business plan and our ability to locate sources of capital necessary to meet our business needs and objectives. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Report, including statements that relate to our future financial performance, liquidity, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"approximate,\" should, intend, could, potential, is likely, plan, \"continue,\" and similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.\nThe results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors, uncertainties and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following Risk Factors before deciding whether to invest in the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our financial condition. If any of the events discussed in the Risk Factors below occur, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the value and marketability of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Closing of the Reverse Merger, Our Business and Financial Condition\nBecause we currently have no operations investors therefore have no basis on which to evaluate the Companys future prospects.\nWe currently have no operations and will be reliant upon a merger with or acquisition of an operating business like the Target to commence operations and generate revenue. Because we have no operations and have not generated revenues since our inception in 2019, investors have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of locating and completing a business combination with a target business. Until we close the reverse merger with the Target, assuming we do, we do not intend to disclose any material information concerning it so you will not have any basis to evaluate its business, management, financial condition or prospects.\nBecause the Term Sheet is non-binding, we may not consummate the acquisition of the Target or any other business.\nAlthough we have entered into the Term Sheet with the Target, we did not meet the requirement to execute a definitive agreement by the September 15, 2022 deadline and have yet to execute it. The Target recently consummated a financing in the amount of $50,000 with an investor and we therefore do not anticipate consummating the Financing if the reverse merger with the Target is consummated.\nWe may not execute a definitive agreement, raise any capital or close the transaction due to other reasons. Additionally, if we fail to close the acquisition of the Target, we may not consummate any other acquisition and may be forced to liquidate the company.\nSince the Target is not profitable, it may never achieve profitable operations.\nThe Target is a development stage business and has not generated material revenues and has incurred losses to date. Because it requires material investment and for a myriad of other reasons it may never generate material revenues or become profitable. If it does not, your investment may be worthless.\nBecause we have limited capital, we may need to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities, the terms of which may dilute our current investors and/or reduce or limit their liquidation or other rights.\nIf we acquire the Target, it may need additional capital to operate its business. . We may not be able to obtain additional capital when required. Future business development activities, as well as administrative expenses such as salaries, insurance, general overhead, legal and compliance expenses and accounting expenses will require a substantial amount of additional capital.\nThe terms of securities we issue in future capital raising transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include liquidation preferences, superior voting rights or the issuance of other derivative securities, which could have a further dilutive effect on or subordinate the rights of our current investors. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity securities will likely dilute the ownership percentage of our shareholders. Additionally, any debt securities we issue would likely create a liquidation preference superior to that of our current investors and, if convertible into shares of common stock, would also pose the risk of dilution.\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary financing if and when required.\nOur ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both in general and in the particular industry or industries in which we may choose to operate), our limited operating history and lack of operations, the national and global economies and the condition of the market for microcap securities. Further, economic downturns including the recession we may be entering combined with high inflation and investor uncertainties may increase our requirements for capital, particularly if such economic downturn persists for an extended period of time or after we have acquired an operating entity, and may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding we require. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from future operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain financing on unattractive terms. If any of the foregoing should happen, our shareholders could lose some or all of their investment.\nBecause we are dependent upon Justin Earl, our President and sole director to manage and oversee our Company, the loss of him or any difficulty hiring or retaining other key personnel could adversely affect our plan and results of operations.\nWe currently have a sole director and officer, Justin Earl, who manages the Company and is presently evaluating a viable plan for our future operations. We will rely solely on his judgment in connection with selecting and negotiating the terms and structure of any resulting business combination including that with the Target.\nIf the Target acquisition does not close, or if Mr. Earl were unavailable, we may be unable to cause the Company to elect a replacement director. In that event we would cease operations. Further, because Mr. Earl serves as President and sole director and also holds a controlling interest in the Companys common stock, our other shareholders will have limited ability to influence the Companys direction or management.\nIn addition, we expect Mr. Earl to resign upon completion of a reverse merger. The loss of key personnel, either before or after a business combination and including management of either us or a combined entity could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and our shareholders, director, or management, which may have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination or favorable terms or generate revenue.\nWhile our President, Mr. Earl, is not required to commit his full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating his time between managing the Company and other businesses in which he is or may be involved, we are not certain if the management of the Target or any other business we acquire will not have this or other conflicts of interest. It is possible that in addition to conflicts of time or the hiring of family members or other related parties, the Target or any other company we acquire may face other conflicts including using vendors or customers which are related parties and result in unfair terms to us.\nIt is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded any opportunity to evaluate or approve a business combination.\nIt is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded the opportunity to evaluate and approve a proposed business combination. In most cases, business combinations do not require shareholder approval under applicable law, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not afford our shareholders with the right to approve such a transaction. Further, Mr. Earl, our President and sole director, owns a majority of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, our shareholders will be relying almost exclusively on the judgement of our board of directors (Board) and President and any persons on whom they may rely with respect to a potential business combination. If we proceed with the acquisition of the Target, our shareholders will not be able to vote on it or have any participation in it or knowledge until we disclose appropriate information in SEC filings or through a press release. If we terminate discussions with the target and reach an understanding with another business, we may in the future hire lawyers, accountants, technical experts, appraisers, or other consultants to assist with determining the Companys direction and consummating any transactions contemplated thereby. We may rely on such persons in making difficult decisions in connection with the Companys future business and prospects. The selection of any such persons will be made by our Board, and any expenses incurred or decisions made based on any of the foregoing could prove to be adverse to the Company in hindsight, the result of which could be diminished value to our shareholders.\nBecause our search for a business combination is not presently limited to a particular industry, sector or any specific businesses, prospective investors will be unable to evaluate the merits or risks of any particular target business operations until such time as they are identified and disclosed.\nBecause we have not yet entered into any binding letter of intent or agreement to acquire a particular business, prospective investors currently have no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, prospects or other metrics or qualities they deem appropriate in considering to invest in the Company. Further, if we complete a business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business we acquire. For example, if we acquire a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established operating history, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a new business or a development stage entity. Although our management intends to evaluate and weigh the merits and risks inherent in a particular target business and make a decision based on the Company and its shareholders interests, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all the significant risks inherent in a target business, that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence or that we will ultimately acquire a viable business and generate material revenue therefrom. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to reduce the likelihood that those risks will adversely impact a target business or mitigate any harm to the Company caused thereby. Should we select a course of action, or fail to select a course of action, that ultimately exposes us to unknown or unidentified risks, our business will be harmed and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nOur ability to assess the management of a prospective business may be limited and, as a result, we may acquire a business whose management does not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to enable a seamless transition, which could, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of a potential business combination such as the Target, our ability to assess the reverse merger candidates businesss management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our managements assessment of the capabilities of the targets management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities expected. Should the targets management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company or assist with the Targets (or other company) integration into ours, the operations and profitability of the post-acquisition business may be negatively impacted and our shareholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares.\nAny business we acquire will likely lack diversity of operations or geographical reach, and in such case we will be subject to risks associated with dependence on a single industry or region.\nOur search for a business will likely be focused on entities with a single or limited business activity and/or that operate in a limited geographic area such as with the Target. While larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversifying their operations among different industries and regions, smaller companies such as ours and the entities we anticipate reviewing for a potential business combination generally lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of their business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by risks affecting the industry or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. In addition to general economic risks, we could be exposed to natural disasters, civil unrest, technological advances, and other uncontrollable developments that will threaten our viability if and to the extent our future operations are limited to a single industry or region. If we do not diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations will be at risk.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to us, may adversely affect our business, ability to negotiate and complete a business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by federal, state and local governments. Any business we acquire in the future may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory oversight and restrictions, which could hinder our growth and expend material amounts on compliance. For example, the Target has to deal with possible regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission and states that regulate unfair trade practices, among other laws and regulations. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application by courts and administrative judges may also change from time to time, and any such changes could be unfavorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could result in material defense or remedial costs and/or damages have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nDue to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile.\nThere is currently a limited market for our common stock, and there can be no guarantee that an active market for our common stock will develop, even if we are successful in consummating a business combination. As of October 26, 2022, there were only 13 record holders of our common stock, and trading is very limited and sporadic. Further, even if an active market for our common stock develops, it will likely be subject to significant price volatility when compared to more seasoned issuers. We expect that the price of our common stock will continue to be more volatile than more seasoned issuers for the foreseeable future. Fluctuations in the price of our common stock can be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this Report, including:\n\u25cf\nA prospective business combination and the terms and conditions thereof;\n\u25cf\nThe operating performance of any business we acquire, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom;\n\u25cf\nThe performance of our competitors in the marketplace, both pre- and post-combination;\n\u25cf\nThe publics reaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information;\n\u25cf\nChanges in earnings estimates of any business that we acquire or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies in the industry of a business that we acquire;\n\u25cf\nVariations in general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events ;\n\u25cf\nThe public disclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future;\n\u25cf\nThe number of shares of our common stock that are publicly traded in the future;\n\u25cf\nActions of our existing shareholders, including sales of common stock by our then directors and then executive officers or by significant investors; and\n\u25cf\nThe employment or termination of key personnel.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether we can consummate a business combination and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.\nBecause trading in our common stock is so limited, investors who purchase our common stock may depress the market if they sell common stock.\nOur common stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, the successor to the pink sheets. The OTC Pink Market generally is illiquid and most stocks traded there are of companies that are not required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. While we voluntarily file Forms 10-Q and 10-K with the SEC, we are a voluntary filer and not required to file reports with the SEC. Our common stock itself infrequently trades. For example, between July 1, 2021 and August 30, 2022 there were just six days in which trades occurred, with the maximum trade volume during that time being 4,000 shares on July 7, 2021.Accordingly, any sales may depress the trading price.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are sold at once or in large blocks.\nPresently the market for our common stock is limited. If an active market for our shares develops in the future, some or all of our shareholders may sell their shares of our common stock which may depress the market price. Further, Rule 144 will not be available since we are a shell company, unless we become a mandatory filer and 12 months passes from the filing of what is called Form 10 information. Any sale of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, which could reduce the value of the shares held by our other shareholders. Further, the Term Sheet envisions that following of the closing we must file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register the common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock issued to the investors in conjunction with the closing. While the number of shares may not be large, the filing of a Registration Statement often results in a drop in the price of a companys common stock.\nFuture issuances of our common stock could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, particularly in connection with an acquisition and any resulting financing.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of our common stock or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock could substantially dilute the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target companys former equity holders in a business combination which received our common stock as consideration, or by investors who had previously acquired such common stock, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nBecause our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, brokers cannot generally solicit the purchase of our common stock, which adversely affects its liquidity and market price.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock on the OTC Pink Market is presently less than $5.00 per share and therefore we are considered a penny stock company according to SEC rules. Further, we do not expect our stock price to rise above $5.00 in the foreseeable future. The penny stock designation requires any broker-dealer selling our securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules limit the ability of broker-dealers to solicit purchases of our common stock and therefore reduce the liquidity of the public market for our shares.\nMoreover, as a result of apparent regulatory pressure from the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a growing number of broker-dealers decline to permit investors to purchase and sell or otherwise make it difficult to sell shares of penny stocks. The penny stock designation may have a depressive effect upon our common stock price.\nBecause of FINRA sales practice requirements which affect broker-dealers, the market price for our common stock will be adversely affected.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy shares of our common stock, which may limit our shareholders ability to buy and sell our common stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. Further, due to FINRA regulation, there are a limited number of broker dealers which will handle penny stocks, which impairs the market and reduces the market price.\nDue to changes to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our common stock may become subject to limitations or reductions on stock price, liquidity or volume.\nOn September 28, 2021, the SECs amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act became effective. This Rule applies to broker-dealers who quote securities listed on over-the-counter markets such as our common stock. The Rule as amended prohibits broker-dealers from publishing quotations on OTC markets for an issuers securities unless they are based on current publicly available information about the issuer. The amended Rule will also limits the Rules piggyback exception, which allows broker-dealers to publish quotations for a security in reliance on the quotations of a broker-dealer that initially performed the information review required by the Rule, to issuers with current publicly available information or issuers that are up-to-date in their Exchange Act reports. As of this date, we are uncertain as what actual effect the Rule may have on us.\nUpon the effective date of the Rule amendments, the OTC Markets has passed a rule that permits shell companies to trade for only 18 months after September 28, 2021. As a result, we will need to acquire an operating business within the prescribed timeframe in order for our common stock to continue to be quoted on the OTC Pink Market. Failure to consummate the acquisition of the Target could negatively affect our growth strategies and investors ability to sell our common stock.\nThe Rule changes could harm the liquidity and/or market price of our common stock by either preventing our shares from being quoted or driving up our costs of compliance. Because we are a voluntary filer under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and not a public reporting company, the practical impact of these changes is to require us to maintain a level of periodic disclosure we are not presently required to maintain, which would cause us to incur material additional expenses. Further, if we cannot or do not provide or maintain current public information about our company, our stockholders may face difficulties in selling their shares of our common stock at desired prices, quantities or times, or at all, as a result of the amendments to the Rule.\nBecause we may issue preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders and have other anti-takeover defenses, and the vast majority of our commons stock outstanding is held by our President and sole director, it may be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nOur Board may issue, without a vote of our shareholders, one or more series of preferred stock that have voting rights, liquidation preferences, dividend rights and other rights that are superior to those of our common stock. Any issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock in that such preferred stock could have priority over the common stock with respect to voting, dividend or liquidation rights. Further, because we can issue preferred stock having voting rights per share that are greater than the equivalent of one share of our common stock, our Board could issue preferred stock to investors who support us and our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Even absent such an issuance of preferred stock, the majority of our common stock outstanding is held by Justin Earl, who controls the Company as its sole officer and director. Additionally, issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock and/or cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.  Item 2. Properties\nOur principal place of business is 2825 East Cottonwood Parkway Suite 500 - #5130, Salt Lake City, UT 84121. It is a virtual office provided by a third-party with a month-to-month lease.\nWe believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs. We do not own any real estate. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not currently a party in any legal proceeding or governmental regulatory proceeding nor are we currently aware of any pending or potential legal proceeding or governmental regulatory proceeding proposed to be initiated against us that would have a material adverse effect on us or our business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is not listed on any securities exchange, and is quoted on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol NOTR. Because our common stock is not listed on a securities exchange and its quotations on the OTC Pink Market are limited and sporadic, there is currently no established public trading market for our common stock.\nThe following table reflects the high and low closing sales information for our common stock for each fiscal quarter during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021. This information was obtained from the OTC Pink Market and reflects inter-dealer prices without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nCOMMON STOCK MARKET PRICE\nHIGH\nLOW\nFISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2022:\nFirst Quarter\n$ 3.75\n$ 3.22\nSecond Quarter\n$ 3.75\n$ 3.75\nThird Quarter\n$ 3.75\n$ 3.75\nFourth Quarter\n$ 9.00\n$ 3.75\nCOMMON STOCK MARKET PRICE\nHIGH\nLOW\nFISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2021:\nFirst Quarter\n$ 0.02\n$ 0.02\nSecond Quarter\n$ 0.02\n$ 0.02\nThird Quarter\n$ 0.02\n$ 0.02\nFourth Quarter\n$ 4.15\n$ 0.02\nNumber of Holders\nAs of October 26, 2022, 5,461,500 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, which were held by 13 stockholders of record.\nStock Transfer Agent\nOur stock transfer agent is Secure Stock Transfer, 360 Central Ave, Suite 877, St. Petersburg, FL, 33701, (727) 776-5286, anna@securestocktransfer.com, www.securestocktransfer.com.\nDividends\nNo cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nSecurities Authorized For Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nWe currently do not have any equity compensation plans.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nConsistent with the rules applicable to smaller reporting entities, we have omitted the information required by Item 6. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe Company has no operations or revenue as of the date of this Report. Our goal is to pursue discussions with the Target and seek to close its acquisition. However, we cannot assure you we will close the acquisition.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagements discussion and analysis and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses. Our actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nResults of Operations\nWe are a start-up corporation with no operations and no revenues from our business operations. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months. We do not anticipate that we will generate significant revenues until we have raised the funds necessary to engage in a reverse merger or other business combination or otherwise commence operations. There is no assurance we will ever commence material operations or generate revenue even if we raise all necessary funds.\nFISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2022 COMPARED TO AUGUST 31, 2021\nOur net loss for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 was $83,208 compared to a net loss of $25,610 during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021; the Company has not generated any revenue in either period. The increase was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses including professional fees in connection with the preparation of SEC reports and our ongoing search for a business to acquire including one transaction that did not close and resulted in higher legal expenses. Expenses incurred were general and administrative expenses of $91,921 during fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, off set by a gain on forgiveness of debt in the amount of $8,713, compared to $25,610 during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of August 31, 2022, our total assets were $16,253 consisting of cash. As of August 31, 2021, our total assets were $6,314 consisting of prepaid expenses and cash.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities since inception. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, cash flows used in operating activities were $85,782, consisting of our net loss of $83,208, a non cash gain on forgiveness of debt of $8,713, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $4,279, and an increase in accounts payable of $1,860. Cash flows used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 were $29,439, consisting of our net loss of $25,610 and increases of $4,279 in prepaid expenses and $450 in accrued interest.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe have not engaged in any investing activities since our inception.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $100,000 consisting of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, net cash flows provided by financing activities was $10,845 consisting of $2,893 in related party advances, $7,050 in related party notes payable, and $1,200 in proceeds from a loan, partially offset by a principal payment of $298 on a loan.\nOur existing working capital is not expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we close the acquisition of the Target, we will not, with the Targets existing cash resources, meet our working capital needs for the 12 months following the filing of this Report. We have financed operations to date through the proceeds of loans from insiders and the private placement of equity. We expect we will need to raise additional capital to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.\nOn November 3, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchaser 100,000 shares of the Companys Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series A) at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (the Offering). The Company received $100,000 in gross proceeds from the Offering, before deducting legal fees and related offering expenses. Each share of the Series A is convertible into three shares of the Companys common stock.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nGoing Concern\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have no operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in acquiring an operating business or commencing material business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the search for and establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.\nThere can be no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms as and when needed, we may be unable to commence, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 5732)\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations\nStatements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit)\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nSpiegel Accountancy Corp.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Director and Stockholders of\nNowtransit Inc.\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NOWTRANSIT INC (the Company) as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders ' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended August 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company is in the process of raising capital, has accumulated losses since inception, and has not generated revenue. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such op inion.\nTo the Board of Director and Stockholders of\nNowtransit Inc.\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nBasis for Opinion (Continued)\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nPleasant Hill, California\nNovember 1, 2022\nSpiegel Accountancy Corp.\nCertified Public Accountants\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\nNOWTRANSIT INC\nBALANCE SHEETS\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash\n$ 16,253\n$ 2,035\nPrepaid expenses\n-\n4,279\nTotal current assets\n16,253\n6,314\nTotal assets\n$ 16,253\n$ 6,314\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable\n$ 1,860\n$ -\nAccrued interest - related party\n-\nDue to related parties\n-\n2,893\nLoan payable\n-\n8,713\nNote payable - related party\n-\n7,050\nTotal liabilities\n1,860\n19,106\nStockholders' equity (deficit)\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized; 1,000,000 designated Series A Convertible\nPreferred stock, Series A Convertible; $0.0001 par value, 100,000 and 0 shares issued and outstanding at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n-\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized, 5,461,500 shares issued and outstanding\nAdditional paid-in capital\n131,237\n20,854\nAccumulated deficit\n(117,400 )\n(34,192 )\nTotal stockholders' equity (deficit)\n14,393\n(12,792 )\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity (deficit)\n$ 16,253\n$ 6,314\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements.\nNOWTRANSIT INC\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the\nFor the\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nRevenue\n$ -\n$ -\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n91,921\n25,610\nTotal operating expenses\n91,921\n25,610\nNet loss from operations\n(91,921 )\n(25,610 )\nOther Income:\nGain on forgiveness of debt\n8,713\n-\nTotal other income\n8,713\n-\nNet loss before income taxes\n(83,208 )\n(25,610 )\nProvision for income taxes\n-\n-\nNet loss\n$ (83,208 )\n$ (25,610 )\nNet loss per share - basic and diluted\n$ (0.02 )\n$ (0.00 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted\n5,461,500\n5,461,500\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements.\nNOWTRANSIT INC\nSTATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nTotal\nSeries A Convertible\nAdditional\nStockholders'\nPreferred Stock\nCommon Stock\nPaid-In\nAccumulated\nEquity\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nCapital\nDeficit\n(Deficit)\nBalance, August 31, 2020\n-\n-\n5,461,500\n$\n$ 20,854\n$ (8,582 )\n$ 12,818\nNet loss for the year ended August 31, 2021\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(25,610 )\n(25,610 )\nBalance, August 31, 2021\n-\n$ -\n5,461,500\n$\n$ 20,854\n$ (34,192 )\n$ (12,792 )\nIssuance of preferred stock for cash\n100,000\n-\n-\n99,990\n-\n100,000\nForgiveness of related party debt\n-\n-\n-\n-\n10,393\n-\n10,393\nNet loss for the year ended August 31, 2022\n-\n-\n-\n(83,208 )\n(83,208 )\nBalance, August 31, 2022\n100,000\n$\n5,461,500\n$\n$ 131,237\n$ (117,400 )\n$ 14,393\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements.\nNOWTRANSIT INC\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the\nFor the\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet loss\n$ (83,208 )\n$ (25,610 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to cash used in operating activities:\nGain on forgiveness of debt\n(8,713 )\n-\nChanges in assets and liabilities:\nPrepaid expenses\n4,279\n(4,279 )\nAccounts payable\n1,860\n-\nAccrued interest - related party\n-\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(85,782 )\n(29,439 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nPrincipal payments on loan\n-\n(298 )\nProceeds from related party\n-\n2,893\nProceeds from loan payable\n-\n1,200\nProceeds from note payable - related party\n-\n7,050\nProceeds from issuance of preferred stock\n100,000\n-\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n100,000\n10,845\nNet increase (decrease) in cash\n14,218\n(18,594 )\nCash at beginning of period\n2,035\n20,629\nCash at end of period\n$ 16,253\n$ 2,035\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid for interest\n$ -\n$ -\nCash paid for income taxes\n$ -\n$ -\nSCHEDULE OF NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:\nReclassification of loan payable - related party to loan payable\n$ -\n$ 8,251\nForgiveness of related party debt\n$ 10,393\n$ -\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements.\nNOWTRANSIT INC\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021\nNOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nNowtransit Inc. (the Company, us, we) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2019. We have not generated material revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We were formed to engage in the online delivery business, but in connection with the Change of Control described in the following paragraph, the Company has terminated its plans in the online delivery business. Since the Change of Control, we commenced seeking new business opportunities in the United States.\nOn April 2, 2021, Justin Earl purchased from Ivan Homici 2,800,000 shares of common stock of Nowtransit Inc. (the Company), for a total purchase price of $28,000 (the Change of Control). The Change of Control was affected pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 2, 2021 by and among Mr. Earl as the purchaser, and Mr. Homici, the Companys majority shareholder and sole director and officer, as the seller. Following the Change of Control, Mr. Earl owns 2,800,000 shares of common stock, which constitutes approximately 51.3% of the common stock issued and outstanding.\nOn July 29, 2021, Mr. Homici resigned as the Companys director, President, Treasurer and Secretary and was replaced in each such role by Mr. Earl.\nNOTE 2: GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $117,400 as of August 31, 2022, and $34,192 as of August 31, 2021. The Company had losses of $83,208 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and $25,610 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of managements efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.\nEconomic downturns, including the recession we may be entering, combined with high inflation and investor uncertainties may increase our requirements for capital, particularly if such economic downturn persists for an extended period of time or after we have acquired an operating entity, and may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding we require. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from future operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, the Companys future operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nNOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). The Companys year-end is August 31.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $16,253 and $2,035 in cash as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and no cash equivalents.\nConcentration of Credit Risks\nThe Company maintains funds in a financial institution that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As such, funds are insured based on Federal Reserve limits. At August 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have cash deposits in excess of these insured limits.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFASB ASC Topic 820, \"Fair Value Measurement,\" defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standards apply to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Company determines the fair values of its assets and liabilities based on a fair value hierarchy that includes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.\nThe three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1:\ndefined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2:\ndefined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3:\ndefined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nDue to the short-term nature, the carrying values of the Companys current assets and liabilities approximated fair value at August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a C Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code and a similar section of the state code.\nAll income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under accounting for income taxes. Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes arising primarily from differences between financial and tax reporting purposes. Current year expense represents the amount of income taxes paid, payable or refundable for the period.\nDeferred income taxes, net of appropriate valuation allowances, are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. When an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit or expense to recognize in the financial statements.\nThe Companys income tax returns are subject to review and examination by federal, state and local governmental authorities.\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share\nThe Company computes loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholder by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of August 31, 2022, there were 300,000 issuable securities from Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilute. As of August 31, 2021, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible Preferred Stock, as well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entitys own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on January 1, 2022, including interim periods within such fiscal year. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We have elected to early adopt ASU 2020-06 effective September 1, 2021 with no material impact to the financial statements.\nWe do not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 4: LOAN PAYABLE\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a third party for $760. The loan was without interest and payable upon demand. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company reclassified the amount of $8,251 from Due to Related Parties to Loan Payable. This amount represents a loan made to the Company by its former President, Ivan Homici, including $1,200 received during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. Mr. Homici was no longer considered a related party of the Company at August 31, 2021. Also during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company applied the balance of $298 in a bank account to the amount owed to Mr. Homici. On February 11, 2022, the third party loan in the amount of $760 and the loan from Mr. Homici in the amount of $7,953 were forgiven resulting in a gain on forgiveness of debt in the amount of $8,713. At August 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount classified as Loan Payable on the Companys balance sheet is $0 and $8,713, respectively.\nNOTE 5: DUE TO RELATED PARTIES\nIn August 2021, the Company received a loan in the amount of $2,893 from Justin Earl, its President and a director. On August 16, 2022 the loan from Mr. Earl in the amount of $2,893 was forgiven. The related party loan forgiveness is considered a capital transaction and is included in Additional-paid-in capital on the Companys balance sheet. At August 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of loans due to Mr. Earl was $0 and $2,893, respectively.\nNOTE 6: NOTE PAYABLE - RELATED PARTIES\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Promissory Note agreement (the OO Marketing Promissory Note) with OO Marketing, a consulting firm owned by Justin Earl, the Companys President and director, in the principal amount of $7,050. The OO Marketing Promissory Note was unsecured, bore a one-time interest charge in the amount of $450, and was payable upon demand. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company recorded interest expense in the amount of $450 on the OO Marketing Promissory Note. On August 16, 2022, the OO Marketing Promissory Note in the amount of $7,050 and accrued interest in the amount of $450 was forgiven. The related party note payable forgiveness is considered a capital transaction and is included in Additional-paid-in capital on the Companys balance sheet. At August 31, 2022, the amount due under the OO Marketing Promissory Note was principal and accrued interest of $0. At August 31, 2021, the amount due under the OO Marketing Promissory Note was principal of $7,050 and accrued interest of $450.\nNOTE 7: STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has 75,000,000, $0.0001 par value shares of voting common stock authorized.\nThere were no issuances of common stock during the years ended August 31, 2022 or 2021.\nAs of August 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 5,461,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\nAll shares of common stock have voting rights and are identical. All holders of shares of common stock shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of the capital stock held by such stockholder.\nPreferred Stock\nOn October 19, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation authorizing up to 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, with such rights, preferences and limitations as may be set forth in resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. On November 1, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation designating 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series A). Each share of the Series A is convertible into three shares of the Companys common stock at the holder's election, subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation which may be increased to 9.99% upon 61 days notice. On November 3, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which the Company sold to the purchaser 100,000 shares of the Series A at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (the Offering). The Company received $100,000 in gross proceeds from the Offering.\nThe Company had 100,000 and 0 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001, outstanding at August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 8: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against it. At August 31, 2022, there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company has a month-to-month lease. Annual expense for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 was $864 and $0, respectively.\nNOTE 9: INCOME TAXES\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at August 31, 2022 and 2021 will not be realizable.\nAccordingly, management has maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at August 31, 2022 and 2021. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the periods ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 was an increase of $17,474 and $5,378, respectively.\nAt August 31, 2022 and 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $24,654 and $7,180, respectively.\nThe income tax benefit (provision) is comprised of the following:\nYear ended\nAugust 31, 2022\nYear ended\nAugust 31, 2021\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$ -\n$ -\nState\n$ -\n$ -\nA reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:\nYear ended\nAugust 31, 2022\nYear ended\nAugust 31, 2021\nUnited States federal statutory rate\n21.00\n%\n21.00\n%\nState taxes net of federal benefit\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nValuation allowance\n(21.00\n%)\n(21.00\n%)\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nDeferred tax assets consisted of the following:\nAugust 31, 2022\nAugust 31, 2021\nNet operating loss carryforward\n$ 24,654\n$ 7,180\nValuation allowance\n(24,654\n)\n(7,180\n)\nDeferred tax assets after valuation allowance\n$ -\n$ -\nNOTE 10: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Companys former director provided office space to the Company at no charge.\nFrom time to time, the Company has received loans from related parties for working capital purposes. During the year ended August 31, 2022, $10,393 in related party loans and interest were forgiven. See notes 5 and 6.\nNOTE 11: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855 Subsequent Events, the Company has analyzed its operations through the date the financial statements were issued and noted no items requiring disclosure. Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur principal executive officer (who is also our principal financial officer) carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on his evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our President who serves as principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013)(COSO).\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has concluded that as of August 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the material weaknesses described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, the Companys management determined that there were control deficiencies resulting in the following material weaknesses.\n1.\nThe Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions due to only having one officer and limited resources.\n2.\nThe Company does not have an independent Board of Directors or an Audit Committee. While the Company is not legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the managements view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Companys financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over managements activities.\n3.\nThe Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures.\n4.\nAll of the Companys financial reporting is carried out by a financial consultant.\n5.\nWe did not maintain appropriate cash controls - As of August 31, 2022, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Companys bank accounts.\n6.\nWe did not implement appropriate information technology controls - As at August 31, 2022, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Companys data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.\nAccordingly, the Companys management concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent Board of Directors, establishing written policies and procedures for our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we complete a reverse merger or similar business acquisition.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report. Item 9B. Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\nPART III Item 10.

Prior to his appointment, Mr. Earl has served as President of Strategic Junction since November 2011 where he leads all company initiatives related to improving business continuity through risk management, network hardening, and redundant systems. Since November 2011, Mr. Earl has served as President of OO Marketing, a consulting firm. Prior to that role, Mr. Earl served as President of Strategic Network Solutions from January, 2005 until November, 2011 where he led all efforts to enhance the security posture for financial institutions through penetration testing, client education, and network hardening. Based upon his experience advising businesses, we believe that Mr. Earl is qualified to serve on our Board.\nElection of Directors and Officers\nDirectors are elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve until the meeting of the Board following the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified.\nAudit Committee\nWe do not have any committees of the Board as we only have one director. Our Board acts as the Companys Audit Committee as required.\nDirector Independence\nWe use the definition of independence of The Nasdaq Stock Market to make the determination of director independence. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Companys Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Under such definitions, our sole director cannot be considered an independent director.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nWe have chosen to combine the President and Board Chairman positions because one person is our sole officer and director.\nCode of Ethics\nOur Board has not adopted a Code of Ethics due to the Companys size and lack of employees other than our sole officer. As of the date of this Report, our sole director is also our President.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nThe Company does not have a class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act; therefore, this Item is not applicable.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following table shows the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 26, 2022 held by (i) each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of our common stock; (ii) each director; (iii) each executive officer; and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group.\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and generally includes voting power and/or investment power with respect to the securities held.\nThe following table provides for percentage ownership assuming 5,461,500 shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2022.

The number and percentage of shares beneficially owned is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose.
