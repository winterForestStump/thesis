    "content": "Item 1. Business\nLimoneira Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to several businesses with operations in California since 1893. Our business and operations are described below. For detailed financial information with respect to our business and our operations, see our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 in this Annual Report. In addition, general information concerning our Company can be found on our website at www.limoneira.com. All of our filings with the SEC, including but not limited to, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The contents of our website referred to above are not incorporated into this Annual Report. Further, any references to our website are intended to be interactive textual references only.\nOverview\nWe are primarily an agribusiness company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 11,100 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate and capital investment activities.\nAgribusiness activities are performed through these four reporting segments:\nWe are one of Californias oldest citrus growers. According to Sunkist Growers, Inc., we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the United States and, according to the California Avocado Commission, one of the largest growers of avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura and San Luis Obispo in California and Yuma County in Arizona, La Serena, Chile and Jujuy, Argentina, which collectively consist of approximately 3,500 acres of lemons, 1,200 acres of avocados, 100 acres of oranges and 400 acres of wine grapes. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons that we grow, as well as lemons grown by others. We have a 47% interest in Rosales S.A. (Rosales), a citrus packing, marketing and sales business, a 90% interest in Fruticola Pan de Azucar S.A. (PDA), a lemon and orange orchard and a 100% interest in Agricola San Pablo, SpA (San Pablo), a lemon and orange orchard, all of which are located near La Serena, Chile. We have a 51% interest in a joint venture, Trapani Fresh Consorcio de Cooperacion (Trapani Fresh), a lemon orchard in Argentina.\nOur water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We also use surface water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District (YMIDD). We use ground water provided by wells and surface water for our PDA and San Pablo farming operations in Chile and our Trapani Fresh farming operations in Argentina. We use ground water from the San Joaquin Valley Basin and water from local water and irrigation districts in Tulare County, which is in Californias San Joaquin Valley. We used ground water from the Cadiz Valley Basin in California's San Bernardino County.\nFor more than 100 years, we have been making strategic investments in California agriculture and real estate. We currently have an interest in two real estate development projects in California. These projects include multi-family housing, single-family homes and apartments of approximately 800 units in various stages of planning and development.\nFiscal Year 2023 Highlights and Recent Developments\nOn October 10, 2022, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, as amended (the Agreement), with PGIM Real Estate Finance, LLC (PGIM) to sell 3,537 acres of land and citrus orchards in Tulare County, California (the Northern Properties) for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $100.0 million. The agreement became effective on January 25, 2023, when the Board of Directors (the Board) approved the Agreement, binding us to sell the Northern Properties and the transaction closed on January 31, 2023. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $98.4 million and recorded a gain of approximately $40.0 million. The proceeds were used primarily to pay down debt.\nOn January 31, 2023, we entered into a Farm Management Agreement (the FMA) with an affiliate of PGIM to provide farming, management and operations services related to the Northern Properties. The FMA has an initial term expiring March 31, 2024, and thereafter continuing from year to year unless earlier terminated under the terms of the FMA. Further, on January 31, 2023, we entered into a Grower Packing and Marketing Agreement to provide packing, marketing and selling services for lemons harvested on the Northern Properties for a minimum five-year term, subject to certain benchmarking standards.\nDuring the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Company made funding contributions of $2.5 million to fully fund and settle the plan obligations of the Limoneira Company Retirement Plan. Lump sum payments were made to a portion of the active and vested terminated participants and annuities were purchased for all remaining participants from an insurance company. There are no remaining benefit obligations or plan assets and the remaining accumulated other comprehensive loss was fully recognized.\nOn November 30, 2022, we sold our Sevilla property, received net proceeds of $2.6 million and recorded an immaterial loss in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nOn April 18, 2023, we entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release (the Settlement Agreement) with Southern California Edison and Edison International to formally resolve any and all claims related to the Thomas Fire in fiscal year 2018. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company was awarded a total settlement of $9.0 million. On May 19, 2023, the Company received approximately $6.1 million, net of legal and related costs.\nIn April 2023, we determined that citrus farming operations were economically unviable on 670 acres of leased agricultural land at the Cadiz Ranch. As a result, we ceased farming operations, disposed of the related property, plant and equipment and recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $9.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nIn August 2023, we engaged with YMIDD and the United States Bureau of Reclamation in a fallowing and forbearance program at our Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. (Associated) ranch in Yuma, Arizona. We expect to receive approximately $1.3 million annually, paid in quarterly installments, for fallowing approximately 600 acres out of 1,300 acres of farmland through calendar year 2025.\nIn October 2023, Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (LLCB) closed on lot sales representing 121 residential units and we recorded equity in earnings of investments of $5.1 million for fiscal year 2023.\nOn December 1, 2023, we announced the commencement of a strategic review process to explore potential alternatives aimed at maximizing stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives could include, but not be limited to, a sale of all or parts of the Company and its assets, a merger or other transaction. The Board has not set a timetable for completion of the review and no transaction or other outcome is guaranteed to take place. At this time, we cannot predict the impact that such strategic alternatives might have on our business, operations or financial condition.\nOn December 19, 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share to be paid on January 12, 2024, in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.3 million to stockholders of record as of January 2, 2024.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the industries and markets in which we conduct business. In particular, the United States lemon market saw a significant decline in volume, with lemon demand falling since widespread shelter in place orders were issued in March 2020, resulting in a significant market oversupply. The export market for fresh produce also significantly declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts.\nThe decline in demand for our products beginning the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 has negatively impacted our sales and profitability for the last four fiscal years. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be estimated at this time, as they are influenced by a number of factors, many of which are outside managements control, including, but not limited, to those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business Approach\nWe cannot assure you that our evaluation of potential strategic alternatives to enhance value for stockholders will be successful; and there may be negative impacts on our business and stock price as a result of the process of exploring strategic alternatives.\nOn December 1, 2023, the Company announced the commencement of a process to explore strategic alternatives, which could include, but not be limited to, a sale of all or parts of the Company, merger or other transaction. The Board has not set a timetable for the completion of this review process and there can be no assurance that it will result in any transaction or outcome. Whether the process will result in any additional transactions, our ability to complete any transaction, and if our Board decides to pursue one or more transactions, will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. Such factors include the interest of potential acquirers or strategic partners in a potential transaction, the value potential acquirers or strategic partners attribute to our businesses and their respective prospects, market conditions, interest rates and industry trends.\nOur stock price may be adversely affected if the evaluation does not result in additional transactions or if one or more transactions are consummated on terms that investors view as unfavorable to us. Even if one or more additional transactions are completed, there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be successful or have a positive effect on stockholder value. Our Board may also determine that no additional transaction is in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected by the strategic process and by the uncertainty regarding its outcome.\nThe attention of management and our Board could be diverted from our core business operations. We have diverted capital and other resources to the process that otherwise could have been used in our business operations, and we will continue to do so until the process is completed.\nWe could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives, including those related to employee retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay and legal, accounting and financial advisor fees. In addition, the process could lead us to lose or fail to attract, retain and motivate key employees, and to lose or fail to attract customers or business partners. Furthermore, it could expose us to litigation. The public announcement of a strategic alternative may also yield a negative impact on operating results if prospective or existing service providers are reluctant to commit to new or renewal contracts or if existing customers decide to move their business to a competitor.\nWe do not intend to disclose developments or provide updates on the progress or status of the strategic process until our Board deems further disclosure is appropriate or required. Accordingly, speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the future of the Company could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Agribusiness Operations\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, including earthquakes and wildfires, and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nFresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. We purchase crop insurance for certain crops which partially mitigates our exposure.\nAll of our crops are subject to damage from frosts and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the past. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of our agricultural plantings and our corporate headquarters are located in a region of California that is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and wildfires. For example, in December 2017, high winds and the related Southern California wildfires caused a brief power outage at our Santa Paula, California packinghouse and destroyed 14 of our farm worker housing units. While our orchards did not suffer significant damage in the wildfire, the potential for significant damage to a substantial amount of our plantings from a natural disaster in the future continues to exist. Furthermore, if a natural disaster or other event occurs that prevents us from using all or a significant portion of our corporate headquarters, as a result of a power outage or otherwise, or that damages critical infrastructure, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial amount of time.\nFor the foregoing reasons, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, including earthquakes and wildfires, or other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur agricultural plantings are potentially subject to damage from disease and pests, which could impose losses on our business and the prevention of which could impose significant additional costs on us.\nFresh produce is vulnerable to crop disease and to pests (e.g., Mediterranean Fruit Fly and the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP)), which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions.\nACP is an aphid-like insect that is a serious pest to all citrus plants because it can transmit the disease Huanglongbing (HLB) when it feeds on the plants' leaves and trees. ACP is a federal action quarantine pest subject to interstate and international quarantine restrictions by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), including a prohibition on the movement of nursery stock out of quarantine areas and a requirement that all citrus fruit be cleaned of leaves and stems prior to movement out of the quarantine area. Due to the discovery of ACP in our orchards, we have experienced costs related to the quarantine and treatment of ACP.\nIn September 2023, two HLB-positive citrus trees were detected on one residential property in the City of Santa Paula, California. In October 2023, the California Department of Food and Agriculture declared a mandatory five-mile-radius quarantine area, which includes approximately 1,100 acres of Limoneira-owned lemon orchards. The quarantine area restricts the movement of citrus fruit, trees and related plant material subject to certain protocols. Additional costs to spray insecticides on our orchards within the quarantine area are estimated to be $0.3 million to $0.4 million in fiscal year 2024. There can be no assurance that HLB will not be detected on Limoneira orchards in the future.\nThe costs to control these diseases and other infestations vary depending on the severity of the damage and the extent of the plantings affected. Moreover, there can be no assurance that available technologies to control such infestations will continue to be effective. These infestations can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategy of marketing and selling our lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers may not continue to be successful.\nDirectly obtaining and retaining customers, particularly chain stores and other large customers, is highly competitive, and the prices or other terms of our sales arrangements may not be sufficient to retain existing business, maintain current levels of profitability or obtain new business. Industry consolidation (horizontally and vertically) and other factors have increased the buying leverage of the major grocery retailers in our markets, which may put further downward pressure on our pricing and volume and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.\nExcess supply often causes severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product. The COVID-19 pandemic also reduced the demand for our products resulting in excess supply.\nFresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Some items, such as avocados and oranges, must be sold more quickly, while other items, such as lemons, can be held in cold storage for longer periods of time. The selling price received for each type of produce depends on all of these factors, including the availability and quality of the produce item in the market and the availability and quality of competing types of produce.\nIn addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. However, even if market prices are unfavorable, produce items which are ready to be, or have been, harvested must be brought to market promptly. A decrease in the selling price received for our products due to the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings may be subject to seasonal variability.\nOur earnings may be affected by seasonal factors, including:\nthe seasonality of our supplies and consumer demand;\nthe ability to process products during critical harvest periods; and\nthe timing and effects of ripening and perishability.\nIncreases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and paper, could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany factors may affect the cost and supply of fresh produce, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for purchased fruit have negatively impacted our operating results in the past, and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nThe price of various commodities can significantly affect our costs. The cost of petroleum-based products is volatile and there can be no assurance that there will not be further increases in such costs in the future. If the price of oil rises, the costs of our herbicides and pesticides can be significantly impacted.\nThe cost of paper is also significant to us because some of our products are packed in cardboard boxes for shipment. If the price of paper increases and we are not able to effectively pass these price increases along to our customers, then our operating income will decrease. Increased costs for paper have negatively impacted our operating income in the past, and there can be no assurance that these increased costs will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nIncreases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe primarily utilize labor contractors to grow, harvest and deliver our fruit to our lemon packinghouse or outside packing facilities. We utilize a combination of employees and labor contractors to process our lemons in our lemon packing facility. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor could delay our harvesting or lemon processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.\nOur labor contractors and we are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. For example, the State of California, where a substantial number of our labor contractors are located, passed regulations that increased minimum wage rates from $15.00 per hour to $15.50 per hour, effective January 1, 2023, and will increase to $16.00 per hour in 2024 due to a cost-of-living increase provision found in the state's minimum wage law. The State of Arizona wage rates rise each year based on the annual cost of living and increased from $12.80 per hour to $13.85 per hour, effective January 1, 2023, and will increase to $14.35 per hour in 2024. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.\nChanges in immigration laws could impact the ability of Limoneira to harvest its crops.\nWe engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in U.S. immigration laws. The states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the U.S. Congress and the Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider and may implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Immigration laws have recently been an area of considerable focus by the Department of Homeland Security, with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who are found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested, which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe lack of sufficient water would severely impact our ability to produce crops or develop real estate.\nThe average rainfall in Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties in California is substantially below amounts required to grow crops and therefore we are dependent on our surface water rights and rights to pump water from underground aquifers. Extended periods of drought in California may put additional pressure on the use and availability of water for agricultural uses, and in some cases, governmental authorities have diverted water to other uses. As California has grown in population, there are increasing and multiple pressures on the use and distribution of water, which many view as a finite resource. Lack of available potable water can also limit real estate development.\nOur water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We use federal project water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the YMIDD. We also have acquired water rights in Chile.\nCalifornia experienced above average precipitation during the 2022 - 2023 rainfall season after experiencing three years of below average precipitation and drought conditions. The above average precipitation helped to alleviate the drought conditions in California. As of October 31, 2023, the state was free from moderate drought conditions and Ventura County was free from any drought conditions. We continue to assess the impact drought conditions may have on our California orchards.\nIn August 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (the Bureau) declared a Level 1 shortage condition at Lake Mead in the Lower Colorado River Basin for the first time ever, requiring shortage reductions and water savings contributions for states in the southwest. In August 2022, the Bureau announced Lake Mead to operate in a Tier 2 shortage, which further increased water restrictions. As a result, in January 2023, Arizona forfeited approximately 21% of the state's yearly allotment of water from Lake Mead. In August 2023, the Bureau announced Lake Mead will operate in a Tier 1 shortage in 2024, which requires Arizona to forfeit approximately 18% of the state's yearly allotment of water from Lake Mead. In response to these water shortages, we entered into fallowing agreements during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and continue to assess the impact these reductions may have on our Arizona orchards.\nFor fiscal year 2023, irrigation costs for our agricultural operations were higher than fiscal year 2022. Costs may increase as we pump more water than our historical averages and federal, state and local water delivery infrastructure costs may increase to access these limited water supplies. We have an ongoing plan for irrigation improvements continuing in fiscal year 2024 that includes drilling new wells and upgrading existing wells and irrigation systems.\nWe believe we have access to adequate supplies of water for our agricultural operations as well as our real estate development and rental operations and currently do not anticipate that future drought conditions will have a material impact on our operating results. However, if future drought conditions are worse than prior drought conditions or if regulatory responses to such conditions limit our access to water, our business could be negatively impacted by these conditions and responses in terms of access to water and/or cost of water.\nThe use of herbicides, pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances in our operations may lead to environmental damage and result in increased costs to us.\nWe use herbicides, pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances in the operation of our business. We may have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, payment of such costs or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental and other regulation of our business, including potential climate change regulation, could adversely impact us by increasing our production cost or restricting our ability to import certain products into the United States.\nOur business depends on the use of fertilizers, pesticides and other agricultural products. The use and disposal of these products in some jurisdictions are subject to regulation by various agencies. A decision by a regulatory agency to significantly restrict the use of such products that have traditionally been used in the cultivation of one of our principal products could have an adverse impact on us. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the EPA is undertaking a series of regulatory actions relating to the evaluation and use of pesticides in the food industry. Similarly, in the EU, regulation (EC) No. 1107/2009 fundamentally changed the pesticide approval process to hazard criteria based on the intrinsic properties of the substance. These actions and future actions regarding the availability and use of pesticides could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, if a regulatory agency were to determine that we are not in compliance with a regulation in that agencys jurisdiction, this could result in substantial penalties and a ban on the sale of part or all of our products in that jurisdiction.\nA global economic downturn may have an adverse impact on participants in our industry, which cannot be fully predicted.\nThe full impact of a global economic downturn on customers, vendors and other business partners, such as that seen with the COVID-19 pandemic, cannot be anticipated. For example, major customers or vendors may have financial challenges unrelated to us that could result in a decrease in their business with us or, in extreme cases, cause them to file for bankruptcy protection. Similarly, parties to contracts may be forced to breach their obligations under those contracts. Although we exercise prudent oversight of the credit ratings and financial strength of our major business partners and seek to diversify our risk to any single business partner, there can be no assurance that there will not be a bank, insurance company, supplier, customer or other financial partner that is unable to meet its contractual commitments to us. Similarly, stresses and pressures in the industry may result in impacts on our business partners and competitors, which could have wide-ranging impacts on the future of the industry.\nWe are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.\nThe sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance, however we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.\nWe are subject to transportation risks.\nAn extended interruption in our ability to ship our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products or supply chain issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nEvents or rumors relating to LIMONEIRA or our other trademarks and related brands could significantly impact our business.\nConsumer and institutional recognition of the LIMONEIRA, One World of Citrus\u00ae, Santa\u00ae, Paula\u00ae, Bridal Veil\u00ae, Fountain\u00ae, Golden Bowl\u00ae, Level\u00ae, Kiva\u00ae, Kachina\u00ae, Oxnard Lemon and Trapani Fresh trademarks and related brands and the association of these brands with high quality and safe food products are an integral part of our business. The occurrence of any events or rumors that cause consumers and/or institutions to no longer associate these brands with high quality and safe food products may materially adversely affect the value of our brand names and demand for our products.\nGovernment regulation could increase our costs of production and increase legal and regulatory expenses.\nGrowing, packaging, storing and distributing food products are activities subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation, as well as foreign regulation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA), the USDA and various state and local public health and agricultural agencies regulate these aspects of our operations. Our business is subject to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act to ensure food safety. This Act provides direct recall authority to the FDA and includes a number of other provisions designed to enhance food safety, including increased inspections by the FDA of food facilities. The Federal Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, which specifies standards for the sale, shipment, inspection and rejection of agricultural products, governs our relationships with our fresh food suppliers with respect to the grading and commercial acceptance of product shipments. Import and export controls and similar laws and regulations, in both the United States and elsewhere affect our business. Issues such as health and safety, which may slow or otherwise restrict imports and exports, could adversely affect our business. In addition, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the way that we have historically operated our business.\nOur strategy to expand international supply and marketing may not be successful and may subject us to risks associated with doing business in corrupt environments.\nWhile we intend to expand our lemon supply sources to international markets and explore opportunities to expand our marketing of lemons, we may not be successful in implementing this strategy. Additionally, in many countries outside of the United States, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our infrastructure to have sufficient capacity to handle our annual lemon production needs.\nWe have an infrastructure that has sufficient capacity for our lemon production needs, but if we lose machinery or facilities due to natural disasters or mechanical failure, we may not be able to operate at a sufficient capacity to meet our lemon production needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nTo service our debt, we require a certain amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others:\neconomic and competitive conditions;\nchanges in laws and regulations;\noperating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and\ndelays in implementing any strategic projects.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks.\nOur revolving and non-revolving credit and term loan facilities contain various restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions. In particular, these agreements limit our ability to, among other things:\nincur additional indebtedness;\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\ncreate certain liens on our assets;\nengage in certain types of transactions with affiliates;\nmerge, consolidate or transfer substantially all our assets; and\ntransfer and sell assets.\nOur revolving and non-revolving credit facility with the AgWest Farm Credit Facility contain a financial covenant that requires us to maintain compliance with a specific debt service coverage ratio on an annual basis. In September 2023, Farm Credit West, PCA (the Lender) modified the covenant to defer measurement as of October 31, 2023 and resume a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.0 measured as of October 31, 2024. Our failure to comply with this covenant in the future may result in the declaration of an event of default under our AgWest Farm Credit Facility.\nAny or all of these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. Any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those imposed under our line of credit and term loan facilities. A breach of a covenant or other provision in any credit facility governing our current and future indebtedness could result in a default under that facility and, due to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, could result in a default under our other credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities, the applicable lender(s) could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and, with respect to our revolving credit facility, terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under our current or future indebtedness were to accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels and the restrictive covenants set forth in agreements governing our indebtedness, we may still incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured and guaranteed indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our overall indebtedness.\nSubject to the restrictions in our credit facilities, we may incur significant additional indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase.\nIn January 2018, LLCB entered into a $45.0 million unsecured Line of Credit Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the Loan) with Bank of America, N.A. to fund early development activities. Effective as of February 22, 2023, the Loan maturity date was extended to February 22, 2024, and the maximum borrowing amount was reduced to $35.0 million. The Loan contains certain customary default provisions and LLCB may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Loan without penalty. The obligations under the Loan are guaranteed by certain principals from Lewis and us. Defaults by LLCB could increase our indebtedness.\nSome of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.\nOur AgWest Farm Credit Facility is subject to variable rates, which generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lender will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our AgWest Farm Credit Facility, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our Companys debt agreement with AgWest Farm Credit used LIBOR as a reference rate, which was converted to the Secure Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) on January 1, 2023.\nGlobal capital and credit market issues affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs and may affect the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nThe global capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption over the past several years, making it more difficult for companies to access those markets. We depend in part on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.\nRisks Related to Our Real Estate Development Operations\nWe are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nThe real estate development industry is cyclical and is affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, including:\nemployment levels;\navailability of financing;\ninterest rates;\nconsumer confidence;\ndemand for the developed product, whether residential or industrial;\nsupply of similar product, whether residential or industrial; and\nlocal, state and federal government regulation, including eminent domain laws, which may result in taking for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth.\nThe process of project development and the commitment of financial and other resources occur long before a real estate project comes to market. A real estate project could come to market at a time when the real estate market is depressed. It is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected.\nA recession in the global economy, or a downturn in national or regional economic conditions, could adversely impact our real estate development business.\nFuture economic instability or tightening in the credit markets could lead to another housing market collapse, which could adversely affect our real estate development operations and those of our equity method investments. Future real estate sales, revenues, financial condition, results of operations and equity in earnings of investments could suffer as a result. Our business is sensitive to economic conditions in California, where our real estate development properties are located.\nHigher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry.\nHigher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing, which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential, commercial or industrial sites. Any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments. In 2023 and 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System took actions in tightening the monetary policy that resulted in higher interest rates prevailing in the marketplace. Market interest rates may continue to increase in the future and the increase may materially and negatively affect us. Lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand. Any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development, which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing.\nWe are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals for our developments that could be denied.\nIn planning and developing our land, we are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, infrastructure design, subdivision of land and construction. All of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations, so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied. In addition, the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area, which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project. In addition, in the past, many states, cities and counties (including Ventura County) have approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures.\nIf unforeseen regulatory challenges with East Areas I and II occur, we may not be able to develop these projects as planned.\nThird-party litigation could increase the time and cost of our real estate development efforts.\nThe land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex. Moreover, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals. As a result, the prospect of third-party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements. Third-party challenges in the form of litigation would, by their nature, adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our real estate development efforts or preclude such development entirely.\nEnvironmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the sites location and condition, the present and former uses of the site, and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species. Environmental laws and conditions may (i) result in delays, (ii) cause us to incur additional costs for compliance, mitigation and processing land use applications, or (iii) preclude development in specific areas. In addition, in California, third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project, which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project. While we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects, certain groups opposed to development may oppose our projects vigorously, so litigation challenging their approval could occur. Recent concerns over the impact of development on water availability and global warming increases the breadth of potential obstacles that our developments face.\nOur real estate development projects are concentrated entirely in California.\nAll of our real estate development projects are located in California, and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within California. Any adverse change in the economic climate of California, and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of California or Ventura County, could adversely affect our real estate development activities. Ultimately, our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations.\nIf the real estate industry weakens or instability of the mortgage industry and commercial real estate financing exists, it could have an adverse effect on our real estate activities.\nIf the residential real estate market weakens or instability of the mortgage industry and commercial real estate financing exists, our residential real estate business could be adversely affected. An excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in house prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with third-party advisors to assist us in carrying out our real estate development projects and are subject to risks associated with such arrangements.\nWe utilize third-party contractor and consultant arrangements to assist us in operating our real estate development division. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing direct control over this business division. For example, our third-party advisors could fail to take actions required for our real estate development businesses despite their contractual obligation to do so. If the third-party advisors fail to perform under their agreements with us, we may have to rely on legal remedies under the law, which may not be effective. In addition, we cannot assure you that our third-party advisors would always act in our best interests.\nIf we are unable to complete land development projects within forecasted time and budget expectations, if at all, our financial results may be negatively affected.\nWe intend to develop land and real estate properties as suitable opportunities arise, taking into consideration the general economic climate. New real estate development projects have a number of risks, including the following:\nconstruction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs;\nreceipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;\ndevelopment costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion;\nearthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires or other natural disasters that could adversely affect a project;\ndefects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation;\nour ability to raise capital;\nthe impact of governmental assessments such as park fees or affordable housing requirements;\ngovernmental restrictions on the nature and size of a project or timing of completion; and\nthe potential lack of adequate building/construction capacity for large development projects.\nIf any development project is not completed on time or within budget, our financial results may be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nThe financial performance of our real estate development activities is closely related to our success in obtaining land use entitlements for proposed development projects. Obtaining all of the necessary entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. In some situations, we may be unable to obtain the necessary entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter our plans for the development. Delays or failures to obtain these entitlements may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe could experience a reduction in net income or reduced cash flows if we are unable to obtain reasonably priced financing to support our real estate development projects and land development activities.\nThe real estate development industry is capital intensive, and development requires significant up-front expenditures to develop land and begin real estate construction. Accordingly, we have and may continue to incur substantial indebtedness to finance our real estate development and land development activities. Although we believe that internally generated funds and current and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our capital and other expenditures, including additional land acquisition, development and construction activities, and the amounts available from such sources, may not be adequate to meet our needs. If such sources were insufficient, we would seek additional capital in the form of debt from a variety of potential sources, including bank financing. The availability of borrowed funds to be used for additional land acquisition, development and construction may be greatly reduced, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with new loans. The failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and our results of operations in future periods.\nWe may encounter risks associated with the real estate joint ventures we entered into in November 2015 and October 2022 with the Lewis Group of Companies including:\nthe joint ventures may not perform financially or operationally as expected;\nland values, project costs, sales absorption or other assumptions included in the development plans may cause the joint ventures operating results to be less than expected;\nthe joint ventures may not be able to obtain project loans on acceptable terms;\nthe joint venture partners may not be able to provide capital to the joint ventures in the event external financing or project cash flows are not sufficient to finance the joint ventures operations;\nthe joint venture partners may not manage the project properly; and\ndisagreements could occur between the joint venture partners that could affect the operating results of the joint ventures or could result in a sale of a partners interest or the joint ventures at undesirable values.\nWe may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land.\nWe may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land, including:\nnatural risks, such as geological and soil problems, earthquakes, fire, heavy rains and flooding and heavy winds;\nshortages of qualified trades people;\nreliance on local contractors, who may be inadequately capitalized;\nshortages of materials;\nincreases in the cost of certain materials; and\nenvironmental remediation costs.\nGeneral Risks and Risks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur business is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.\nMany companies compete in our different businesses. However, only a few well-established companies operate on an international, national and regional basis with one or several product lines. We face strong competition from these and other companies in all our product lines.\nImportant factors with respect to our competitors include the following:\nSome of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry or to introduce new products and packaging more quickly and with greater marketing support.\nWe cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.\nCurrency exchange fluctuation may impact the results of our operations.\nWe distribute our products both nationally and internationally. Our international sales are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars. Our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates in both sourcing and selling locations. In the past, periods of a strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies have led international customers, particularly in Asia, to find alternative sources of fruit.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nWe currently depend heavily on the services of our key management personnel. The loss of any key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel.\nInflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nInflation can have a major impact on our agribusiness operations. The farming operations are most affected by escalating costs, unpredictable revenues (due to an oversupply of certain crops) and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue and we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nComputer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, packing, distribution or other critical functions.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nThe acquisition of other businesses could pose risks to our operating income.\nWe intend to continue to consider acquisition prospects that complement our business. While we are not currently a party to any agreement with respect to any acquisitions, we may acquire other businesses in the future. Future acquisitions by us could result in accounting charges, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, and increased debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the integration of the acquired operations, diversion of managements attention to other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience, and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations. We may be unable to successfully integrate businesses or the personnel of any business that might be acquired in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock.\nThe value of our common stock could be volatile.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. There are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. The risks described here are not the only ones we will face. If any of these risks or other risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe overall market and the price of our common stock may fluctuate greatly and we cannot assure you that you will be able to resell shares at or above market price. The trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, including:\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results;\nchanges in investors and analysts perception of the business risks and conditions of our business;\nour ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of financial analysts or investors;\nunfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts;\nfluctuations in the stock prices of our peer companies or in stock markets in general; and\ngeneral economic or political conditions.\nConcentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price.\nAs of October 31, 2023, directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately 3.3% of our common stock. Investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock. The sale by any of our large stockholders of a significant portion of that stockholders holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly.\nOur charter documents contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. These provisions include the following:\ndivision of our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;\nremoval of directors by stockholders by a supermajority of two-thirds of the outstanding shares;\nability of the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock in series without stockholder approval; and\nprohibitions on our stockholders that prevent them from acting by written consent and limitations on calling special meetings.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ, require us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nReal Estate\nWe own our corporate headquarters in Santa Paula, California. We own approximately 4,300 acres of farm land in California, 1,300 acres in Yuma, Arizona, 3,500 acres in La Serena, Chile and 1,200 acres in Jujuy, Argentina. We also lease approximately 100 acres of land and have an interest in a partnership that owns approximately 200 acres of land. The land used for agricultural plantings consists of approximately 3,500 acres of lemons, approximately 1,200 acres of avocados, approximately 100 acres of oranges and approximately 400 acres of other crops. We believe that our properties are generally suitable to meet our production needs for the foreseeable future. Our agribusiness land holdings are summarized below as of October 31, 2023 ($ in thousands):\nRanch Name Acres Book Value Acquisition Date Book Value\nper Acre\nLimoneira/Olivelands Ranch 1,700 $ 767 1907, 1913, 1920 $ 451\nLa Campana Ranch 300 758 1964 $ 2,527\nOrchard Farm Ranch 1,100 3,240 1990 $ 2,945\nRancho La Cuesta Ranch 200 2,899 1994 $ 14,495\nWindfall Farms 700 16,162 2009 $ 23,089\nAssociated Citrus Packers 1,300 14,500 2013 $ 11,154\nPan de Azucar 200 2,395 2017 $ 11,975\nSan Pablo 3,300 5,837 2018 $ 1,769\nSanta Clara 1,200 8,600 2019 $ 7,167\nOther agribusiness land 600 574 various $ 957\nTotal agribusiness land holdings 10,600 $ 55,732\nThe book value of our agribusiness land holdings of approximately $55.7 million differs from the land balance of $56.0 million included in property, plant and equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report as the table above excludes land holdings related to our other operations.\nWe own our packing facilities located in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process and pack our lemons as well as lemons for other growers. We have a 5.5 acre, one-megawatt ground-based photovoltaic solar generator and one-megawatt roof array, which provides the majority of the power to operate our packing facility.\nWe own and maintain 238 residential units in Ventura County that we lease to our employees, former employees and outside tenants and we own several commercial office buildings and properties that are leased to various tenants.\nWe own and have equity investments in real estate development property in Ventura County, California. These properties are in various stages of development for up to approximately 800 residential units.\nWater and Mineral Rights\nOur water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. We believe we have adequate supplies of water for our agribusiness segments as well as our rental and real estate development activities. Water for our farming operations located in Ventura County, California is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes approximately 8,600 acre-feet of adjudicated water rights in the Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore Basin (aquifer). Our Windfall Farms property located in San Luis Obispo County, California obtains water from wells that derive water from the Paso Robles Basin (aquifer). Our Associated farming operations in Yuma, Arizona source water from the Colorado River through the YMIDD, where we have access to approximately 11,700 acre-feet of Class 3 Colorado River water rights. We use ground water provided by wells and surface water for our PDA and San Pablo farming operations in La Serena, Chile and our Trapani Fresh farming operations in Argentina.\nOur rights to extract groundwater from the Santa Paula Basin are governed by the Santa Paula Basin Judgment (the Judgment). The Judgment was entered into in 1996 by stipulation among the United Water Conservation District, the City of Ventura and various members of the Santa Paula Basin Pumpers Association (the Association). The Association is a not-for-profit, mutual benefit corporation, which represents the interests of all overlying landowners with rights to extract groundwater from the Santa Paula Basin and the City of Santa Paula. We are a member of the Association and membership is governed by the Association's Bylaws.\nOur California water resources include approximately 17,000 acre-feet of water affiliated with our owned properties, of which approximately 8,600 acre-feet are adjudicated. Our Yuma, Arizona water resources include approximately 11,700 acre-feet of water sourced from the Colorado River. We own shares in various not-for-profit mutual benefit water companies. Our investments in these water companies provide us with the right to receive a proportionate share of water from each of the water companies.\nWe believe water is a natural resource that is critical to economic growth in the western United States and firm, reliable water rights are essential to our sustainable business practices. Consequently, we have long been a private steward and advocate of prudent and efficient water management. We have made substantial investments in securing water and water rights in quantities that are sufficient to support and, we believe will exceed, our long-term business objectives. We strive to follow best management practices for the diversion, conveyance, distribution and use of water. In the future, we intend to continue to provide leadership in the area of, and seek innovation opportunities that promote, increased water use efficiency and the development of new sources of supply for our neighboring communities. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various lawsuits, arbitrations or mediations that arise in the ordinary course of business. The disclosure called for by Part II, Item 3 regarding our legal proceedings is incorporated by reference herein from Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Item 6. Reserved Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those presented under Risk Factors included in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section generally discusses the results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 22, 2022.\nOverview\nLimoneira Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor to several businesses with operations in California since 1893. We are primarily an agribusiness company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 11,100 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate and capital investment activities.\nWe have three business divisions: agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development. The agribusiness division is comprised of four reportable operating segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness, which includes oranges, specialty citrus, other crops and farm management services. The agribusiness division includes our core operations of farming, harvesting, lemon packing and lemon sales operations. The rental operations division includes our residential and commercial rentals comprised of 238 completed rental units, leased land operations and organic recycling. The real estate development division includes our investments in real estate development projects. Generally, we see our Company as a land and farming company that generates annual cash flows to support our progress into diversified real estate development activities. As real estate developments are monetized, our agriculture business will then be able to expand more rapidly into new regions and markets.\nRecent Developments - Refer to Part I, Item 1 Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights and Recent Developments\nResults of Operations\nThe following table shows the results of operations ($ in thousands):\nYears Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet revenues:\nAgribusiness $ 174,381 97 % $ 179,281 97 % $ 161,381 97 %\nOther operations 5,520 3 % 5,324 3 % 4,646 3 %\nTotal net revenues 179,901 100 % 184,605 100 % 166,027 100 %\nCosts and expenses:\nAgribusiness 169,169 99 % 160,651 88 % 148,492 86 %\nOther operations 4,612 3 % 4,438 2 % 4,332 3 %\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net (28,849) (17) % (4,500) (2) % 109 - %\nGain on legal settlement (2,269) (1) % - - % - - %\nSelling, general and administrative 26,455 16 % 21,815 12 % 19,427 11 %\nTotal costs and expenses 169,118 100 % 182,404 100 % 172,360 100 %\nOperating income (loss):\nAgribusiness 5,212 18,630 12,889\nOther operations 908 886 314\nGain (loss) on disposal of assets, net 28,849 4,500 (109)\nGain on legal settlement 2,269 - -\nSelling, general and administrative (26,455) (21,815) (19,427)\nOperating income (loss) 10,783 2,201 (6,333)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income 364 53 379\nInterest expense, net of patronage dividends (494) (2,291) (1,501)\nEquity in earnings of investments, net 5,322 1,341 3,203\nOther (expense) income, net (2,611) (955) 89\nTotal other income (expense) 2,581 (1,852) 2,170\nIncome (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit 13,364 349 (4,163)\nIncome tax (provision) benefit (4,247) (823) 266\nNet income (loss) 9,117 (474) (3,897)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 283 238 456\nNet income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company $ 9,400 $ (236) $ (3,441)\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDue to significant depreciable assets associated with the nature of our operations and interest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes stock-based compensation, named executive officer cash severance, pension settlement cost, (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net, cash bonus related to sale of assets and gain on legal settlement are important measures to evaluate our results of operations between periods on a more comparable basis. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2021 did not exclude stock-based compensation which has now been excluded as management believes this is a better representation of cash generated by operations and is consistent with peer company reporting. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2021 has been restated to conform to the current presentation. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to us and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are summarized and reconciled to net income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company which management considers to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) attributable to Limoneira Company $ 9,400 $ (236) $ (3,441)\nInterest income (364) (53) (379)\nInterest expense, net of patronage dividends 494 2,291 1,501\nIncome tax provision (benefit) 4,247 823 (266)\nDepreciation and amortization 8,576 9,798 9,812\nEBITDA $ 22,353 $ 12,623 $ 7,227\nStock-based compensation 3,841 2,732 2,582\nNamed executive officer cash severance - 432 -\nPension settlement cost 2,700 607 -\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net (28,849) (4,500) 109\nCash bonus related to sale of assets 2,000 - -\nGain on legal settlement (2,269) - -\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (224) $ 11,894 $ 9,918\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022\nRevenues\nTotal net revenues for fiscal year 2023 were $179.9 million compared to $184.6 million for fiscal year 2022. The 3% decrease of $4.7 million was primarily due to decreased avocados and oranges agribusiness revenues, partially offset by farm management agribusiness revenues, as detailed below (in thousands):\nYears Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 Change\nLemons $ 142,110 $ 143,061 $ (951) (1)%\nAvocados 7,046 17,331 (10,285) (59)%\nOranges 5,779 9,911 (4,132) (42)%\nSpecialty citrus and other crops 9,515 8,978 537 6%\nFarm management 9,931 - 9,931 -%\nAgribusiness revenues $ 174,381 $ 179,281 $ (4,900) (3)%\nLemons: The decrease in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to decreased fresh lemon sales, partially offset by increased brokered lemons and other lemon sales. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, fresh lemon sales were $86.8 million and $92.9 million, in aggregate, on 4.8 million and 4.9 million cartons of lemons sold at average per carton prices of $18.24 and $18.77, respectively. Lemon revenues in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included brokered lemons and other lemon sales of $30.3 million and $24.5 million, shipping and handling of $20.6 million and $22.2 million, and lemon by-product sales of $3.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively. In addition, lemon revenues included settlement proceeds of $1.4 million allocated to lemons in fiscal year 2023.\nAvocados: The decrease in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to decreased volume and lower prices of avocados sold. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, 3.8 million and 8.2 million pounds of avocados were sold at an average per pound price of $1.06 and $2.08, respectively. The California avocado crop typically experiences alternating years of high and low production due to plant physiology. In addition, avocado revenues included settlement proceeds of $2.4 million allocated to avocados and crop insurance proceeds of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2023.\nOranges: The decrease in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to decreased volume, mainly related to the Northern Properties sale. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, 292,000 and 676,000 cartons of oranges were sold at an average per carton price of $19.79 and $14.66, respectively.\nSpecialty citrus and other crops: The increase in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to higher prices, partially offset by decreased volume of specialty citrus sold. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we sold 240,000 and 434,000 40-pound carton equivalents of specialty citrus at an average per carton price of $27.18 and $13.22, respectively. Additionally, during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we sold $2.9 million and $3.2 million of wine grapes, respectively.\nFarm management: Farm management revenues in fiscal year 2023 were $9.9 million, primarily due to the Northern Properties farming, management and operations services. There were no farm management revenues in fiscal year 2022.\nOther operations revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was $5.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to increased leased land revenue.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur total costs and expenses in fiscal year 2023 were $169.1 million, compared to $182.4 million in the same period of fiscal year 2022. The 7% decrease of $13.3 million was primarily due to increased gain on disposal of assets, mainly related to the Northern Properties sale, partially offset by the loss on disposal of Cadiz Ranch assets and increased agribusiness costs and expenses. Agribusiness costs and expenses are detailed below (in thousands):\nYears Ended October 31,\n2023 2022 Change\nPacking costs $ 48,581 $ 45,448 $ 3,133 7%\nHarvest costs 18,613 20,767 (2,154) (10)%\nGrowing costs 33,379 26,277 7,102 27%\nThird-party grower and supplier costs 61,273 59,555 1,718 3%\nDepreciation and amortization 7,323 8,604 (1,281) (15)%\nAgribusiness costs and expenses $ 169,169 $ 160,651 $ 8,518 5%\nPacking costs: Packing costs consist primarily of the costs to pack lemons for sale such as labor and benefits, cardboard cartons, fruit treatments, packing and shipping supplies and facility operating costs. In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, lemon packing costs were $45.7 million and $43.0 million, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to higher average per carton costs, partially offset by decreased volume of fresh lemons packed and sold compared to fiscal year 2022. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we packed and sold 4.8 million and 4.9 million cartons of lemons at average per carton costs of $9.61 and $8.69, respectively. The increase in average per carton costs in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs. Additionally, in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, packing costs included $2.9 million and $2.4 million of shipping costs, respectively.\nHarvest costs: The decrease in harvest costs in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to decreased volume of avocados, oranges and specialty citrus harvested, partially offset by increased volume of lemons harvested.\nGrowing costs: Growing costs, also referred to as cultural costs, consist of orchard maintenance costs such as cultivation, fertilization and soil amendments, pest control, pruning and irrigation. The increase in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to the Northern Properties farm management costs which were expensed in fiscal year 2023 and were capitalized as cultural costs in fiscal year 2022, as well as farm management decisions based on weather, harvest timing and crop conditions.\nThird-party grower and supplier costs: We sell fruit that we grow and fruit that we procure from other growers and suppliers. The cost of procuring fruit from other growers and suppliers as well as the cost of brokered fruit is referred to as third-party grower and supplier costs. The increase in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to increased costs incurred for brokered fruit, partially offset by decreased costs for third-party growers and suppliers' fruit. In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we incurred costs for purchased, packed fruit for resale of $29.4 million and $26.2 million, respectively. In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we incurred costs for third-party growers and suppliers' fruit of $31.9 million and $33.4 million, respectively. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022 of the 4.8 million and 4.9 million cartons of lemons packed and sold, 2.6 million (54%) and 2.6 million (52%), were procured from third-party growers and suppliers at average per carton prices of $12.44 and $13.03, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was $7.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The decrease in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, was primarily due to the Northern Properties sale in fiscal year 2023.\nOther operations expenses for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were $4.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nGain on disposal of assets, net in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were $28.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. The change is primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Northern Properties, partially offset by the loss on disposal of Cadiz Ranch assets in fiscal year 2023.\nGain on legal settlement was $2.3 million in fiscal year 2023 due to the Settlement Agreement related to the Thomas fire.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2023 were $26.5 million compared to $21.8 million for fiscal year 2022. The $4.7 million increase was primarily due to:\n$2.5 million net increase in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation;\n$0.7 million increase in tax, legal and consulting fees primarily related to disposals of Northern Properties and Cadiz;\n$0.2 million increase in selling expenses; and\n$1.3 million net increase in other selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily associated with our strategic initiatives.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other income (expense) was $2.6 million and $(1.9) million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $4.4 million increase in total other income was primarily due to:\n$4.0 million increase of equity earnings in investments primarily due to LLCB;\n$1.8 million decrease of interest expense due to decreased long-term debt; and\n$1.7 million increase of other expense primarily due to pension settlement cost.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 income tax provision of $4.2 million and $0.8 million on pre-tax income of $13.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% due primarily to foreign jurisdictions which are taxed at different rates, state taxes, tax impact of stock-based compensation, nondeductible tax items and valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 31.8% and 234.8%, respectively.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest represents 10% and 49% of the net loss of PDA and Trapani Fresh, respectively, for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe operate in four reportable operating segments: fresh lemons, lemon packing, avocados and other agribusiness. Our reportable operating segments are strategic business units with different products and services, distribution processes and customer bases. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results. Each segment is subject to review and evaluations related to current market conditions, market opportunities and available resources. See Note 21 - Segment Information for additional information regarding our operating segments.\nSegment information for fiscal year 2023 (in thousands):\nFresh\nLemons Lemon\nPacking Eliminations\nAvocados Other\nAgribusiness Total\nAgribusiness Corporate\nand Other Total\nRevenues from external customers $ 121,537 $ 20,573 $ - $ 7,046 $ 25,225 $ 174,381 $ 5,520 $ 179,901\nIntersegment revenue - 31,081 (31,081) - - - - -\nTotal net revenues 121,537 51,654 (31,081) 7,046 25,225 174,381 5,520 179,901\nCosts and expenses (gain) 120,494 45,689 (31,081) 4,034 22,710 161,846 (1,304) 160,542\nDepreciation and amortization - - - - - 7,323 1,253 8,576\nOperating income $ 1,043 $ 5,965 $ - $ 3,012 $ 2,515 $ 5,212 $ 5,571 $ 10,783\nSegment information for fiscal year 2022 (in thousands):\nFresh\nLemons Lemon\nPacking Eliminations\nAvocados Other\nAgribusiness Total\nAgribusiness Corporate\nand Other Total\nRevenues from external customers $ 120,885 $ 22,176 $ - $ 17,331 $ 18,889 $ 179,281 $ 5,324 $ 184,605\nIntersegment revenue - 29,817 (29,817) - - - - -\nTotal net revenues 120,885 51,993 (29,817) 17,331 18,889 179,281 5,324 184,605\nCosts and expenses 115,119 43,017 (29,817) 5,524 18,204 152,047 20,559 172,606\nDepreciation and amortization - - - - - 8,604 1,194 9,798\nOperating income (loss) $ 5,766 $ 8,976 $ - $ 11,807 $ 685 $ 18,630 $ (16,429) $ 2,201\nFiscal Year 2023 Segment Information Compared to Fiscal Year 2022 Segment Information\nThe following analysis should be read in conjunction with the previous section Results of Operations.\nFresh Lemons\nFresh lemons segment revenue is comprised of sales of fresh lemons, lemon by-products, brokered lemons and other lemon revenue. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, our fresh lemons segment total net revenues were $121.5 million and $120.9 million, respectively. The 1% increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to:\nFresh lemon sales decrease of $6.2 million;\nBrokered lemons and other lemon sales increase of $5.8 million;\nLemon by-products decrease of $0.4 million; and\nLegal settlement proceeds in fiscal year 2023 allocated to fresh lemons of $1.4 million.\nCosts and expenses associated with our fresh lemons segment include growing costs, harvest costs, cost of lemons we procure from third-party growers and suppliers, transportation costs and packing service charges incurred from the lemon packing segment to pack lemons for sale. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, our fresh lemons segment costs and expenses were $120.5 million and $115.1 million, respectively. The 5% increase of $5.4 million was primarily due to:\nHarvest costs increase of $0.3 million;\nGrowing costs increase of $3.2 million;\nThird-party grower and supplier costs increase of $0.1 million;\nTransportation costs increase of $0.5 million; and\nIntersegment costs and expenses increase of $1.3 million.\nLemon Packing\nLemon packing segment revenue is comprised of packing revenue, intersegment packing revenue and shipping and handling revenue. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, our lemon packing segment total net revenues were $51.7 million and $52.0 million, respectively, a 1% decrease of $0.3 million.\nCosts and expenses associated with our lemon packing segment consist of the costs to pack lemons for sale such as labor and benefits, cardboard cartons, fruit treatments, packing and shipping supplies and facility operating costs. For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, our lemon packing costs and expenses were $45.7 million and $43.0 million, respectively. The 6% increase of $2.7 million was primarily due to increased labor and benefit costs.\nLemon packing segment operating income per carton sold was $1.25 and $1.81 for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe lemon packing segment included $31.1 million and $29.8 million of intersegment revenues for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, that were charged to the fresh lemons segment to pack lemons for sale. Such intersegment revenues and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.\nAvocados\nOur avocados segment revenues were $7.0 million and $17.3 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a 59% decrease of $10.3 million, due primarily to alternating years of high and low production due to plant physiology.\nCosts and expenses associated with our avocados segment include growing and harvest costs. Our avocados segment costs and expenses were $4.0 million and $5.5 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 27% decrease of $1.5 million primarily consisted of the following:\nHarvest costs decrease of $0.9 million; and\nGrowing costs decrease of $0.6 million.\nOther Agribusiness\nOur other agribusiness segment total net revenues were $25.2 million and $18.9 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 34% increase of $6.3 million was primarily due to:\nOrange revenues decrease of $4.1 million;\nSpecialty citrus and other revenues increase of $0.5 million; and\nFarm management revenues in fiscal year 2023 were $9.9 million. There were no farm management revenues in fiscal year 2022.\nCosts and expenses associated with our other agribusiness segment include growing costs, harvest costs and purchased fruit costs. Our other agribusiness costs and expenses were $22.7 million and $18.2 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 25% increase of $4.5 million was primarily due to:\nHarvest costs decrease of $1.5 million;\nGrowing costs increase of $4.4 million; and\nPurchased fruit costs increase of $1.6 million.\nTotal agribusiness depreciation and amortization expenses were $7.3 million and $8.6 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCorporate and Other\nOur corporate and other operations revenues were $5.5 million and $5.3 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCosts and expenses (gain) in our corporate and other operations were $(1.3) million and $20.6 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, and include selling, general and administrative costs and expenses, gain on disposal of assets, net and gain on legal settlement not allocated to the operating segments. Depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash flows generated from our operations and use of our revolving credit facility. Our liquidity and capital position fluctuates during the year depending on seasonal production cycles, weather events and demand for our products. Typically, our first and last fiscal quarters coincide with the fall and winter months during which we are growing crops that are harvested and sold in the spring and summer, which are our second and third quarters. To meet working capital demand and investment requirements of our agribusiness and real estate development projects and to supplement operating cash flows, we utilize our revolving credit facility to fund agricultural inputs and farm management practices until sufficient returns from crops allow us to repay amounts borrowed. Raw materials needed to propagate the various crops grown by us consist primarily of fertilizer, herbicides, insecticides, fuel and water, all of which are readily available from local sources.\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business consist primarily of purchase obligations, long-term fixed rate and variable rate debt and related interest payments and operating and finance leases. See Note 11 - Long-Term Debt and Note 13 - Leases for amounts outstanding as of October 31, 2023, related to debt and leases. Purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to packing supplies, the majority of which are due in the next three years.\nWe believe that the cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity from our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditures, debt service, working capital needs and other contractual obligations for the next twelve months. We believe our revenue generating operations, distributions from equity investments and credit facilities will generate sufficient cash needed to operate beyond the next twelve months. In addition, we have the ability to control a portion of our investing cash flows to the extent necessary based on our liquidity demands.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(15.9) million and $14.8 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The significant components of our cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities were as follows:\nNet income (loss) was $9.1 million and $(0.5) million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The components of net income for fiscal year 2023, compared to net loss for fiscal year 2022, consists of an increase in operating income of $8.6 million and an increase in total other income of $4.4 million, offset by an increase in income tax provision of $3.4 million.\nAdjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash (used in) provided by operating activities:\n\u25e6Adjustments (used) provided $(22.5) million and $10.0 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to depreciation and amortization, gain on disposal of assets, stock compensation expense, equity in earnings of investments, net and deferred income taxes.\n\u25e6Changes in operating assets and liabilities (used in) provided by $(2.5) million and $5.3 million of operating cash for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to cultural costs, prepaid expenses/other current assets, accounts payable/growers and suppliers payable, accrued liabilities/payables to related parties, and other long-term liabilities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\u25aaThe $90.6 million of net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2023 was comprised primarily of net proceeds from sales of assets of $98.5 million, net proceeds from the sale of real estate development assets of $2.6 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $10.3 million, primarily related to orchard and vineyard development.\n\u25aaThe $19.4 million of net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2022 was comprised primarily of net proceeds from sale of assets of $19.3 million, net proceeds from the sale of real estate development assets of $7.9 million, collection on notes receivable of $2.8 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $10.1 million related to orchard and vineyard development.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe $71.9 million of net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2023 was comprised primarily of net repayments of long-term debt $65.0 million and common and preferred stock dividends of $5.9 million.\nThe $33.5 million of net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was comprised primarily of net repayments of long-term debt of $26.8 million, common and preferred stock dividends of $5.8 million and the exchange of common stock of $1.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from equipment financings of $1.0 million.\nTransactions Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCredit Facilities and Long-Term Debt\nWe finance our working capital and other liquidity requirements primarily through cash from operations and from our AgWest Farm Credit Facility, which includes the Master Loan Agreement (the MLA) and Supplements. In addition, we have Banco de Chile term loans and COVID-19 loans. Additional information regarding these loans can be found in Note 11- Long-Term Debt.\nIn June 2021, we entered into the MLA with the Lender, together with the Supplements and a Fixed Interest Rate Agreement, which extends the principal repayment to July 1, 2026. The MLA governs the terms of the Supplements.\nThe Supplements provide aggregate borrowing capacity of $115.0 million, comprised of $75.0 million under the Revolving Credit Supplement and $40.0 million under the Non-Revolving Credit Supplement. As of October 31, 2023, our outstanding borrowings under the AgWest Farm Credit Facility were $40.0 million and we had $75.0 million of availability.\nOn January 31, 2023, the Company sold the Northern Properties which resulted in total net proceeds of $98.4 million. The proceeds were used to pay down all of the Company's domestic debt except the Non-Revolving Credit Supplement.\nThe MLA subjects us to affirmative and restrictive covenants including, among other customary covenants, financial reporting requirements, requirements to maintain and repair any collateral, restrictions on the sale of assets, restrictions on the use of proceeds, prohibitions on the incurrence of additional debt and restrictions on the purchase or sale of major assets of our business. We are also subject to a financial covenant that requires us to maintain compliance with a specific debt service coverage ratio on an annual basis. In September 2023, the Lender modified the covenant to defer measurement as of October 31, 2023 and resume a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.0 measured as of October 31, 2024.\nIn fiscal years 2023 and 2022 we received annual patronage dividends of $1.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from the Lender.\nDividends\nThe holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Stock) and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock (the Series B-2 Preferred Stock) are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends. Such preferred dividends paid totaled $0.5 million in each of the fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nCash dividends declared in each of the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 totaled $0.30 per common share and such dividends paid totaled $5.4 million in fiscal year 2023 and $5.3 million in fiscal year 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nIn fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we paid income taxes of $7.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nReal Estate Development Activities and Related Capital Resources\nAs noted under Transactions Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources, we have the ability to control a portion of our investing cash flows to the extent necessary based upon our liquidity demands. In order for our real estate development operations to reach their maximum potential benefit to us, however, we will need to be successful over time in identifying other third-party sources of capital to collaborate with us to move those development projects forward. While we are frequently in discussions with potential external sources of capital in respect to all of our development projects, current market conditions for California real estate projects make it difficult to predict the timing and amounts of future capital that will be required to complete the development of our projects.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a joint venture with Lewis for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed LLCB as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the joint venture and sold a 50% interest in the joint venture to Lewis for $20.0 million. The first phase of the project broke ground to commence mass grading in November 2017. Approved project plans currently include approximately 1,500 residential units and site improvements. A total of 707 residential units have closed from the project's inception to October 31, 2023.\nIn October 2022, we entered into a joint venture with Lewis for the development of our 17-acre East Area I Retained Property. We formed LLCB II as the development entity, contributed our Retained Property to the joint venture and sold a 50% interest to Lewis for approximately $8.0 million. We recorded a gain on the transaction of approximately $4.7 million, of which $0.5 million was deferred.\nThe joint venture partners will share in the capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the projects. Since inception each partner has made funding contributions of $21.4 million to LLCB and $0.5 million to LLCB II. We expect to receive approximately $123.0 million from LLCB, LLCB II and East Area II over the next seven years of the projects.\nTrend Information\nThe commodity pricing for our fresh produce, and therefore our revenues and margins, is significantly impacted by consumer demand. The worldwide fresh produce industry has historically enjoyed consistent underlying demand and favorable growth dynamics. In recent years, the market for fresh produce has increased faster than the rate of population growth, supported by ongoing trends including greater consumer demand for healthy, fresh and convenient foods, increased retailer square footage devoted to fresh produce, and greater emphasis on fresh produce as a differentiating factor in attracting customers. Health-conscious consumers are driving much of the growth in demand for fresh produce. Over the past several decades, the benefits of natural, preservative-free and organic foods have become an increasingly significant element of the public dialogue on health and nutrition. As a result, consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables has markedly increased. Conversely, a decrease in demand, as was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of restaurant closures, has the impact of reducing our pricing and therefore our revenues and margins.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to develop critical accounting policies and make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, available relevant data and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as new or additional information become available in future periods. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nImpairment of Real Estate Development Projects - We evaluate our real estate development projects, held either by us or as included specifically within our investments in LLCB and LLCB II, for impairment on an ongoing basis. Our evaluation for impairment involves an initial assessment of each real estate development project to determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate that the carrying amounts of, or investment in, real estate development projects are no longer recoverable. Possible indications of impairment may include events or changes in circumstances affecting the entitlement process, zoning, government regulation, geographical demand for new housing or commercial property, and market conditions related to residential or commercial land lots. When events or changes in circumstances exist, we further evaluate the real estate development projects for impairment by a) comparing undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the real estate development projects to the respective carrying amount for our real estate development or b) determining if our equity in investment has incurred an other-than-temporary decline.\nWe make significant judgments in evaluating each real estate development project, as held by us or within our investments in LLCB and LLCB II, for possible indications of impairment. These judgments may relate to the identification of appropriate and comparable market prices, the consideration of changes to legal factors or the business climate, the likelihood of successfully completing the entitlement process, changes in zoning or government regulation, and demand for new housing. Changes in these judgments could have a significant impact on real estate development or equity in investments. For fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, no impairment loss has been recognized on any real estate development and no other-than-temporary-impairment has been recognized on our equity in LLCB or LLCB II.\nThe impairment calculation for real estate developments held by us compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted). We recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis. Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations.\nWhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our equity investments in LLCB and LLCB II might not be recoverable, then we determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary. If we conclude the impairment is other-than-temporary, we determine the estimated fair value of the investment by performing a discounted cash flow or market approach analysis and recognize an other-than-temporary impairment to reduce the investment to its estimated fair value.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to impairment of real estate development projects held by us, or other-than-temporary impairment of our equity investments in LLCB and LLCB II, is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period; it requires management to make assumptions about future prices, production, and costs, and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings. Managements assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate development projects or return on equity of our investments in LLCB and LLCB II have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices, production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information concerning recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nBorrowings under the AgWest Farm Credit Facility are subject to variable interest rates. These variable interest rates subject us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with any upward movements in interest rates. For the AgWest Farm Credit Facility, our borrowing interest rate is an internally calculated rate based on an AgWest Farm Credit internal method that follows the changing market interest rates and the cost to fund variable-rate loans. Rate changes are expected to be generally the same as the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) recommended changes, however the changes may be marginally different than the FOMC's recommendation. As of October 31, 2023, our total debt outstanding under the AgWest Farm Credit Facility was $40.0 million.\nBased on our level of borrowings as of October 31, 2023, a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would not materially increase our interest expense for fiscal year 2024 or the three subsequent fiscal years. Additionally, a 100 basis points increase in the interest rate would not materially decrease our net income for fiscal year 2024 or the three subsequent fiscal years. We have strategies in place to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, including the potential early pay down of outstanding debt under the AgWest Farm Credit Facility.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (LLCB), the Company's investment in which is accounted for by use of the equity method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include, before the basis difference and related amortization discussed in Note 7, its equity in investment in LLCB of $58,282,000 and $52,431,000 as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and its equity earnings in LLCB of $5,851,000, $1,015,000, and $4,508,000 for the years ended October 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The financial statements of LLCB were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Companys equity in investment and equity earnings in LLCB, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nReal estate development assets held by the Company and equity in investment in LLCB - Impairment Indicators - Refer to Notes 2, 6 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Companys evaluation of real estate development projects, held either by the Company or as included specifically within its investment in LLCB, for impairment involves an initial assessment of each real estate development project to determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate that the carrying amounts of, or investment in, real estate development projects are no longer recoverable. Possible indications of impairment may include events or changes in circumstances affecting the entitlement process, zoning, government regulation, geographical demand for new housing or commercial property, and market conditions related to residential or commercial land lots. When events or changes in circumstances exist, the Company further evaluates the real estate development projects for impairment by a) comparing undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the real estate development projects to the respective carrying amount for its real estate development or b) determining if its equity in investment has incurred an other-than-temporary decline.\nThe Company makes significant judgments in evaluating each real estate development project as held by them or within its investment in LLCB, for possible indications of impairment. These judgments may relate to the identification of appropriate and comparable market prices, the consideration of changes to legal factors or the business climate, the likelihood of successfully completing the entitlement process, changes in zoning or government regulation, and demand for new housing. Changes in these judgments could have a significant impact on real estate development or equity in investments. Real estate development assets held by the Company were $9,987,000, and equity in investments was $78,816,000 as of October 31, 2023 of which $66,288,000 was allocated to LLCB. For the year ended October 31, 2023, no impairment loss has been recognized on any real estate development and no other-than-temporary-impairment has been recognized on the Companys equity in LLCB.\nWe identified the significant judgments made by management in evaluating real estate development assets held by the Company and equity in investment in LLCB, for possible indicators of impairment, as a critical audit matter. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions when determining whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amount of, or investment in, real estate development assets held by the Company and equity in investment in LLCB may not be recoverable and whether management appropriately identified impairment indicators.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the evaluation of real estate development assets held by the Company and equity in investment in LLCB for possible indications of impairment included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of the controls over managements identification of possible circumstances that may indicate that real estate development assets held by the Company or equity in investment in LLCB is no longer recoverable, including controls over managements evaluation of the entitlement process, litigation, changes in zoning, government regulation, geographical demand and market conditions.\nWe evaluated managements impairment analysis by:\n-Searching for adverse asset-specific and/or market conditions by reviewing publicly available information on land values in the surrounding regions of the development, periodicals and news information relating to the Southern California real estate market\n-Obtaining information from legal counsel and performing inquiries with management in order to evaluate any changes in the status of litigation matters affecting the real estate development assets and the potential impact on the ability to recover the accumulated costs, including any relevant government regulations and/or other matters impacting the entitlement process\n-Obtaining comparable land sales in the area and comparing such data to information used by management with the assistance of our fair value specialists\n-Developing an independent expectation of impairment indicators and comparing such expectation to managements analysis\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nDecember 21, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 3,631 $ 857\nAccounts receivable, net 14,458 15,651\nCultural costs 2,334 8,643\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 5,588 8,496\nReceivables/other from related parties 4,214 3,888\nTotal current assets 30,225 37,535\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 160,631 222,628\nReal estate development 9,987 9,706\nEquity in investments 78,816 72,855\nGoodwill 1,512 1,506\nIntangible assets, net 6,657 7,317\nOther assets 13,382 16,971\nTotal assets $ 301,210 $ 368,518\nLiabilities, Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 9,892 $ 10,663\nGrowers and suppliers payable 9,629 10,740\nAccrued liabilities 8,651 11,279\nPayables to related parties 4,805 4,860\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 381 1,732\nTotal current liabilities 33,358 39,274\nLong-term liabilities:\nLong-term debt, less current portion 40,628 104,076\nDeferred income taxes 22,172 23,497\nOther long-term liabilities 4,555 9,807\nTotal liabilities 100,713 176,654\nCommitments and contingencies -

Business\nLimoneira Company (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company) engages primarily in growing citrus and avocados, picking and hauling citrus, and packing, marketing and selling citrus. The Company is also engaged in residential rentals and other rental operations and real estate development activities.\nThe Company markets and sells citrus directly to food service, wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia and other international markets. The Company was a member of Sunkist Growers, Inc., an agricultural marketing cooperative, and sold a portion of its oranges, specialty citrus and other crops to Sunkist-licensed and other third-party packinghouses.\nThrough fiscal year 2021, the Company sold the majority of its avocado production to Calavo Growers, Inc. (Calavo), a packing and marketing company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CVGW. In February 2022, the Company terminated its Avocado Marketing Agreement and the associated Letter Agreement Regarding Fruit Commitment with Calavo to pursue opportunities with other packing and marketing companies.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the accounts of all the subsidiaries and investments in which the Company holds a controlling interest. The consolidated financial statements represent the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income (loss), statements of stockholders equity and temporary equity and statements of cash flows of Limoneira Company and consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company considers the criteria established under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) - Accounting Standards Code (ASC) 810, Consolidations, and the effect of variable interest entities, in its consolidation process.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company grants credit in the course of its operations to cooperatives, companies and lessees of the Companys facilities. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company provides allowances on its receivables as required based on accounts receivable aging and other factors. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022 the allowances totaled $260,000 and $469,000, respectively. For fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, credit losses were insignificant.\nConcentrations and Geographic Information\nThe Company sells its avocados and oranges, and sold its specialty citrus, to third-party packinghouses. Prior to fiscal year 2022, the Company sold a majority of its avocado production to Calavo. Sales of avocados to Calavo were $6,594,000 in fiscal year 2021.\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to revenues and accounts receivable are limited due to a large, diverse customer base. One individual customer represented 13% of revenue for fiscal year 2023. One individual customer represented 11% of accounts receivable, net as of October 31, 2023.\nNo individual supplier represented 10% of accounts payable as of October 31, 2023.\nLemons procured from third-party growers were 54%, 52% and 52% of the Company's lemon supply in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. One third-party grower was 44% of growers and suppliers payable as of October 31, 2023.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company maintains its cash in federally insured financial institutions. The account balances at these institutions periodically exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage and, as a result, there is a concentration of risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.\nCultural Costs\nGrowing costs, also referred to as cultural costs, consist of orchard maintenance costs such as cultivation, fertilization and soil amendments, pest control, pruning and irrigation. Harvest costs are comprised of labor and equipment expenses incurred to harvest and deliver crops to the packinghouses.\nCertain of the Company's crops have distinct growing periods and distinct harvest and selling periods, each of which lasts approximately four to eight months. During the growing period, cultural costs are capitalized as they are associated with benefiting and preparing the crops for the harvest and selling period. During the harvest and selling period, harvest costs and cultural costs are expensed when incurred and capitalized cultural costs are amortized as components of agribusiness costs and expenses.\nDue to climate, growing conditions and the types of crops grown, certain of the Company's other crops may be harvested and sold on a year-round basis. Accordingly, the Company does not capitalize cultural costs associated with these crops and therefore such costs, as well as harvest costs associated with these crops, are expensed to operations when incurred as components of agribusiness costs and expenses.\nMost cultural costs, including amortization of capitalized cultural costs, and harvest costs are associated with and charged to specific crops. Certain other costs, such as property taxes, indirect labor, including farm supervision and management, and irrigation that benefit multiple crops are allocated to crops on a per acre basis.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nTax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at original cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows (in years):\nLand improvements 10 - 30\nBuildings and building improvements 10 - 50\nEquipment 5 - 20\nOrchards and vineyards 20 - 40\nCosts of planting and developing orchards are capitalized until the orchards become commercially productive. Planting costs consist primarily of the costs to purchase and plant nursery stock. Orchard development costs consist primarily of maintenance costs of orchards such as cultivation, pruning, irrigation, labor, pest control and fertilization, and interest costs during the development period. The Company ceases the capitalization of costs and commences depreciation when the orchards become commercially productive and orchard maintenance costs are accounted for as cultural costs as described above.\nCapitalized Interest\nInterest is capitalized on real estate development projects and significant construction in progress using the weighted average interest rate during the fiscal year. Capitalized interest is included in property, plant, and equipment, equity in investments and real estate development assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nReal Estate Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes the planning, entitlement, construction, development costs and interest associated with its various real estate projects. Costs that are not capitalized, which include property maintenance and repairs, general and administrative and marketing expenses, are expensed as incurred. A real estate development project is considered substantially complete upon the cessation of construction and development activities. Once a project is substantially completed, future costs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalized costs related to its real estate projects of $281,000 and $637,000 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEquity in Investments\nInvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence but less than a controlling interest, or is not the primary beneficiary if the joint venture is determined to be a Variable Interest Entity (VIE), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, are adjusted for capital contributions, distributions, capitalized interest and the Companys equity in net earnings or loss of the respective joint venture. The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate the investments are no longer recoverable or have incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and a non-competition agreement. The Companys definite-life intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives ranging from eight to nine years. Acquired water and mineral rights are indefinite-life assets not subject to amortization. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets, including its property and equipment, real estate development projects and definite-life intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated fair value or undiscounted future cash flows from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company evaluates its indefinite-life intangible assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment of the assets value may exist.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe decline in demand for the Company's products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Company's sales and profitability since the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the Company's sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts are uncertain and therefore cannot be estimated at this time, as they are influenced by a number of factors, many of which are outside managements control.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when an event or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. Goodwill impairment testing involves significant judgment and estimates.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nAccounts receivable, accounts payable, growers and suppliers payable and accrued liabilities reported on the Companys consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of the instruments.\nBased on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt is approximately equal to its carrying amount as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) represents all changes in a companys net assets, except changes resulting from transactions with stockholders. Other comprehensive income or loss includes foreign currency translation items and defined benefit pension items. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is reported as a component of the Company's stockholders' equity.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in other comprehensive income (loss) by component at October 31(in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nPre-tax Amount Tax Benefit (Expense) Net Amount Pre-tax Amount Tax Benefit (Expense) Net Amount Pre-tax Amount Tax Expense Net Amount\nForeign currency translation adjustments $ 518 $ - $ 518 $ (2,430) $ - $ (2,430) $ (685) $ - $ (685)\nMinimum pension liability adjustments:\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications (355) 135 (220) (254) 71 (183) 3,440 (940) 2,500\nAmounts reclassified to earnings included in Other (expense) income, net 2,700 (756) 1,944 607 (169) 438 - - -\nOther comprehensive income (loss) $ 2,863 $ (621) $ 2,242 $ (2,077) $ (98) $ (2,175) $ 2,755 $ (940) $ 1,815\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by component (in thousands):\nForeign Currency Translation Loss Defined Benefit Pension Plan Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nBalance as of October 31, 2020\n$ (3,069) $ (4,479) $ (7,548)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income (685) 2,500 1,815\nBalance as of October 31, 2021\n(3,754) (1,979) (5,733)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income (2,430) 255 (2,175)\nBalance as of October 31, 2022\n(6,184) (1,724) (7,908)\nOther comprehensive income 518 1,724 2,242\nBalance as of October 31, 2023\n$ (5,666) $ - $ (5,666)\nForeign Currency\nThe Company has foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Chilean Peso. Their balance sheets are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries incurred aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses of approximately $204,000 in both of the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and $646,000 for fiscal year 2021. These losses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers, and recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following steps:\nIdentify the contract(s) with a customer;\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract;\nDetermine the transaction price;\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\nRecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company determines the appropriate method by which it recognizes revenue by analyzing the nature of the products or services being provided as well as the terms and conditions of contracts or arrangements entered into with its customers. The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct good or service (i.e., performance obligation) identified in the contract and each performance obligation is valued based on its estimated relative standalone selling price.\nThe Company recognizes the majority of its revenue at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation and transfers control of the product to the respective customer. The amount of revenue that is recognized is based on the transaction price, which represents the invoiced amount and includes estimates of variable consideration such as allowances for estimated customer discounts or concessions, where applicable. The amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur in a future period.\nAgribusiness revenue - Revenue from lemon sales is generally recognized at a point in time when the customer takes control of the fruit from the Companys packinghouse, which aligns with the transfer of title to the customer. The Company has elected to treat any shipping and handling costs incurred after control of the goods has been transferred to the customer as agribusiness costs.\nThe Companys avocados are packed and sold by third-party packinghouses. The Companys arrangements with its third-party packinghouses are such that the Company is the producer and supplier of the product and the third-party packinghouses are the Companys customers. The Company controls the product until it is delivered to the third-party packinghouses at which time control of the product is transferred to the third-party packinghouses and revenue is recognized.\nRevenue from crop insurance proceeds is recorded when the amount can be reasonably determined and upon establishment of the present right to payment. We recorded agribusiness revenues from crop insurance proceeds of $769,000 and $449,000 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no proceeds received in fiscal year 2021.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were immaterial in fiscal year 2023 and $165,000 and $178,000 in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLeases\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessee - The Company enters into leases as a lessee generally for agricultural land and packinghouse facilities and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating and finance leases are included in other assets, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets. Lease right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, measured on a discounted basis. Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Company uses either its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date, or the rate implicit in the lease, if known, in determining the present value of future payments.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nLeases (continued)\nOperating lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as the Company has elected to recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company had material leases with related parties which are further described in Note 15 - Related-Party Transactions.\nCertain of the Companys agricultural land agreements contain variable costs based on a percentage of the operating results of the leased property. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. These land agreements also contain costs for non-lease components, such as water usage, which the Company accounts for separately from the lease components. For all other agreements, the Company generally combines lease and non-lease components in calculating the ROU assets and lease liabilities. See Note 13 - Leases for additional information.\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessor - Leases in which the Company acts as the lessor include land, residential and commercial units and are all classified as operating leases. Certain of the Companys contracts contain variable income based on a percentage of the operating results of the leased asset. Certain of the Companys contracts contain non-lease components such as water, utilities and common area services. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its lessor arrangements and the combined component is accounted for entirely under ASC 842, Leases. The underlying asset in an operating lease arrangement is carried at depreciated cost within property, plant, and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful life of the underlying asset. The Company recognizes operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period without consideration of the dilutive effect of conversion of preferred stock. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of conversion of unvested, restricted stock and preferred stock.\nDiluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated using the more dilutive method of either the two-class method or the treasury stock method. Unvested stock-based compensation awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends as participating shares are included in computing earnings per share. The Companys unvested, restricted stock awards qualify as participating shares.\nDefined Benefit Retirement Plan\nThe Company sponsored a defined benefit retirement plan (the Plan) that was frozen in June 2004, and no future benefits accrued to participants subsequent to that time. In fiscal year 2021, the Company terminated the Plan effective December 31, 2021. On November 4, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Principal Life Insurance Company for the purchase of an annuity contract in connection with the Plan termination. On November 10, 2022, the annuity contract was purchased for $12,617,000, payable with Plan assets and a $2,500,000 cash payment from the Company.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n3. Asset Sales and Disposals\nNorthern Properties\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, as amended, (the Agreement) with PGIM Real Estate Finance, LLC (PGIM) to sell 3,537 acres of land and citrus orchards in Tulare County, California (the Northern Properties) for a purchase price of approximately $100,405,000. On January 25, 2023, the Board approved the Agreement creating a binding agreement of the Company to sell the Northern Properties and the transaction closed on January 31, 2023. During the quarter ended April 30, 2023, the purchase price was decreased by $397,000 for reimbursement of certain cultural costs and prepaid expenses, resulting in a final purchase price of $100,008,000. After transaction costs the Company received net proceeds of $98,411,000.\nThe following is a summary of the transaction (in thousands):\nNet cash proceeds received $ 85,494\nDebt directly repaid through the transaction 12,917\nTotal net proceeds received 98,411\nLess: net book value of assets sold\nCultural costs 3,853\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 155\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 53,144\nIntangible assets, net 12\nOther assets 1,320\nAccrued liabilities (68)\n58,416\nGain on disposal of assets $ 39,995\nThe proceeds were used to pay down all of the Companys domestic debt except the AgWest Farm Credit $40,000,000 non-revolving line of credit. The Northern Properties component, including an allocation of interest expense related to the debt directly repaid through the transaction, had a pretax (loss) gain of $(1,667,000), $(1,236,000) and $3,334,000 for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOn January 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Farm Management Agreement (FMA) with an affiliate of PGIM to provide farming, management and operations services related to the Northern Properties. The FMA has an initial term expiring March 31, 2024, and thereafter continuing from year to year unless earlier terminated under the terms of the FMA. Further, on January 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Grower Packing and Marketing Agreement to provide packing, marketing and selling services for lemons harvested on the Northern Properties for a minimum five-year term, subject to certain benchmarking standards.\nCadiz Ranch\nIn April 2023, the Company determined that citrus farming operations were economically unviable on 670 acres of leased agricultural land at the Cadiz Ranch. As a result, the Company ceased farming operations, disposed of the related property, plant and equipment and recorded a loss on disposal of assets of $9,012,000 during fiscal year 2023.\nOxnard Lemon\nIn October 2022, the Company sold the Oxnard Lemon property and packing facility located in Ventura County, California. The Company received net proceeds of $19,144,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $846,000, which is included in (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Concurrent with the closing of the sale, the Company entered into a lease agreement to continue use of the property as a lessee for a period of 36 months from the closing date, with extension options for an additional 24 months.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n4.

Real Estate Development\nReal estate development assets are comprised of land and land development costs for the East Area II property in the amount of $9,987,000 and $9,706,000 as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEast Area I, Retained Property and East Area II\nIn fiscal year 2005, the Company began capitalizing the costs of two real estate development projects east of Santa Paula, California, for the development of 550 acres of land into residential units, commercial buildings and civic facilities. In November 2015 (the Transaction Date), the Company entered into a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (Lewis) for the residential development of its East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, the Company formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (LLCB) as the development entity, contributed its East Area I property to LLCB, and sold a 50% interest to Lewis for $20,000,000.\nThe Company and LLCB also entered into a Retained Property Development Agreement on the Transaction Date (the Retained Property Agreement). Under the terms of the Retained Property Agreement, LLCB transferred certain contributed East Area I property, which is entitled for commercial development, back to the Company (the Retained Property) and arranged for the design and construction of certain improvements to the Retained Property, subject to certain reimbursements by the Company. The balance in East Area II includes estimated costs incurred by and reimbursable to LLCB of $3,444,000 as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, which is included in payables to related parties.\nLIMONEIRA COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n6. Real Estate Development (continued)\nIn January 2018, LLCB entered into a $45,000,000 unsecured Line of Credit Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the Loan) with Bank of America, N.A. to fund early development activities. Effective as of February 22, 2023, the Loan maturity date was extended to February 22, 2024, and the maximum borrowing amount was reduced to $35,000,000.

Earnings Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period without consideration of the dilutive effect of conversion of preferred stock. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of conversion of unvested, restricted stock and preferred stock. The Series B and Series B-2 convertible preferred shares were anti-dilutive for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. The computations for basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share are as follows for the fiscal years ended October 31 (in thousands, except per share data):\n2023 2022 2021\nBasic net income (loss) per common share:\nNet income (loss) applicable to common stock $ 8,899 $ (737) $ (3,942)\nEffect of unvested, restricted stock (146) (50) (35)\nNumerator: Net income (loss) for basic EPS 8,753 (787) (3,977)\nDenominator: Weighted average common shares-basic 17,603 17,513 17,555\nBasic net income (loss) per common share $ 0.50 $ (0.04) $ (0.23)\nDiluted net income (loss) per common share:\nNet income (loss) for basic EPS $ 8,753 $ (787) $ (3,977)\nEffect of dilutive preferred stock - - -\nNumerator: Net income (loss) for diluted EPS 8,753 (787) (3,977)\nWeighted average common shares-basic 17,603 17,513 17,555\nEffect of dilutive preferred stock - - -\nDenominator: Weighted average common shares-diluted 17,603 17,513 17,555\nDiluted net income (loss) per common share $ 0.50 $ (0.04) $ (0.23)\nDiluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated using the more dilutive method of either the two-class method or the treasury stock method. Unvested stock-based compensation awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends as participating shares are included in computing earnings per share. The Companys unvested, restricted stock awards qualify as participating shares. Diluted net income (loss) per common share was calculated under the two-class method for fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The Company excluded 117,000 unvested, restricted shares, as calculated under the treasury stock method, from its computation of diluted net loss per common share for fiscal year 2021.\n15.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation and Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is from time to time involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. At this time, the Company is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against it that it expects will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity or operating results.

The conversion price is $8.00 per share of Common Stock.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures. As of October 31, 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting. Refer to Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm below.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of Limoneira Company (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Limoneira Companys internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2023. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and has issued a report on internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\nHarold S. Edwards\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nMark Palamountain\nChief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Limoneira Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Limoneira Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated December 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements based on our audit and the report of the other auditors.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nDecember 21, 2023\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2023, or, to our knowledge, in other factors that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. Control systems, no matter how well conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Item 9B. Other Information\nNone.\nItem 9C.
