    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nD.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 106 markets across 33 states, primarily under the names of D.R. Horton, Americas Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol DHI. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms D.R. Horton, the Company, we and our used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.\nOur homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing available capital into our existing markets, start-up operations in new markets and acquisitions of other homebuilding companies. Our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. Our product offerings include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers. Our homes generally range in size from 1,000 to more than 4,000 square feet and in price from $200,000 to more than $1,000,000. For the year ended September 30, 2022, our homebuilding operations closed 82,744 homes with an average closing price of $385,100.\nOur business operations consist of homebuilding, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services, rental and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are our core business, generating 95% of our consolidated revenues of $33.5 billion in fiscal 2022, 96% of consolidated revenues of $27.8 billion in fiscal 2021 and 97% of consolidated revenues of $20.3 billion in fiscal 2020. Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 91% of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2022 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.\nDuring fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol FOR. Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational and capital efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled through land purchase contracts. At September 30, 2022, we owned 63% of Forestars outstanding common stock.\nOur financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers after origination. Our wholly-owned subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination, underwriting and closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.\nOur rental segment consists of multi-family and single-family rental operations. The multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties. The single-family rental operations primarily construct and lease single-family homes within a community and then market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes.\nIn addition to our homebuilding, Forestar, financial services and rental operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, own water rights and other water-related assets, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate energy-related assets. The results of these operations are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our website, www.drhorton.com, all of our reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Information on or linked to our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K unless expressly noted.\nOPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES\nFollowing is an overview of our companys operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls, strategies and performance.\nHomebuilding Markets\nOur homebuilding business operates in 106 markets across 33 states, which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business.\nWe conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance.\nState Reporting Region/Market State Reporting Region/Market\nNorthwest Region Southeast Region (Continued)\nColorado Colorado Springs Florida Ocala\nDenver Orlando\nFort Collins Pensacola/Panama City\nOregon Bend Port St. Lucie\nEugene/Springfield Tallahassee\nPortland/Salem Tampa/Sarasota\nUtah Salt Lake City Volusia County\nSt. George West Palm Beach\nWashington Central Washington Louisiana Baton Rouge\nSeattle/Tacoma/Everett/Olympia Lake Charles/Lafayette\nSpokane Mississippi Gulf Coast\nVancouver\nEast Region\nSouthwest Region Georgia Atlanta\nArizona Phoenix Augusta\nTucson Central Georgia\nCalifornia Bakersfield Savannah\nBay Area North Carolina Asheville\nFresno/Tulare Charlotte\nLos Angeles County Greensboro/Winston-Salem\nModesto/Merced/Stockton New Bern/Greenville\nRiverside County Raleigh/Durham\nSacramento Wilmington\nSan Bernardino County South Carolina Charleston\nHawaii Oahu Columbia\nNevada Las Vegas Greenville/Spartanburg\nReno Hilton Head\nNew Mexico Albuquerque Myrtle Beach\nTennessee Chattanooga\nSouth Central Region Knoxville\nArkansas Northwest Arkansas Memphis\nOklahoma Oklahoma City Nashville\nTulsa\nTexas Austin North Region\nBeaumont Delaware Central Delaware\nBryan/College Station Northern Delaware\nCorpus Christi Illinois Chicago\nDallas Indiana Fort Wayne\nFort Worth Indianapolis\nHouston Northwest Indiana\nKilleen/Temple/Waco Iowa Des Moines\nLubbock Iowa City/Cedar Rapids\nMidland/Odessa Kentucky Louisville\nNew Braunfels/San Marcos Maryland Baltimore\nSan Antonio Suburban Washington, D.C.\nWestern Maryland\nSoutheast Region Minnesota Minneapolis/St. Paul\nAlabama Birmingham Nebraska Omaha\nHuntsville New Jersey Northern New Jersey\nMobile/Baldwin County Southern New Jersey\nMontgomery Ohio Cincinnati\nTuscaloosa Columbus\nFlorida Fort Myers/Naples Pennsylvania Central Pennsylvania\nGainesville Philadelphia\nJacksonville Virginia Northern Virginia\nLakeland Richmond\nMelbourne/Vero Beach Virginia Beach/Williamsburg\nMiami/Fort Lauderdale West Virginia Eastern West Virginia\nWhen evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:\nEconomic conditions;\nEmployment levels and job growth;\nIncome level of potential homebuyers;\nLocal housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;\nMarket for homes at our targeted price points;\nAvailability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;\nLand entitlement and development processes;\nAvailability of qualified subcontractors;\nNew and secondary home sales activity;\nCompetition;\nPrevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing; and\nPerformance capabilities of our local management team.\nEconomies of Scale\nWe are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in fiscal 2022 as measured by number of homes closed, and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:\nGreater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships;\nVolume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and\nEnhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets.\nDecentralized Homebuilding Operations\nWe view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who are familiar with local market conditions, have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations. At September 30, 2022, we had 78 separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller and accounting personnel; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents receive performance-based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices.\nOperating Division Responsibilities\nEach homebuilding operating division is responsible for:\nSite selection, which involves\n- A feasibility study;\n- Soil and environmental reviews;\n- Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;\n- Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements; and\n- Financial analysis of the potential project;\nNegotiating lot purchase, land acquisition and related contracts;\nObtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;\nSelecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;\nSelecting building and architectural plans;\nSelecting home construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;\nPlanning and managing home construction schedules;\nDetermining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community;\nDeveloping and implementing local marketing and sales plans;\nCoordinating all interactions with customers and real estate brokers during the sales, construction and home closing processes; and\nEnsuring the quality and timeliness of post-closing service and warranty repairs provided to customers.\nCentralized Controls\nWe centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have separate homebuilding regional offices, which generally consist of a region president, a chief financial officer, legal counsel and other operational and office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including:\nReview and approval of division business plans and budgets;\nReview and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;\nReview of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;\nOversight of land and home inventory levels;\nMonitoring division financial and operating performance; and\nReview of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.\nOur corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:\nFinancing;\nCash management;\nAllocation of capital;\nIssuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines;\nApproval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;\nMonitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels;\nRisk and litigation management;\nEnvironmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;\nTechnology systems to support management of operations, marketing and financial information;\nAccounting and management reporting;\nIncome taxes;\nInternal audit;\nPublic reporting and investor and media relations;\nAdministration of payroll and employee benefits;\nNegotiation of national purchasing contracts;\nAdministration, reporting and monitoring of customer satisfaction surveys and resolutions of issues; and\nApproval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.\nLand/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management\nWe acquire land for use in our homebuilding and rental operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons.\nWe also enter into land/lot contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. These contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership.\nWe directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures. Joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest, or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence, but not control.\nWe attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:\nControlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of land/lots owned and controlled through purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets;\nMonitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;\nUtilizing land/lot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible; and\nMonitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision.\nLand Development and Home Construction\nSubstantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. We employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on post-closing home maintenance.\nOur home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers expectations for affordability, home size and features, and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary. In many communities, we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We completed the construction of most homes in four to nine months during fiscal 2022, which is longer than prior years, as construction times have been impacted by the labor and materials shortages discussed below.\nWe typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations have been readily available from numerous sources, and we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option. In fiscal 2021, our construction cycle time lengthened primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our supply chain, which resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the construction labor market. Continuing supply chain delays and disruptions during fiscal 2022 lengthened our construction cycle time further.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations. In fiscal 2021 and 2022, we frequently experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies, which delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities.\nCost Controls\nWe control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations.\nWe control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions, monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives, which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures.\nMarketing and Sales\nWe primarily use the D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes brand names to market and sell our homes. Our D.R. Horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings, focusing primarily on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer. Our Emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higher-end move-up and luxury homes. Our Express branded communities primarily accommodate entry-level buyers who are focused on affordability. Our Freedom Homes brand offers homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle.\nWe market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees, and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options, when available. We train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives, such as discounts or included upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace.\nWe market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally, through email, search engine marketing, social media and our company website and other real estate websites, in addition to print media and advertisement. We also use billboards, radio, television and print advertising locally as necessary. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.\nWe also build speculative homes in most of our communities, which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our returns. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame, as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth and relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We attempt to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis.\nSales Contracts and Backlog\nOur sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a defined period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.\nSales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. At September 30, 2022, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $8.0 billion (19,614 homes), a decrease of 16% from $9.5 billion (26,221 homes) at September 30, 2021. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $406,600 at September 30, 2022, up from the $360,900 average at September 30, 2021. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts were 21% in fiscal 2022 compared to 17% in fiscal 2021.\nThe length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally from two to seven months; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at September 30, 2022 are scheduled to close in fiscal 2023.\nCustomer Service and Quality Control\nOur homebuilding operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are expected to respond to us and the homeowner in a timely manner. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturers warranties on specified products installed in the home.\nRental Properties\nOur multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential properties that produce rental income. We primarily focus on constructing garden style multi-family rental communities, typically accommodating 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets. We sold 775 multi-family rental units in fiscal 2022 compared to 959 units in fiscal 2021. Our single-family rental operations construct and lease single-family homes within a community and then market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. We sold 774 single-family rental homes in fiscal 2022 compared to 257 homes in fiscal 2021.\nForestar Residential Lot Development Operations\nDuring fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar. Forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 53 markets across 21 states as of September 30, 2022. We owned approximately 63% of Forestars outstanding common stock at September 30, 2022. Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled through land purchase contracts. Forestar is investing in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidate market share in the fragmented U.S. lot development industry. Our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. A shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide Forestar certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services. As the controlling shareholder, we have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and operations of Forestar.\nCustomer Mortgage Financing\nWe provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient experience for our homebuyers. During the year ended September 30, 2022, DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 69% of our total homes closed, and approximately 98% of DHI Mortgages loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers.\nTo limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans, the majority of which are eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers after origination with limited recourse provisions. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting.\nTitle Services\nThrough our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies, examination, underwriting and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers.\nHuman Capital Resources\nPeople and Culture\nFor the past three fiscal years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased the number of employees in all of our operating segments and made no reductions to our employee compensation plans or employee benefit plans. As of September 30, 2022, we employed 13,237 people, of whom 8,967 work in our homebuilding operations, 3,024 in our financial services segment, 532 at our corporate office, 364 in our rental operations, 291 at our Forestar subsidiary and 59 in our other businesses. Of our homebuilding employees, 3,893 are involved in construction, 2,054 are sales and marketing personnel and 3,020 are office personnel.\nWe believe the people who work for our company are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. Our people are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must certify to their understanding of and adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination.\nRecruitment, Development and Retention\nWe are committed to hiring, developing and supporting an energetic, diverse workforce and maintaining a productive, positive and inclusive workplace. We believe diversity in the workplace produces unique perspectives and fresh ideas and helps us better serve our customers. We have an active recruiting team that partners with college campuses and external organizations to identify strong new hires and experienced professionals. Our paid internship program provides college students and recent graduates an opportunity to work alongside some of the most experienced professionals in the homebuilding industry. Our management team also supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees. During fiscal 2022, we held specialized trainings for employees within key business functions of our homebuilding operations, such as purchasing, construction and sales, and we held our inaugural Leadership Development Program, which provides internal training for up and coming leaders within our homebuilding operations. Additionally, during the fiscal year, 25 employees were placed into a new homebuilding market leadership position, and of those 100% were promoted from within the organization.\nThe long-term retention of our employees provides us with an experienced, cohesive workforce, which has been vital to achieving our goals. Our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our executive, regional and divisional management teams. The average tenure of our executive team is 29 years, our homebuilding region presidents is 20 years, our homebuilding division presidents is 14 years and our city managers is greater than 10 years. Our Board of Directors is actively involved in the Companys executive leadership succession planning and is equally committed to our culture of promoting rising talent from within.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. In addition to base pay, eligible employees may participate in our incentive bonus and stock compensation plans, which align their compensation to the interests of our shareholders. A substantial portion of our executive and senior operating leaderships total compensation is variable, at-risk pay based on the Companys performance. We also offer our employees a broad range of benefits, including paid vacation, holidays, sick time and parental leave; medical, dental and vision healthcare insurance and life insurance and disability coverage. The Company is committed to supporting its employees in their health, wellness and financial planning goals. Additional benefits offered include a 401(k) savings plan, employee stock purchase plan and access to professional resources to support employees with their mental and physical health, financial planning, identity theft protection and legal needs. Additional information about our compensation and employee benefit plans is included in Note K to the accompanying financial statements.\nWorkplace Safety and Wellness\nThe safety and well-being of our employees is our first priority. We take workplace safety seriously at our construction sites and in our offices. We provide third-party training for our field personnel to become certified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; we provide our teams with many safety resources, including safety checklists, policies, procedures and best practices; and we communicate with all of our employees through a monthly safety newsletter to inform and reinforce our commitment to and concern for their well-being. Additionally, because substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors, we require that our subcontractors maintain safety programs as well.\nWe implemented safety protocols to protect our employees and our homebuyers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These protocols include complying with health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. Our experienced teams adapted to the changes in our work environment and managed our business successfully during this challenging time. To support our employees throughout the pandemic, employee access to remote work and virtual meetings was expanded. Once available, COVID-19 vaccinations were provided at no charge through Company sponsored health insurance plans. We also have had no workforce or salary reductions related to the pandemic.\nAdditional information regarding human capital is available in the ESG section of our Investor Relations website at investor.drhorton.com, and we anticipate including more details regarding human capital and associated initiatives in our upcoming inaugural ESG report.\nEnvironmental, Social & Governance (ESG)\nDuring fiscal 2022, we made significant progress on our ESG initiatives, which included conducting an ESG materiality survey and assessment to understand, confirm and prioritize the topics our stakeholders believe are important to our company. The key topics that we plan to address in our upcoming inaugural ESG report include, but are not limited to:\nBoard oversight, ethics, diversity and independence\nHome affordability and community impact\nHome energy efficiency, quality and safety\nWorkplace health and safety\nTalent retention and employee well-being\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\nResponsible land development\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nWe plan to publish our inaugural ESG report during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. Acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts. Also, employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time.\nCompetition\nThe homebuilding, lot development and rental housing industries are highly competitive. We compete not only for homebuyers and renters, but also for desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor and financing. We compete with local, regional and national companies in these industries and also with existing home sales, foreclosures and rental properties. We compete on the basis of price, location, quality and design of our homes and on mortgage financing terms.\nThe competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do, may operate with different lending criteria and/or may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers. We strive to provide flexible, fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations.\nOur businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, managers and executives. Competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding, lot development, financial services and rental housing industries and in the general economy.\nGovernmental Regulations and Environmental Matters\nThe homebuilding, lot development and rental housing industries are subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.\nOur construction and land development activities are also subject to an extensive array of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business. Additionally, our compliance with such regulations has not had, nor is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, changes in regulations could increase our costs to comply with such regulations, as discussed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDiscussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to, many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control. Although the risks are organized and described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner.\nRisks Related to our Business and our Industry\nThe homebuilding, lot development and rental housing industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic, real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe homebuilding, lot development and rental housing industries are cyclical and are significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions, such as:\nemployment levels;\nconsumer confidence and spending;\nhousing demand;\navailability of financing for homebuyers;\navailability of financing for companies that purchase our rental properties;\ninterest rates;\ninflation;\navailability and prices of new homes and existing homes for sale and availability and market values of rental properties; and\ndemographic trends.\nAdverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy may negatively impact our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and write-offs. Changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others. If adverse conditions affect our larger markets, they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other companies.\nThe federal governments fiscal policies and the Federal Reserves monetary policies may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence and could hurt the U.S. economy and the housing and rental markets and in turn, could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses. During fiscal 2022, in response to increased inflation, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates significantly and has signaled it expects additional future interest rate increases. As a result, mortgage interest rates increased significantly, and we began to see a moderation in housing demand. Increases in mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes and can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nDeployments of U.S. military personnel to foreign regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the United States or others, domestic or international instability or social or political unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we experience any of the foregoing, potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes or our rental properties. Additionally, cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above. Our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions. We may be unable to change the mix of our home or rental offerings, reduce the costs of the homes or properties we build, offer more affordable homes or rental properties or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns.\nOur financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations. We may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to third-party purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan, and we may be required to repurchase certain of those mortgage loans or provide indemnification. Repurchased mortgage loans and/or the settlement of claims associated with such loans could adversely affect our business or financial results. We establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold; however, actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts. Additionally, we may retain mortgage servicing rights on our originations. As servicer for these loans, we may incur losses by having to advance payments to the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) bondholders to the extent there are insufficient collections to satisfy the required principal and interest remittances of the underlying MBS.\nConstriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital.\nDuring past economic and housing downturns, the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us. Consequently, we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times. There likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing.\nOur homebuilding operations utilize a $2.19 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $3.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. Our homebuilding revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the total revolving credit commitments. The maturity date of the facility is October 28, 2027. Our homebuilding revolving credit facility and our homebuilding senior notes are guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc.s significant wholly-owned homebuilding subsidiaries.\nForestar has a $410 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $600 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The Forestar revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. The maturity date of the facility is October 28, 2026. The Forestar revolving credit facility is guaranteed by Forestars wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. The Forestar revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, financial services or rental operations.\nDRH Rental has a $1.025 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. Availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of DRH Rentals real estate assets and unrestricted cash. At September 30, 2022, the borrowing base limited the available capacity under the facility to $811.9 million. The rental revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. The maturity date of the facility is March 4, 2026. The rental revolving credit facility is guaranteed by DRH Rentals wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. The rental revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, Forestar or financial services operations.\nOur mortgage subsidiary utilizes a $1.6 billion mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates. The capacity of the facility automatically increases during certain higher volume periods and can be further increased through additional commitments. The total capacity of the facility at September 30, 2022 was $2.2 billion, and its maturity date is February 17, 2023. Adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts. Such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate. The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, Forestar or rental operations.\nWe regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in July 2021, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in October 2021, registering $750 million of equity securities, of which $300 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program that became effective in November 2021. At September 30, 2022, $748.2 million remained available for issuance under Forestars shelf registration statement, of which $298.2 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, together with the homebuilding, Forestar and rental revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations. Adverse changes in economic, homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business, liquidity and financial results, restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital.\nReductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies, changes in government financing programs, a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae and are typically sold to third-party purchasers. The secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market. Any significant change regarding the long-term structure and viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products. Additionally, a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans. During fiscal 2022, approximately 62% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 30% were sold to one other major financial entity. On an ongoing basis, we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities. If we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms, our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited, which would negatively affect our profitability.\nThe FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes. Changes, restrictions or significant premium increases in FHA programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of FHA financing, which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes.\nSome of our customers may qualify for 100% financing through programs offered by the VA and the USDA and certain other housing finance agencies. These programs are subject to changes in regulations, lending standards and government funding levels. There can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered, which could negatively affect our sales.\nMortgage interest rates have increased significantly during fiscal 2022, and market conditions and government actions could cause mortgage rates to rise even further in the future. When interest rates increase, the cost of owning a home increases, which reduces the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and can result in a decline in the demand for our homes.\nThe risks associated with our land, lot and rental inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nInventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding, Forestar and rental businesses. There are risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land. If housing demand declines, we may not be able to sell homes or rental properties profitably in some of our communities, and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own. Also, the values of our owned undeveloped land, lots and inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions. As a result, our deposits for lots controlled through purchase contracts may be put at risk, we may have to sell homes, rental properties or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots. A significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges.\nWe cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies, acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences.\nIn recent years, we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land, lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets. We have also expanded through investments in new product offerings, new geographic markets and the growth of our rental property operations. Investments in land, lots, home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies.\nWe have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years, and in May 2022, we acquired Vidler Water Resources, Inc. (Vidler) for a total purchase price of $290.5 million. The assets acquired through the Vidler transaction consisted primarily of water rights and other water-related assets.\nWe may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies, operations or assets in the future. Such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land, lots and home inventories, but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences. These transactions may not advance our business strategy, provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate. Also, the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources, which may divert managements attention from other operations. Acquisitions and investments could also raise new compliance-related obligations or expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process that may lead to litigation. If these transactions under-perform our expectations or are unsuccessful, we may incur significant expenses or write-offs of inventory, other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill. Acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial position and general economic and business conditions. We also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation, higher interest rates or deflation.\nInflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing affordability. During fiscal 2022, we began to see a moderation in housing demand as inflationary pressures and mortgage interest rates increased. In an inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. Moreover, in an inflationary environment, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline, which can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes. These or other factors related to deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.\nSupply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land, building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries.\nThe homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction, including:\ndifficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers want to live;\nshortages of qualified subcontractors;\nreliance on local subcontractors, manufacturers, distributors and land developers who may be inadequately capitalized;\nshortages of materials; and\nsignificant increases in the cost of materials, particularly increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs.\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2022, we have experienced multiple disruptions in our supply chain, which have resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the labor market. This has caused our construction cycle to lengthen and costs of building materials to increase. If shortages and cost increases in building materials and tightness in the labor market persist for a prolonged period of time, our profit margins could be adversely impacted if we are unable to offset cost increases by increasing the selling price of our homes.\nIn addition, tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions imposed or increased on imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes, including steel, aluminum and lumber, may raise our costs for these items or for the products made with them. These factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes.\nPublic health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe U.S. and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy. The effects of the pandemic contributed to disrupting our supply chain, which has resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the labor market.\nThere is uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long COVID-19 and its variant strains will continue to impact the global economy and our supply chain, and the effect of the pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including its impact on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If COVID-19 and its variant strains continue to have a negative impact on economic conditions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters.\nPhysical risks, including weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic activity, droughts, floods, hailstorms, heavy or prolonged precipitation, wildfires and others, can harm our business. Additionally, the physical impacts of climate change may cause these occurrences to increase in frequency, severity and duration. Any such events can temporarily delay our development work, home construction and home closings, unfavorably affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, damage homes under construction, lead to changing consumer preferences and/or negatively impact demand for new homes in affected areas. We have experienced temporary delays in production and short-term impacts on our sales and closings activity from weather events in recent years. However, there have been no material lasting impacts on our business from these events or material permanent operational challenges resulting from these events, but they could adversely affect our business in the future. The climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate, including California, Florida, Texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters, present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters.\nHomebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.\nWe are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business. We rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to select and obtain construction materials. Despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process, our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes. When we find these issues, we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations. We spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers. Additionally, we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system. Warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet, which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes.\nBased on the large number of homes we have sold over the years, our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant. Consequently, we have generally maintained product liability insurance each year, and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials. We establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims. Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly. We have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by self-insuring our risk for certain years and by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly. If costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates, our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nA health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage.\nBuilding and land development sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in this industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct, health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly. Such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to attract customers and employees, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity.\nWe are required to obtain performance bonds, the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. At September 30, 2022, we had $2.8 billion of outstanding surety bonds. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past performance and other factors, including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. The ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities. If we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nSignificant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage loan interest and state and local income and property taxes, have historically been deductible expenses for an individuals federal income taxes, subject to various limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became effective January 1, 2018, established new limits on these federal tax deductions. Further changes in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes.\nIn addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding, could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes.\nFurther, existing and prospective regulatory and societal responses to climate change intended to reduce potential climate change impacts may increase the upfront costs of purchasing a home, costs to maintain the home and its systems, energy and utility costs and the cost to obtain homeowner and various hazard and flood insurance, or limit homeowners ability to obtain these insurance policies altogether. Although these items have had no material effect on our business, they could adversely affect our business in the future.\nGovernmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction, including zoning, density restrictions, building design and building standards. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved, if approved at all. We are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities, roads or other local services. New housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives. Any of these may limit, delay or increase the costs of development or home construction.\nWe are also subject to a significant number and variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety, labor standards and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Government agencies also routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant.\nRecently, there has been growing concern from advocacy groups, government agencies and the general public over the effects of climate change on the environment. Transition risks, such as government restrictions, standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and potential climate change impacts, are emerging and may increase in the future in the form of restrictions or additional requirements on land development and home construction in certain areas. Such restrictions and requirements could increase our operating and compliance costs or require additional technology and capital investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations. This is a particular concern in the western United States, where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted, and where we have business operations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing climate-related government restrictions, standards and regulations applicable to our business, and such compliance has not had a material impact on our business. However, given the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws and matters that may arise that are not currently known, we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters, and our future costs to achieve compliance or remedy potential violations could be significant.\nAdditionally, actual or perceived ESG and other sustainability matters and our response to these matters could harm our business. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. These factors may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to adequately address such ESG matters or fail to comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.\nThe subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local, state and federal laws and regulations, including laws involving matters that are not within our control. If the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws, we can suffer reputational damage, and may be exposed to possible liability.\nWe are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and the common stock of our Forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets. These regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets, our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes, and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel. Changes in these laws and regulations, including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities, may require us to incur additional compliance costs, and such costs may be significant.\nGovernmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nOur financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies. Additional future regulations or changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe operate in competitive industries, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nThe homebuilding, lot development and rental housing industries are highly competitive. We compete not only for homebuyers and renters, but also for desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor and financing. We compete with local, regional and national companies in these industries, and also with existing home sales, foreclosures and rental properties. The competitive conditions in these industries can negatively affect our sales volumes, selling prices, leased occupancy levels, rental rates and incentive levels, reduce our profit margins, and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired. Competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land, raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms, or cause delays in land development or in construction.\nThe competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do, may operate with different lending criteria and/or may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers.\nOur businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, managers and executives. Competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding, lot development, financial services and rental housing industries and in the general economy. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees, managers or executives, our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt, which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our consolidated debt was $6.1 billion, which consisted of $2.9 billion related to our homebuilding segment, $706 million related to our Forestar segment, $800 million related to our rental segment and $1.6 billion related to our financial services segment. The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt. Also, the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our homebuilding senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facility to incur debt secured by certain assets, but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt. The Forestar revolving credit facility and the indentures governing Forestars senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of Forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt, but still permit Forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt, and do not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by Forestars unrestricted subsidiaries. The rental revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on the ability of DRH Rental and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt, but still permits DRH Rental and its restricted subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt, and does not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by DRH Rentals unrestricted subsidiaries. The mortgage repurchase facility imposes restrictions on the ability of DHI Mortgage and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt, but still permits DHI Mortgage and its restricted subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt, and does not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by DHI Mortgages unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries could have important consequences. For example, possible consequences for our homebuilding, Forestar, financial services and rental operations each with respect to their individual debt obligations, could:\nrequire the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payment of debt and reduce the ability to use cash flow for other operating or investing purposes;\nlimit the flexibility to adjust to changes in business or economic conditions; and\nlimit the ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other requirements.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we or our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash flow from our respective businesses to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability and that of our subsidiaries to meet our respective debt service obligations will depend, in part, upon our and our subsidiaries future financial performance. Future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our businesses are also affected by financial, political, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity, the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations, because borrowings under the homebuilding, Forestar and rental revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates.\nThe instruments governing our and our subsidiaries indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries business, and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with related covenants, restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries financial condition or operating flexibility.\nThe restrictions imposed by our and certain of our subsidiaries indebtedness could limit our or our subsidiaries ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries ability to, among other things, engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets, incur secured debt, create liens, pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities, sell certain assets and engage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The applicable instruments governing each of Forestars indebtedness and DRH Rentals indebtedness contain restrictions on the ability of Forestar and DRH Rental, as applicable, and certain of their respective subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities, sell certain assets, enter into affiliate transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of Forestars or DRH Rentals assets, as applicable.\nIn addition, the agreements governing certain of our and our subsidiaries debt instruments contain the following financial covenants:\nHomebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.\nForestar and rental revolving credit facilities. The Forestar and rental revolving credit facilities each contain financial covenants requiring the maintenance by Forestar or DRH Rental, as applicable, of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity, a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of Forestars or DRH Rentals real estate assets and unrestricted cash. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the applicable revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.\nMortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions. The mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary. A failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. Any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly.\nIn addition, although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our and Forestars senior notes or the agreements governing the homebuilding, Forestar and rental revolving credit facilities, the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility. Moreover, our right to receive assets from our financial services subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims.\nOur access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our debt ratings.\nOur homebuilding senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings. Any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult and/or more expensive. Any lowering of Forestars debt ratings could also make Forestars ability to access the public capital markets or obtain additional credit from banks more difficult and/or more expensive.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain change of control provisions which could affect the timing of repayment.\nChange of control purchase options under our homebuilding senior notes and change of control default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event, each as defined in the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Moreover, a change of control (as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facility) would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility, a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder. If repayment of more than $50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied, in either case within 30 days, an event of default would result under the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes, entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately. If purchase offers were required under the indentures for our homebuilding senior notes, repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were required, or if the senior notes were accelerated, we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.\nChange of control purchase option under Forestars notes and change of control default under the Forestar revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures governing Forestars notes), Forestar will be required to offer to repurchase Forestars notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A change of control (as defined in the Forestar revolving credit facility) with respect to Forestar would constitute an event of default under the Forestar revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the Forestar revolving credit facility, a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder. If the maturity of the Forestar revolving credit facility and/or other indebtedness of Forestar and its restricted subsidiaries together having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $40 million or more is accelerated, an event of default would result under the indentures governing the Forestar notes, entitling the trustee for the Forestar notes or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Forestar notes to declare all such Forestar notes to be due and payable immediately. If purchase offers were required under the indentures for Forestars notes, repayment of the borrowings under Forestars revolving credit facility were required, or if Forestars notes were accelerated, we can give no assurance that Forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.\nChange of control default under the rental revolving credit facility. A change of control (as defined in the rental revolving credit facility agreement) with respect to DRH Rental would constitute an event of default under the rental revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the rental revolving credit facility, a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder. If repayment of the borrowings under the rental revolving credit facility were required, we can give no assurance that DRH Rental would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.\nChange of control default under mortgage repurchase facility. A change of control (as defined in the mortgage repurchase facility) with respect to DHI Mortgage would constitute an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repurchase of any loans outstanding under the facility and an increase in the repurchase price of such loans. If repayments of the loans under DHI Mortgages mortgage repurchase facility were required, we can give no assurance that DHI Mortgage would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nDamage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business, financial results and/or stock price.\nAdverse publicity related to our company, industry, personnel, operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment, potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Our reputation could be adversely affected by actual or perceived failures or concerns related to ethics, compliance, product quality and safety, environmental matters, privacy, diversity and inclusion, human rights, compensation and benefits and corporate governance, among other things. Negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms, including social media, websites, blogs and newsletters. Customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction, and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize, respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment. Adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation, reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel.\nWe rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses. Specifically, our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams, our rental housing management team, our financial services management team, our corporate office management teams, our Forestar management team and our executive officers. These key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding, lot development, financial services and rental housing industries, as well as leadership and management abilities that are vital to our success. Our ability to attract and retain our key personnel may be impacted by matters involving reputation, culture, diversity and inclusion, compensation and benefits and our management of executive succession. We seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel. However, if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nWe may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations and/or divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, including with respect to our ESG efforts, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, potential homebuyers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current homebuyers, subcontractors, investors and other third parties. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nInformation technology failures, data security breaches, and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records. These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, third-party software and data storage providers and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, significant systems failures and service outages in the past. Additionally, phishing attacks, whereby perpetrators attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, vendors or other users of a companys systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to its data, have become more prevalent in recent years. The use of remote work environments and virtual platforms may increase our risk of cyber-attack or data security breaches. Further, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may create a heightened risk of cyber-attacks or other data security breaches. Our normal business activities involve collecting and storing information specific to our homebuyers, renters, employees, vendors and suppliers and maintaining operational and financial information related to our business, both in\nan office setting and remote locations as needed. A material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of this information. The unintended or unauthorized disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information as a result of a security breach by any means could lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators. The outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nWe may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures, security breaches, and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the future as legal requirements continue to increase. The European Union and other international regulators, as well as state governments, have enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (and its successor the California Privacy Rights Act which will go into effect on January 1, 2023), and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections. These regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems, including notifying individuals regarding information we have collected from them. We have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these requirements, but our costs may increase significantly if new requirements are enacted and based on how individuals exercise their rights. Any noncompliance could result in substantial penalties, reputational damage or litigation.\nWe provide employee awareness training about cybersecurity threats. We routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems, and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data. We use various encryption, tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, they often are not recognized until launched against a target. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures or to identify and investigate cybersecurity incidents.\nAlthough past cybersecurity incidents have not had a material effect on our business or operations to date, in the future a data security breach, a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations, damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. We cannot provide assurances that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur homebuilding and lot development operations own inventories of land, lots and homes, and our rental operations own rental properties that are both completed and under construction as part of the ordinary course of our business. We also own office buildings totaling approximately 1.6 million square feet, and we lease approximately 730,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring through September 2027. These properties are located in our various operating markets to house our homebuilding, Forestar, financial services and rental operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices.\nWe own ranch land and improvements totaling 93,600 acres, most of which has been owned for over 20 years. We use this land to conduct ranching and agricultural activities and to host company meetings and events. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.\nWith respect to administrative or judicial proceedings involving the environment, we have determined that we will disclose any such proceeding if we reasonably believe such proceeding will result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, at or in excess of $1 million. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol DHI. As of November 10, 2022, the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE was $83.92, and there were approximately 274 holders of record.\nIn October 2022, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, payable on December 12, 2022, to stockholders of record on December 2, 2022. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.\nWe may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time pursuant to our $1.0 billion common stock repurchase authorization, which was approved by our Board of Directors effective April 20, 2022, and which replaced our prior $1.0 billion common stock repurchase authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. During fiscal 2022, we purchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion. All share repurchases were made in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). We intend to use a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act at any time we seek to repurchase shares during a self-imposed trading blackout period. At September 30, 2022, our remaining stock repurchase authorization was $438.3 million.

ITEM 6. [Reserved] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote an understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section discusses the results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to 2021. For similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2021 results compared to our fiscal 2020 results, refer to Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on November 18, 2021.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption Forward-Looking Statements and under Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nResults of Operations - Overview\nFiscal 2022 Operating Results\nIn fiscal 2022, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 1% and 20%, respectively, compared to the prior year, and our consolidated revenues increased 21% to $33.5 billion compared to $27.8 billion in the prior year. Our pre-tax income was $7.6 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2021, and our pre-tax operating margin was 22.8% compared to 19.3%. Net income was $5.9 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2021, and our diluted earnings per share was $16.51 compared to $11.41.\nConsolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $561.8 million in fiscal 2022 and $534.4 million in fiscal 2021, and cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, our return on equity (ROE) was 34.5% compared to 31.6% in fiscal 2021, and our homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 42.8% compared to 37.9%. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the year divided by average stockholders equity, where average stockholders equity is the sum of ending stockholders equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the year divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2022 and for most of the third quarter, demand for our homes remained strong. In June 2022, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that persisted through the end of our fiscal year as mortgage interest rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated. The supply of homes at affordable price points remains limited across most of our markets, and disruptions in the supply chains for certain building materials and tightness in the labor market have caused our construction cycle to lengthen. Although these pressures may persist for some time, we believe we are well-positioned to meet these changing market conditions with our affordable product offerings and lot supply, and we will manage our home pricing, sales incentives and number of homes in inventory based on the level of homebuyer demand.\nWithin our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled through purchase contracts represent 77% of the lots owned and controlled at September 30, 2022 compared to 76% at September 30, 2021. Our relationship with Forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to significantly increase the controlled portion of our lot pipeline over the past few years.\nWe believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.\nStrategy\nOur operating strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions. Our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives:\nDeveloping and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.\nMaintaining a significant cash balance and strong overall liquidity position while controlling our level of debt.\nAllocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.\nOffering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.\nModifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.\nDelivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.\nManaging our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\nInvesting in lots, land and land development in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.\nContinuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts with Forestar and other land developers.\nControlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.\nImproving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.\nControlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production levels.\nEnsuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.\nInvesting in the construction and leasing of single-family and multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.\nOpportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operating platform.\nWe believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions and maintain our strong financial performance and competitive position. However, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions.\nKey Results\nKey financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, were as follows:\nHomebuilding:\nHomebuilding revenues increased 20% to $31.9 billion compared to $26.6 billion.\nHomes closed increased 1% to 82,744 homes, and the average closing price of those homes increased 19% to $385,100.\nNet sales orders decreased 6% to 76,137 homes, while the value of net sales orders increased 9% to $30.4 billion.\nSales order backlog decreased 25% to 19,614 homes, and the value of sales order backlog decreased 16% to $8.0 billion.\nHome sales gross margin was 28.7% compared to 25.5%.\nHomebuilding SG&A expense was 6.8% of homebuilding revenues compared to 7.3%.\nHomebuilding pre-tax income was $6.9 billion compared to $4.8 billion.\nHomebuilding pre-tax income was 21.7% of homebuilding revenues compared to 18.1%.\nHomebuilding return on inventory was 42.8% compared to 37.9%.\nNet cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion compared to $1.2 billion.\nHomebuilding cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion.\nHomebuilding inventories totaled $17.3 billion compared to $13.9 billion.\nHomes in inventory totaled 46,400 compared to 47,800.\nOwned lots totaled 131,100 compared to 127,800, and lots controlled through purchase contracts increased to 442,100 from 402,500.\nHomebuilding debt was $2.9 billion compared to $3.2 billion.\nHomebuilding debt to total capital was 13.2% compared to 17.8%, and net homebuilding debt to total capital was 4.4% compared to 1.7%.\nForestar:\nForestars revenues increased 15% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.3 billion.

These reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states:\nNorthwest: Colorado, Oregon, Utah and Washington\nSouthwest: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada and New Mexico\nSouth Central: Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas\nSoutheast: Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi\nEast: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee\nNorth: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska,\nNew Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia\nThe following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nNet Sales Orders (1)\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet Homes Sold Value (In millions) Average Selling Price\n2022 2021 %\nChange 2022 2021 %\nChange 2022 2021 %\nChange\nNorthwest 4,509 4,530 - % $ 2,566.5 $ 2,320.2 11 % $ 569,200 $ 512,200 11 %\nSouthwest 8,111 9,456 (14) % 4,235.5 4,179.3 1 % 522,200 442,000 18 %\nSouth Central 21,417 23,631 (9) % 7,409.8 6,992.9 6 % 346,000 295,900 17 %\nSoutheast 21,649 24,239 (11) % 8,193.6 7,632.1 7 % 378,500 314,900 20 %\nEast 13,479 14,038 (4) % 5,059.7 4,496.9 13 % 375,400 320,300 17 %\nNorth 6,972 5,484 27 % 2,908.5 2,126.8 37 % 417,200 387,800 8 %\n76,137 81,378 (6) % $ 30,373.6 $ 27,748.2 9 % $ 398,900 $ 341,000 17 %\n._____________\n(1)Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.\nSales Order Cancellations\nYear Ended September 30,\nCancelled Sales Orders Value (In millions) Cancellation Rate (1)\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nNorthwest 845 583 $ 468.2 $ 294.2 16 % 11 %\nSouthwest 2,485 1,497 1,190.8 598.0 23 % 14 %\nSouth Central 6,866 5,301 2,343.8 1,510.2 24 % 18 %\nSoutheast 5,612 5,356 2,006.3 1,585.1 21 % 18 %\nEast 2,913 3,136 1,055.5 947.6 18 % 18 %\nNorth 1,384 986 564.2 354.6 17 % 15 %\n20,105 16,859 $ 7,628.8 $ 5,289.7 21 % 17 %\n_____________\n(1)Cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\nNet Sales Orders\nThe number of net sales orders decreased 6% during 2022 compared to 2021, and the value of net sales orders increased 9% to $30.4 billion (76,137 homes) in 2022 from $27.7 billion (81,378 homes) in 2021 due to the increase in our average selling price. The average selling price of net sales orders during fiscal 2022 was $398,900, up 17% from the prior year.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2022 and for most of the third quarter, demand for our homes remained strong. We restricted our sales order pace during the year in most of our communities to match our longer construction cycles, which have resulted from disruptions in the supply chains for certain building materials and tightness in the labor market. In June 2022, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that persisted through the end of our fiscal year as mortgage interest rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated. Our net sales order volume decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, and the average selling price of net sales orders declined by 4% sequentially in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Although these pressures may persist for some time, we believe we are well-positioned to meet these changing market conditions with our affordable product offerings.\nIn regions with a decrease in sales order volume, the markets contributing most to the decreases were: the Arizona and California markets in the Southwest; the Austin market in the South Central; the Louisiana markets in the Southeast; and the Atlanta market in the East. In the North region, the markets contributing most to the increase in sales order volume were the Chicago, Indianapolis, New Jersey and Iowa markets.\nOur sales order cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 21% in 2022 compared to 17% in 2021. The increase in the cancellation rate primarily reflects the moderation in demand we experienced beginning in June 2022 as mortgage rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 32%, up sequentially from 24% in the third quarter.\nSales Order Backlog\nAs of September 30,\nHomes in Backlog Value (In millions) Average Selling Price\n2022 2021 %\nChange 2022 2021 %\nChange 2022 2021 %\nChange\nNorthwest 724 954 (24) % $ 427.1 $ 497.7 (14) % $ 589,900 $ 521,700 13 %\nSouthwest 1,760 3,438 (49) % 905.0 1,495.9 (40) % 514,200 435,100 18 %\nSouth Central 5,692 8,733 (35) % 2,051.7 2,825.4 (27) % 360,500 323,500 11 %\nSoutheast 6,983 7,319 (5) % 2,787.3 2,534.7 10 % 399,200 346,300 15 %\nEast 3,086 4,217 (27) % 1,214.8 1,469.4 (17) % 393,600 348,400 13 %\nNorth 1,369 1,560 (12) % 589.1 640.0 (8) % 430,300 410,300 5 %\n19,614 26,221 (25) % $ 7,975.0 $ 9,463.1 (16) % $ 406,600 $ 360,900 13 %\nSales Order Backlog\nSales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations.\nHomes Closed and Revenue\nYear Ended September 30,\nHomes Closed Home Sales Revenue (In millions) Average Selling Price\n2022 2021 %\nChange 2022 2021 %\nChange 2022 2021 %\nChange\nNorthwest 4,739 5,120 (7) % $ 2,637.1 $ 2,515.6 5 % $ 556,500 $ 491,300 13 %\nSouthwest 9,789 9,760 - % 4,826.4 4,024.7 20 % 493,000 412,400 20 %\nSouth Central 24,458 22,236 10 % 8,183.5 6,104.2 34 % 334,600 274,500 22 %\nSoutheast 21,985 23,842 (8) % 7,941.0 7,066.1 12 % 361,200 296,400 22 %\nEast 14,610 14,678 - % 5,314.2 4,453.9 19 % 363,700 303,400 20 %\nNorth 7,163 6,329 13 % 2,959.5 2,338.1 27 % 413,200 369,400 12 %\n82,744 81,965 1 % $ 31,861.7 $ 26,502.6 20 % $ 385,100 $ 323,300 19 %\nHome Sales Revenue\nRevenues from home sales increased 20% to $31.9 billion (82,744 homes closed) in 2022 from $26.5 billion (81,965 homes closed) in 2021. Although our homes closed during the year were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions, home sales revenues increased in all of our regions due to an increase in average selling price.\nThe number of homes closed in 2022 increased 1% from 2021. In regions with an increase in closings volume, the markets contributing most to the increases were: the Dallas market in the South Central and the Chicago and New Jersey markets in the North. In regions with a decrease in closings volume, the markets contributing most to the decreases were: the Seattle market in the Northwest and the Orlando market in the Southeast.\nHomebuilding Operating Margin Analysis\nPercentages of Related Revenues\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nGross profit - home sales 28.7 % 25.5 %\nGross profit - land/lot sales and other 36.3 % 25.1 %\nInventory and land option charges (0.2) % (0.1) %\nGross profit - total homebuilding 28.5 % 25.4 %\nSelling, general and administrative expense 6.8 % 7.3 %\nOther (income) expense (0.1) % - %\nHomebuilding pre-tax income 21.7 % 18.1 %\nHome Sales Gross Profit\nGross profit from home sales increased to $9.1 billion in 2022 from $6.8 billion in 2021 and increased 320 basis points to 28.7% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 340 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost of those homes, partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 20 basis points.\nWe remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. To adjust to market conditions, we increased our use of incentives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and our home sales gross profit margin declined sequentially by 180 basis points from 30.1% in the third quarter to 28.3% in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2023, we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives and also expect our average sales price to decrease, which will cause our gross profit margins to decline from current levels.\nLand/Lot Sales and Other Revenues\nLand/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $61.4 million and $75.0 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of September 30, 2022, our homebuilding operations had $29.4 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.\nInventory and Land Option Charges\nAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As a result of these reviews, there were no impairments recorded in our homebuilding segment during the three months ended September 30, 2022 or during fiscal 2022. There were $5.6 million of homebuilding impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2021.\nAs we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in impairment charges, which could be significant.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $57.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense\nSG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 12% to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2022 from $1.9 billion in fiscal 2021. SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 6.8% and 7.3% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEmployee compensation and related costs were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing 82% and 81% of SG&A costs in those years. These costs increased 13% in fiscal 2022 from the prior year period. Our homebuilding operations employed 9,499 and 8,429 people at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe attempt to control our homebuilding SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.\nInterest Incurred\nWe capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred by our homebuilding operations was $110.7 million and $93.6 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest charged to cost of sales was 0.6% and 0.7% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in those years.\nOther Income\nOther income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $16.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 2021. Other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.\nHomebuilding Results by Reporting Region\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nHomebuilding\nRevenues Homebuilding\nPre-tax\nIncome (1) % of\nRevenues Homebuilding\nRevenues Homebuilding\nPre-tax\nIncome (1) % of\nRevenues\n(In millions)\nNorthwest $ 2,658.4 $ 560.8 21.1 % $ 2,516.6 $ 510.8 20.3 %\nSouthwest 4,840.7 968.3 20.0 % 4,071.0 653.1 16.0 %\nSouth Central 8,192.3 1,910.7 23.3 % 6,111.2 1,150.2 18.8 %\nSoutheast 7,951.2 1,918.5 24.1 % 7,079.6 1,371.9 19.4 %\nEast 5,318.1 1,126.3 21.2 % 4,459.0 795.1 17.8 %\nNorth 2,962.4 456.3 15.4 % 2,340.2 331.7 14.2 %\n$ 31,923.1 $ 6,940.9 21.7 % $ 26,577.6 $ 4,812.8 18.1 %\n________\n(1)Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office.

At the time of purchase, the undeveloped land is generally vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\nOur homebuilding segments inventories at September 30, 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nConstruction in Progress and\nFinished Homes Residential Land/Lots Developed\nand Under Development Land Held\nfor Development Land Held\nfor Sale Total Inventory\n(In millions)\nNorthwest $ 854.9 $ 945.1 $ - $ 2.2 $ 1,802.2\nSouthwest 1,328.7 1,447.2 7.2 18.6 2,801.7\nSouth Central 2,304.9 1,625.4 0.3 1.1 3,931.7\nSoutheast 2,692.7 1,385.2 13.2 - 4,091.1\nEast 1,389.3 1,153.4 - - 2,542.7\nNorth 1,251.9 676.7 - 7.1 1,935.7\nCorporate and unallocated (1)\n129.1 89.5 0.3 0.4 219.3\n$ 9,951.5 $ 7,322.5 $ 21.0 $ 29.4 $ 17,324.4\nSeptember 30, 2021\nConstruction in Progress and\nFinished Homes Residential Land/Lots Developed\nand Under Development Land Held\nfor Development Land Held\nfor Sale Total Inventory\n(In millions)\nNorthwest $ 609.6 $ 685.4 $ - $ 12.5 $ 1,307.5\nSouthwest 1,113.5 1,315.8 6.9 9.4 2,445.6\nSouth Central 1,977.4 1,501.5 0.4 - 3,479.3\nSoutheast 2,002.4 1,160.1 16.1 - 3,178.6\nEast 1,124.6 792.3 1.3 1.4 1,919.6\nNorth 901.4 460.4 5.3 1.8 1,368.9\nCorporate and unallocated (1)\n119.1 88.5 0.4 0.3 208.3\n$ 7,848.0 $ 6,004.0 $ 30.4 $ 25.4 $ 13,907.8\n_____________\n(1)Corporate and unallocated inventory consists primarily of capitalized interest and property taxes.\nOur land and lot position and homes in inventory at September 30, 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLand/Lots\nOwned (1)\nLots Controlled Through\nLand and Lot Purchase\nContracts (2)(3) Total Land/Lots\nOwned and\nControlled Homes in\nInventory (4)\nNorthwest 11,100 32,200 43,300 2,900\nSouthwest 22,100 36,500 58,600 4,900\nSouth Central 37,800 66,500 104,300 12,400\nSoutheast 24,700 138,600 163,300 14,200\nEast 22,700 105,700 128,400 6,800\nNorth 12,700 62,600 75,300 5,200\n131,100 442,100 573,200 46,400\n23 % 77 % 100 %\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLand/Lots\nOwned (1)\nLots Controlled Through\nLand and Lot Purchase\nContracts (2)(3) Total Land/Lots\nOwned and\nControlled Homes in\nInventory (4)\nNorthwest 9,000 31,400 40,400 2,600\nSouthwest 22,800 34,300 57,100 5,500\nSouth Central 42,800 79,000 121,800 14,000\nSoutheast 26,700 125,500 152,200 13,600\nEast 17,300 83,100 100,400 7,300\nNorth 9,200 49,200 58,400 4,800\n127,800 402,500 530,300 47,800\n24 % 76 % 100 %\n_________________________\n(1)Land/lots owned included approximately 37,600 and 30,800 owned lots that are fully developed and ready for home construction at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The total remaining purchase price of lots controlled through land and lot purchase contracts at September 30, 2022 and 2021 included $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, related to lot purchase contracts with Forestar, secured by $131.7 million and $151.0 million, respectively, of earnest money. Our lots controlled under land and lot purchase contracts include approximately 4,077 lots at September 30, 2022, representing lots controlled under contracts for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the underlying contracts have yet to be terminated. We have reserved the deposits related to these contracts if the deposits are not refundable.\n(3)Lots controlled at September 30, 2022 included approximately 36,700 lots owned or controlled by Forestar, 17,800 of which our homebuilding divisions have under contract to purchase and 18,900 of which our homebuilding divisions have a right of first offer to purchase. Of these, approximately 14,100 lots were in our Southeast region, 6,800 lots were in our East region, 6,200 lots were in our South Central region, 4,900 lots were in our Southwest region, 3,900 lots were in our North region and 800 lots were in our Northwest region. Lots controlled at September 30, 2021 included approximately 39,200 lots owned or controlled by Forestar, 21,000 of which our homebuilding divisions had under contract to purchase and 18,200 of which our homebuilding divisions had a right of first offer to purchase.\n(4)Approximately 27,200 and 21,700 of our homes in inventory were unsold at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022, approximately 4,400 of our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 90 homes had been completed for more than six months. At September 30, 2021, approximately 900 of our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 100 homes had been completed for more than six months. Homes in inventory exclude approximately 1,800 model homes at both September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nResults of Operations - Forestar\nIn fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar and at September 30, 2022, we owned 63% of its outstanding shares. Forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 53 markets across 21 states as of September 30, 2022. Forestars segment results are presented on their historical cost basis, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance. (See Note B to the accompanying financial statements for additional Forestar segment information.)\nResults of operations for the Forestar segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nTotal revenues $ 1,519.1 $ 1,325.8\nCost of land/lot sales and other 1,182.7 1,093.6\nInventory and land option charges 12.4 3.0\nTotal cost of sales 1,195.1 1,096.6\nSelling, general and administrative expense 93.6 68.4\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - 18.1\nOther (income) expense (5.4) (3.9)\nIncome before income taxes $ 235.8 $ 146.6\nRevenues are primarily derived from sales of single-family residential lots to local, regional and national homebuilders. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, Forestars land and lot sales, including the portion sold to D.R. Horton and the revenues generated from those sales, were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n($ in millions)\nTotal residential single-family lots sold 17,691 15,915\nResidential single-family lots sold to D.R. Horton 14,895 14,839\nResidential lot sales revenues from sales to D.R. Horton $ 1,231.8 $ 1,206.5\nTract acres sold to D.R. Horton - 85\nTract sales revenues from sales to D.R. Horton $ - $ 25.9\nSG&A expense for fiscal 2022 and 2021 included charges of $4.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to the shared services agreement between Forestar and D.R. Horton whereby D.R. Horton provides Forestar with certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt of $18.1 million in fiscal 2021 was due to Forestars redemption of its $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due 2024 in May 2021.\nAt September 30, 2022, Forestar owned directly or controlled through land and lot purchase contracts approximately 90,100 residential lots, of which 5,500 are fully developed. Approximately 36,700 of these lots are under contract to sell to D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement with D.R. Horton, and 1,400 of these lots are under contract to sell to other builders.\nResults of Operations - Financial Services\nThe following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising DHI Mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 % Change\nNumber of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R. Horton homebuyers 57,355 54,694 5 %\nNumber of homes closed by D.R. Horton 82,744 81,965 1 %\nPercentage of D.R. Horton homes financed by DHI Mortgage 69 % 67 %\nNumber of total loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R. Horton homebuyers 57,414 54,767 5 %\nTotal number of loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage 58,298 56,054 4 %\nCaptive business percentage 98 % 98 %\nLoans sold by DHI Mortgage to third parties 57,213 54,977 4 %\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 % Change\n(In millions)\nLoan origination and other fees $ 52.3 $ 48.1 9 %\nGains on sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights 561.7 619.1 (9) %\nServicing income 3.4 3.6 (6) %\nTotal mortgage operations revenues 617.4 670.8 (8) %\nTitle policy premiums 177.6 152.8 16 %\nTotal revenues 795.0 823.6 (3) %\nGeneral and administrative expense 547.6 488.3 12 %\nOther (income) expense (43.2) (29.3) 47 %\nFinancial services pre-tax income $ 290.6 $ 364.6 (20) %\nFinancial Services Operating Margin Analysis\nPercentages of\nFinancial Services Revenues\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nGeneral and administrative expense 68.9 % 59.3 %\nOther (income) expense (5.4) % (3.6) %\nFinancial services pre-tax income 36.6 % 44.3 %\nMortgage Loan Activity\nThe volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. In fiscal 2022, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 5% from the prior year due to an increase in the percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled our homebuyers financing.\nHomes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in both fiscal 2022 and 2021. This percentage reflects DHI Mortgages consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.\nThe number of loans sold increased 4% in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year. Virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on September 30, 2022 were eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. During fiscal 2022, approximately 62% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 30% were sold to one other major financial entity. Changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.\nFinancial Services Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues from our mortgage operations decreased 8% to $617.4 million in fiscal 2022 from $670.8 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to a more competitive environment in the mortgage industry due to rising interest rates. Revenues from our title operations increased 16% to $177.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $152.8 million in fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average premium collected on closing transactions from higher sales prices of homes closed by our homebuilding operations, as well as expansion of our title insurance operations.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expense related to our financial services operations increased 12% to $547.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $488.3 million in the prior year. As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense was 68.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to 59.3% in the prior year. Fluctuations in financial services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned. Our financial services operations employed 3,024 and 2,891 people at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.\nPrimarily as a result of the reduction in revenue and operating margin of our mortgage operations, pre-tax income from our financial services operations decreased 20% to $290.6 million in fiscal 2022 from $364.6 million in fiscal 2021.\nResults of Operations - Rental\nOur rental segment consists of multi-family and single-family rental operations. The multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties, with a primary focus on constructing garden style multi-family rental communities typically accommodating 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets. The single-family rental operations primarily construct and lease single-family homes within a community and then market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. Multi-family and single-family rental property sales are recognized as revenues, and rental income is recognized as other income. Results of operations for the rental segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nRevenues\nSingle-family rental $ 313.8 $ 75.9\nMulti-family rental and other 196.4 191.9\nTotal revenues 510.2 267.8\nCost of sales\nSingle-family rental 147.8 42.4\nMulti-family rental and other 96.4 119.1\nTotal cost of sales 244.2 161.5\nSelling, general and administrative expense 91.1 44.6\nOther (income) expense (27.1) (24.8)\nIncome before income taxes $ 202.0 $ 86.5\nAt September 30, 2022, our rental property inventory of $2.6 billion included $1.7 billion of inventory related to our single-family rental operations and $897.2 million of inventory related to our multi-family rental operations. At September 30, 2021, our rental property inventory of $840.9 million included $415.8 million of assets related to our single-family rental operations and $425.1 million of assets related to our multi-family rental operations.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we sold 774 single-family rental homes for $313.8 million compared to 257 homes sold for $75.9 million in fiscal 2021. At September 30, 2022, we had single-family rental properties consisting of 7,400 homes, of which 3,530 were completed, and 6,680 lots, of which 1,770 were finished. At September 30, 2021, we had single-family rental properties consisting of 1,895 homes, of which 895 homes were completed, and 3,930 lots, of which 760 were finished.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we sold 775 multi-family rental units for $195.5 million compared to 959 units sold for $191.9 million in fiscal 2021. At September 30, 2022, we had multi-family rental properties consisting of 5,810 units under active construction and 300 units that were substantially complete and in the lease-up phase. At September 30, 2021, we had multi-family rental properties consisting of 4,340 units under active construction and 350 units that were substantially complete and in the lease-up phase.\nResults of Operations - Other Businesses\nIn addition to our homebuilding, Forestar, financial services and rental operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, own water rights and other water-related assets, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate energy-related assets. The pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $58.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $32.7 million in fiscal 2021.\nIn May 2022, we acquired Vidler Water Resources, Inc. (Vidler) for a total purchase price of $290.5 million. The assets acquired through the Vidler transaction consisted primarily of water rights and other water-related assets.\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nIncome before Income Taxes\nPre-tax income was $7.6 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased average selling prices and an increase in home sales gross margin. In fiscal 2022, our homebuilding, financial services, Forestar and rental businesses generated pre-tax income of $6.9 billion, $290.6 million, $235.8 million and $202.0 million, respectively, compared to $4.8 billion, $364.6 million, $146.6 million and $86.5 million, respectively, in fiscal 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense was $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 22.7% and 21.8% in those years. The effective tax rates for both years include an expense for state income taxes and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and federal energy efficient homes tax credits.\nThe federal energy efficient homes tax credit was retroactively extended to qualifying homes closed from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2032 as a result of the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Beginning with homes closed after December 31, 2022, the requirements to qualify for the energy efficient homes tax credit will be increased. We are currently analyzing the impact of the increased requirements on our ability to qualify homes for the credit. Other tax related provisions of the IRA, including the corporate alternative minimum tax, had no material impact on our financial statements and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements in the future.\nOur deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $159.0 million at September 30, 2022 compared to $159.5 million at September 30, 2021. We have a valuation allowance of $17.9 million and $4.2 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to deferred tax assets for state net operating loss (NOL), state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire before being realized. Of the $17.9 million valuation allowance, $15.8 million relates to state NOL, state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards acquired in the Vidler acquisition. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL, state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.\nWe have $30.9 million of tax benefits for a federal NOL carryforward acquired in the Vidler acquisition. The utilization of the federal NOL is subject to IRC Section 382 limitations; however, it is expected that all of the federal NOL will be utilized within the carryforward period. D.R. Horton has $12.0 million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction. Of the total amount, $4.3 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining $7.7 million expire from fiscal years 2033 to 2042. Forestar has $1.2 million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nThe accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in our financial statements. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $2.9 million at both September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nD.R. Horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for D.R. Hortons major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. An audit by the Internal Revenue Service of a federal refund claim related to the retroactive extension of energy efficient homes tax credits for fiscal 2018 and additional energy efficient tax credits for fiscal 2017 was completed during the current fiscal year with no material adjustments. D.R. Horton is under audit by various states; however, we are not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities.\nForestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for Forestars federal income tax remains open for examination for tax years 2019 through 2022. The statute of limitations for Forestars major state tax jurisdictions generally remain open for examination for tax years 2017 through 2022. Forestar is not currently under audit for federal or state income taxes.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nWe have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions.\nWe have continued to increase our investments in homebuilding inventories and single-family and multi-family rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability. We are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. We are maintaining significant homebuilding cash balances and liquidity to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had outstanding notes payable with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of $6.1 billion, of which $2.5 billion is payable within 12 months and includes $1.6 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility. Future interest payments associated with the notes total $507.6 million, of which $215.8 million is payable within 12 months.\nAt September 30, 2022, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders equity plus notes payable) was 23.8% compared to 26.7% at September 30, 2021. Our net debt to total capital (notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders equity plus notes payable net of cash) was 15.4% at September 30, 2022 compared to 12.9% at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 13.2% compared to 17.8% at September 30, 2021. Our net homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders equity plus homebuilding notes payable net of cash) was 4.4% at September 30, 2022 compared to 1.7% at September 30, 2021. Over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 30%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 30% throughout fiscal 2023. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of Forestar, DRH Rental and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit of $273.3 million and surety bonds of $2.8 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party guarantees.\nWe regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash and liquidity levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in July 2021, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in October 2021, registering $750 million of equity securities, of which $300 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program that became effective in November 2021. At September 30, 2022, $748.2 million remained available for issuance under Forestars shelf registration statement, of which $298.2 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Resources - Homebuilding\nCash and Cash Equivalents - At September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $2.0 billion.\nBank Credit Facility - We have a $2.19 billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $3.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the total revolving credit commitments. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. Borrowings and repayments under the facility totaled $3.45 billion each during fiscal 2022. At September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding and $220 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $1.97 billion.\nIn October 2022, our senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to October 28, 2027.\nOur homebuilding revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facility.\nPublic Unsecured Debt - We have $2.8 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2022 that mature from February 2023 through October 2027. The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.\nOur homebuilding revolving credit facility and senior notes are guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc.s significant wholly-owned homebuilding subsidiaries.\nDebt and Stock Repurchase Authorizations - In July 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities. In April 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, replacing the prior stock repurchase authorization. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion. At September 30, 2022, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining, and $438.3 million of the stock repurchase authorization was remaining. These authorizations have no expiration date.\nCapital Resources - Forestar\nThe achievement of Forestars long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing and generate sufficient cash flows from operations. As market conditions permit, Forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity. At September 30, 2022, Forestars ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders equity plus notes payable) was 37.1% compared to 41.0% at September 30, 2021. Forestars ratio of net debt to total capital (notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders equity plus notes payable net of cash) was 26.9% compared to 35.2% at September 30, 2021.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - At September 30, 2022, Forestar had cash and cash equivalents of $264.8 million.\nBank Credit Facility - Forestar has a $410 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $600 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of Forestars real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding and $53.3 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $356.7 million.\nIn October 2022, Forestars senior unsecured revolving credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to October 28, 2026.\nThe Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.\nUnsecured Debt - As of September 30, 2022, Forestar had $700 million principal amount of senior notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which represent unsecured obligations of Forestar. These notes include $400 million principal amount of 3.85% senior notes that mature in May 2026 and $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes that mature in March 2028.\nForestars revolving credit facility and its senior notes are guaranteed by Forestars wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. They are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, financial services or rental operations. At September 30, 2022, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.\nDebt Repurchase Authorization - In April 2020, Forestars Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of Forestars debt securities. All of the $30 million authorization was remaining at September 30, 2022, and the authorization has no expiration date.\nIssuance of Common Stock - During fiscal 2022, Forestar issued 84,547 shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program for proceeds of $1.7 million, net of commissions and other issuance costs totaling $0.1 million. At September 30, 2022, $748.2 million remained available for issuance under Forestars shelf registration statement, of which $298.2 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program.\nCapital Resources - Financial Services\nCash and Cash Equivalents - At September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services segment totaled $103.3 million.\nMortgage Repurchase Facility - Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. The total capacity of the facility is $1.6 billion; however, the capacity automatically increases during certain higher volume periods and can be further increased through additional commitments. The total capacity of the facility at September 30, 2022 was $2.2 billion, and its maturity date is February 17, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2022, $2.5 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $2.4 billion were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $827.2 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $1.6 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2022 at a 4.6% annual interest rate.\nThe mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, Forestar or rental operations. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiarys minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable leverage ratio and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At September 30, 2022, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.\nIn the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.\nCapital Resources - Rental\nCash and Cash Equivalents - At September 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of our rental segment totaled $109.9 million. During fiscal 2022, we continued to increase the investment in our rental operations. The inventory in our rental segment totaled $2.6 billion at September 30, 2022 compared to $840.9 million at September 30, 2021.\nBank Credit Facility - In March 2022, our rental subsidiary, DRH Rental, entered into a $625 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. On subsequent occasions, DRH Rental utilized the accordion feature to obtain additional commitments, thereby increasing the size of the facility to $975 million at September 30, 2022. Availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of DRH Rentals real estate assets and unrestricted cash. At September 30, 2022, the borrowing base limited the available capacity under the facility to $811.9 million. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. The maturity date of the facility is March 4, 2026. At September 30, 2022, there were $800 million of borrowings outstanding at a 4.8% annual interest rate and no letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in available capacity of $11.9 million.\nIn November 2022, DRH Rental utilized the accordion feature and increased the size of the revolving credit facility to $1.025 billion through an additional commitment.\nThe revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require DRH Rental to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. At September 30, 2022, DRH Rental was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility.\nDRH Rentals revolving credit facility is guaranteed by DRH Rentals wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. The rental revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, Forestar or financial services operations.\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nIn fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $561.8 million compared to $534.4 million in fiscal 2021. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year primarily consisted of $1.9 billion and $108.7 million of cash provided by our homebuilding and Forestar segments, respectively, partially offset by $1.4 billion and $10.5 million of cash used in our rental and financial services segments, respectively. The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.\nCash used to increase construction in progress and finished home inventory was $2.1 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2021. The increase is due to increased home construction costs and more homes in inventory that were complete or closer to completion at the end of the current year. Cash used to increase residential land and lots was $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2021. Of these amounts, $142.3 million and $585.6 million, respectively, related to Forestar.\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash used to increase our single-family and multi-family rental properties totaled $1.7 billion and is reflected as cash used in operating activities. During fiscal 2021, cash used to increase our single-family and multi-family rental properties totaled $477.5 million, of which $173.9 million related to the first half of the year and is presented as cash used in investing activities and $303.6 million related to the second half of the year and is presented as cash used in operating activities.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nIn fiscal 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $414.9 million compared to $252.2 million in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, uses of cash included the acquisition of Vidler Water Resources, Inc. for $271.5 million, net of the cash acquired, and purchases of property and equipment totaling $148.2 million. In fiscal 2021, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental operations totaling $173.9 million, the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes for $23.0 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $93.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a single-family rental community for $31.8 million.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nWe expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for our operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.\nIn fiscal 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $811.2 million, consisting primarily of repayments of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling $3.5 billion, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $1.1 billion, repayment of $350 million principal amount of our 4.375% homebuilding senior notes at maturity and payment of cash dividends totaling $316.5 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by draws on our homebuilding revolving credit facility of $3.5 billion, draws on DRH Rentals revolving credit facility of $800 million and net advances on our mortgage repurchase facility of $123.7 million.\nIn fiscal 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $85.1 million, consisting primarily of repayment of $400 million principal amount of our 2.55% homebuilding senior notes at maturity, Forestars redemption of its $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $848.4 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $289.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds from our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 1.4% homebuilding senior notes and $600 million principal amount of 1.3% homebuilding senior notes, Forestars issuance of $400 million principal amount of 3.85% senior notes and net advances of $362.0 million on our mortgage repurchase facility.\nOur Board of Directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in fiscal 2022 and $0.20 per common share in fiscal 2021. In October 2022, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, payable on December 12, 2022, to stockholders of record on December 2, 2022. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nAs of September 30, 2022, D.R. Horton, Inc. had $2.8 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding due through October 2027 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facility.\nAll of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of D.R. Horton, Inc. (Guarantors or Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by D.R. Horton, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with the Forestar lot development operations, financial services operations, multi-family and single-family rental operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facility (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Guarantors.\nThe guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another Guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.\nThe enforceability of the obligations of the Guarantor Subsidiaries under their guarantees may be subject to review under applicable federal or state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. In certain circumstances, a court could void the guarantees, subordinate amounts owing under the guarantees or order other relief detrimental to the holders of our guaranteed obligations. The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a savings clause, which limits the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such Guarantors obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.\nD.R.

The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding, lot development, financial services and rental operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition - We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWhen we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.\nForestars land and lot sales revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to a third-party buyer. Forestars revenues from land and lot sales to D.R. Horton are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe rarely purchase unimproved land for resale, but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that do not fit into our strategic operating plans. Revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. Revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. We typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. We sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.\nMortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. Based on historical experience, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated, discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.\nInventories and Cost of Sales - Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction. Costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.\nLand and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity.\nWhen a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. We record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.\nAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. We generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale, rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. A particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. In reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:\ngross margins on homes closed in recent months;\nprojected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;\nprojected gross margins based on community budgets;\nprojected gross margins of rental property sales;\ntrends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;\nsales absorption rates; and\nperformance of other communities in nearby locations.\nIf indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:\nsupply and availability of new and existing homes;\nlocation and desirability of our communities;\nvariety of product types offered in the area;\npricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;\nalternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;\namount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub-market; and\nlocal economic and demographic trends.\nFor those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.\nWe rarely purchase land for resale. However, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. If the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThe key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. Although our quarterly assessments reflect managements best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nWarranty Claims - We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. Since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The amounts charged are based on managements estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. Our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. For additional information regarding our warranty liability, see Note L, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nLegal Claims and Insurance - We are named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. We have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. Approximately 99% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nOur reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had reserves for approximately 560 and 380 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During fiscal 2022, we were notified of approximately 355 new construction defect claims and resolved 175 construction defect claims for a total cost of $24.4 million. We have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.\nHistorical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. We also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.\nWe estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. However, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, we anticipate we will largely be self-insured. Additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.\nThe estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. A 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $133.8 million in our reserves and a $46.9 million increase in our insurance receivable, resulting in additional expense of $86.9 million. A 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $120.4 million in our reserves and a $49.5 million decrease in our insurance receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $70.9 million. For additional information regarding our legal claims reserves, see Note L, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nPending Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform - Scope, which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. We will adopt these standards when LIBOR is discontinued and do not expect them to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, which requires application of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. ASU 2021-08 creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in ASC 805 and will result in recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. Except in very limited circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of MBS, which are referred to as hedging instruments in the following discussion. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third-party purchasers. The hedging instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge, with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Hedging instruments related to funded, uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value, with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, along with changes in the fair value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans. The net fair value change, which for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2022, hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled a notional amount of $5.4 billion. Uncommitted IRLCs totaled a notional amount of approximately $4.0 billion and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately $1.6 billion at September 30, 2022.\nWe also use hedging instruments as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to our homebuyers. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had MBS totaling $532.4 million and $834.6 million, respectively, that did not yet have IRLCs or closed loans created or assigned and recorded an asset of $4.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the fair value of such MBS position.\nThe following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2022. Because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days, its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented. The interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at September 30, 2022.\nFiscal Year Ending September 30, Fair Value at September 30, 2022\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total\n($ in millions)\nDebt:\nFixed rate $ 855.1 $ 12.9 $ 500.4 $ 900.4 $ 600.4 $ 800.0 $ 3,669.2 $ 3,291.0\nAverage interest rate 5.2 % 4.0 % 2.7 % 3.4 % 1.5 % 3.0 % 3.3 %\nVariable rate $ 1,618.3 $ - $ - $ 800.0 $ - $ - $ 2,418.3 $ 2,418.3\nAverage interest rate 4.6 % - % - % 4.8 % - % - % 4.7 % ITEM 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nEstimation of reserves for construction defect matters\nDescription of the Matter At September 30, 2022, the Companys reserve for legal claims related to construction defect matters was $724.8 million. As explained in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has established reserves for construction defect matters based on the estimated costs of pending legal claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future legal claims related to previously closed homes, and this liability is included within the accrued expenses and other liabilities account in the consolidated balance sheet. This reserve estimate is subject to a high degree of variability and ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Management applies judgment in determining the key assumptions used in calculating the reserve for construction defect matters.\nAuditing the reserve for construction defect matters is complex and especially challenging due to the judgmental nature of the key assumptions related to projections of the frequency of future claims and the costs to resolve claims in consideration of historical claims information. These assumptions are developed by management, are subjective in nature and have a significant effect on the determined amount of the reserve for construction defect matters.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys process for estimating the reserve for construction defect matters. We tested the Companys controls that address the risk of material misstatement related to the measurement and valuation of the reserve for construction defect matters, including the key assumptions related to the projections of the frequency and costs of future claims, and the completeness and accuracy of data used in the model developed by management.\nTo test the reserve for construction defect matters, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, the key assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in developing the reserve estimate. As management utilizes historical trends of frequency of claims incurred and the average cost to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where the Company operates in measuring the reserve estimate, we evaluated managements methodology for determining the frequency and cost of future claims assumptions by comparing these key assumptions to trends observed in historical Company claims data and other available information. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist with our procedures. Our specialist developed a range of values for the reserve estimate based on independently selected assumptions, which we compared to managements recorded amount to evaluate managements estimate. We also performed sensitivity analyses to determine the effect of changes in assumptions, where appropriate. We also tested completeness and accuracy of underlying claims data used in managements estimation calculations and performed recalculations to evaluate the accuracy of the model used by management to determine the estimate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 18, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, total equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated November 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 18, 2022\nD.R.

HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries, which are collectively referred to as the Company, unless the context otherwise requires. Noncontrolling interests represent the proportionate equity interests in consolidated entities that are not 100% owned by the Company. As of September 30, 2022, the Company owns a 63% controlling interest in Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar) and therefore is required to consolidate 100% of Forestar within its consolidated financial statements, and the 37% interest the Company does not own is accounted for as noncontrolling interests. All intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nHomebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. The Companys performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Proceeds from home closings held for the Companys benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWhen the Company executes sales contracts with its homebuyers, or when it requires advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are recorded as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. The Company either retains or refunds to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.\nForestars land and lot sales revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to a third-party buyer. Forestars revenues from land and lot sales to D.R. Horton are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company rarely purchases unimproved land for resale, but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that do not fit into its strategic operating plans. Revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Companys rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential multi-family and single-family rental properties. Revenue is recognized from the sale of these properties on the closing date, which is when performance obligations are satisfied. Rental income from these properties is recognized as other income.\nFinancial services revenues associated with the Companys title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. Revenues associated with the Companys mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. The Company typically elects the fair value option for its mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\naccounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. The Company sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Proceeds from home closings held for the Companys benefit at title companies, which totaled $494.8 million and $478.9 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCash balances of the Companys captive insurance subsidiary, which are expected to be used to fund the subsidiarys operations and pay future anticipated legal claims, were $64.4 million and $55.9 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company has cash that is restricted as to its use. Restricted cash related to homebuilding and land development operations includes customer deposits that are temporarily restricted in accordance with regulatory requirements. Restricted cash related to financial services is mortgagor related funds held by the Company for taxes and insurance on an interim basis until the loans are sold.\nInventories and Cost of Sales\nInventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction. Costs incurred after projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.\nLand and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity. Development and construction costs incurred related to the rental operations are recorded as rental property inventory. Cost of sales related to the rental operations include the specific construction costs and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs for each rental project.\nWhen a home is closed, the Company generally has not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. A liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales are recorded for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. Home construction budgets are compared to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home.\nThe Company rarely purchases land for resale. However, when the Company owns land or communities under development that do not fit into its development and construction plans, and the Company determines that it will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. The Company records land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAt the end of each quarter, the Company reviews the performance and outlook for all of its communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, the Company performs an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The Companys estimate of undiscounted cash flows from communities analyzed may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value. There are several factors which could lead to changes in the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for a given community. The most significant of these includes pricing and incentive levels actually realized by the community, the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and construct the homes. Pricing and incentive levels are often interrelated with sales pace in a community, such that a price reduction is typically expected to increase the sales pace. Further, both of these factors are heavily influenced by the competitive pressures facing a given community from both new and existing homes. If conditions in the broader economy, homebuilding industry or specific markets in which the Company operates worsen, and as the Company evaluates specific community pricing and incentives, construction and development plans, and its overall land sale strategies, it may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. This may result in impairment charges which could be significant.\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes, impairment charges are also recorded. The key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. See Note C.\nCapitalized Interest\nThe Company capitalizes interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. During periods in which the Companys active inventory is lower than its debt level, a portion of the interest incurred is reflected as interest expense in the period incurred. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Companys active inventory exceeded its debt level, and all interest incurred was capitalized to inventory. See Note E.\nLand and Lot Purchase Contracts\nThe Company enters into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Under these contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of many of the purchase contracts, the deposits are not refundable in the event the Company elects to terminate the contract. Land purchase contract deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when the Company believes it is probable that it will not acquire the property under contract and will not be able to recover these costs through other means. See Notes C and L.\nVariable Interests\nLand purchase contracts can result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under contract. There was one variable interest entity consolidated for $64.3 million in the Companys balance sheet at September 30, 2022 because the Company determined it controlled the activities that most significantly impacted the variable interest entitys economic performance. There were no variable interest entities consolidated in the Companys balance sheet at September 30, 2021.\nThe maximum exposure to losses related to the Companys unconsolidated variable interest entities is limited to the amounts of the Companys related deposits. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the deposits related to these contracts totaled $1.5 billion and $870.2 million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The depreciable life of model home furniture is 2 years, depreciable lives of other furniture and equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years, and depreciable lives of buildings and improvements typically range from 5 to 30 years. See Note F.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and the Companys estimates of significant assumptions that a market participant would use when determining fair value. While the Company believes the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nIn April 2022, the Company and Vidler Water Resources, Inc. (Vidler) entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which the Company would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Vidler for $15.75 per share in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, in May 2022, the Company completed a tender offer and acquired all of the outstanding shares for a total purchase price of $290.5 million. There was no goodwill recorded as a result of this transaction.\nThe Companys allocation of the purchase price to the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest acquired is as follows (in millions):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 19.0\nDeferred income taxes, net of valuation allowance of $15.8 million\n14.8\nWater rights and other water-related assets (1)\n280.1\nTotal assets 313.9\nOther liabilities 5.4\nTotal liabilities 5.4\nNoncontrolling interest 18.0\nNet assets acquired $ 290.5\n_____________________________________\n(1)Water rights and other water-related assets were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs and are included in other assets in the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nThe Company records goodwill associated with its acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill balances are evaluated for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment indicates that additional impairment testing is required, then a quantitative assessment is performed to determine the operating segments fair value. The estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to present value. If the carrying value\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nof the operating segment exceeds its fair value, the Company records a goodwill impairment by the amount that an operating segments carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As a result of the qualitative assessments performed in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, no impairment charges were indicated or recorded.\nThe Companys goodwill balances by reporting segment were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nNorthwest $ 2.2 $ 2.2\nSouthwest - -\nSouth Central 15.9 15.9\nSoutheast 6.0 6.0\nEast 60.5 60.5\nNorth 49.7 49.7\nForestar 29.2 29.2\nTotal goodwill $ 163.5 $ 163.5\nWarranty Claims\nThe Company provides its homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. Since the Company subcontracts its construction work to subcontractors who typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The amounts charged are based on managements estimate of the warranty-related costs expected to be incurred in the future. The Companys warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic areas in which they are built. See Note L.\nLegal Claims and Insurance\nThe Company records expenses and liabilities for legal claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. The amounts recorded for these contingencies are based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. The Company estimates and records receivables under its applicable insurance policies for these legal claims when recovery is probable. However, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, the Company anticipates it will largely be self-insured. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when the Company has been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies. See Note L.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $41.7 million, $36.1 million and $41.7 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Companys income tax expense is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nlosses and tax credit carryforwards. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company records a valuation allowance when it determines it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note H.\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in the Companys income tax expense in the period in which the change is made. The Companys unrecognized tax benefits totaled $2.9 million at both September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities outstanding during each year. See Note I.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Companys stockholders formally authorize shares of its common stock to be available for future grants of stock-based compensation awards. From time to time, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors authorizes the grant of stock-based compensation to its employees and directors from these available shares. At September 30, 2022, the outstanding stock-based compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units. Grants of restricted stock units vest over a certain number of years as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Restricted stock units outstanding at September 30, 2022 have a remaining vesting period up to 4.5 years. Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of the Companys common stock at the date of the grant. All stock options outstanding at September 30, 2022 have vested and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.\nThe compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of restricted stock units are based on the Companys stock price on the date of grant. The fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. See Note K.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value. The Company considers the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with the Companys counterparties when determining the fair value measurements, if applicable. Fair value measurements are used for the Companys mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories, other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value is not recoverable. See Note N.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nPending Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform - Scope, which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. The Company will adopt these standards when LIBOR is discontinued and does not expect them to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, which requires application of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. ASU 2021-08 creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in ASC 805 and will result in recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, and it is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNOTE B - SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Companys operating segments are its 78 homebuilding divisions, its majority-owned Forestar residential lot development operations, its financial services operations, its rental operations and its other business activities. The Companys reporting segments are its homebuilding reporting segments, its Forestar lot development segment, its financial services segment and its rental operations segment.\nHomebuilding\nThe homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments. The reporting segments and the states in which the Company has homebuilding operations are as follows:\nNorthwest: Colorado, Oregon, Utah and Washington\nSouthwest: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada and New Mexico\nSouth Central: Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas\nSoutheast: Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi\nEast: Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee\nNorth: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska,\nNew Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia\nHomebuilding is the Companys core business, generating 95%, 96% and 97% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Companys homebuilding divisions are primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of land and the construction and sale of residential homes, with operations in 106 markets across 33 states. Most of the revenue generated by the Companys homebuilding operations is from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots.\nForestar\nThe Forestar segment is a residential lot development company with operations in 53 markets across 21 states. The Companys homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. Forestars segment results are presented on their historical cost basis, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance.\nFinancial Services\nThe Companys financial services segment provides mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of the Companys homebuilding markets. The segment generates the substantial majority of its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services. The Company sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers.\nRental\nThe Companys rental segment consists of multi-family and single-family rental operations. The multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties. The single-family rental operations primarily construct and lease single-family homes within a community and then market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes.\nOther\nIn addition to its homebuilding, Forestar, financial services and rental operations, the Company engages in other business activities through its subsidiaries. The Company conducts insurance-related operations, owns water rights and other water-related assets, owns non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and owns and operates energy-related assets. The results of these operations are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented in the Eliminations and Other column in the tables that follow.\nD.R.

These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreement governing the facility and the indentures governing the senior notes also impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens.

The homebuilding senior notes and borrowings under the homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed by entities that hold approximately 76% of the Companys assets. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Company and a ratings downgrade event, as defined in the indentures governing its senior notes, the Company would be required in certain circumstances to offer to repurchase these notes at 101% of their principal amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest. Also, a change of control as defined in the revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of any borrowings outstanding under the facility and the termination of the commitments thereunder.\nThe Companys homebuilding revolving credit facility and the homebuilding senior notes are guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc.s significant wholly-owned homebuilding subsidiaries.\nIn July 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Companys debt securities. The authorization has no expiration date. All of the $500 million authorization was remaining at September 30, 2022.\nD.R. HORTON, INC.

The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly.

HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNOTE G - MORTGAGE LOANS\nMortgage Loans Held for Sale and Related Derivatives\nMortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property. The Company typically sells the servicing rights for the majority of loans when the loans are sold. Servicing rights retained are typically sold within six months of loan origination. At September 30, 2022, mortgage loans held for sale of $2.39 billion had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $2.51 billion. At September 30, 2021, mortgage loans held for sale of $2.03 billion had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.97 billion. During the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, mortgage loans originated totaled $19.5 billion, $16.0 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, and mortgage loans sold totaled $18.9 billion, $15.5 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively. The Company had gains on sales of loans and servicing rights of $561.7 million, $619.1 million and $437.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net gains on sales of loans and servicing rights are included in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2022, approximately 62% of the Companys mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 30% were sold to one other major financial entity.\nTo manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage operations, the Company hedges its risk using derivative instruments, generally forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are referred to as hedging instruments in the following discussion. The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nNewly originated loans that have been closed but not committed to third-party purchasers are hedged to mitigate the risk of changes in their fair value. Hedged loans are committed to third-party purchasers typically within three days after origination. The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge mortgage loans held for sale may vary in relationship to the underlying loan amounts, depending on the movements in the value of each hedging instrument relative to the value of the underlying mortgage loans. The fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the mortgage loans held for sale. The net fair value change, which for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was not significant, is recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Companys mortgage loans held for sale that were not committed to third-party purchasers totaled $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nThe Company also uses hedging instruments as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to its homebuyers. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had MBS totaling $532.4 million and $834.6 million, respectively, that did not yet have interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) or closed loans created or assigned and recorded an asset of $4.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, for the fair value of such MBS position.\nLoan Commitments and Related Derivatives\nThe Company is party to IRLCs, which are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of IRLCs, which are accounted for as derivative instruments recorded at fair value, totaled $4.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.\nThe Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments and hedging instruments. These instruments are considered derivatives in an economic hedge and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments totaled $23.5 million and $88.8 million, respectively, and the notional amount of hedging instruments related to the remaining IRLCs totaled $3.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOther Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves\nMortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions derived from industry-standard representations and warranties in the relevant agreements. These representations and warranties primarily involve the absence of misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties, the appropriate underwriting of the loan and in some cases, a required minimum number of payments to be made by the borrower. The Company generally does not retain any other continuing interest related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. The majority of other mortgage loans consists of loans repurchased due to these limited recourse obligations. Typically, these loans are impaired, and some result in real estate owned through the foreclosure process. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Companys total other mortgage loans and real estate owned, before loss reserves, totaled $14.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively.\nThe Company has recorded reserves for estimated losses on other mortgage loans, real estate owned and future loan repurchase obligations due to the limited recourse provisions, all of which are recorded as reductions of revenue. The loss reserve for loan repurchase and settlement obligations is estimated based on historical experience, analysis of the volume of mortgages originated, discussions with mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests. The reserve balances at September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled $7.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively.\nOther mortgage loans and real estate owned net of the related loss reserves are included in other assets, while loan repurchase obligations are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nD.R.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a reduction for a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against the Companys state deferred tax assets.\nThe federal energy efficient homes tax credit was retroactively extended to qualifying homes closed from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2032 as a result of the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was signed into law on August 16, 2022.

Components of deferred income taxes are summarized as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nInventory costs $ 74.0 $ 63.5\nInventory impairments 9.5 12.7\nWarranty and construction defect costs 239.5 190.5\nNet operating loss carryforwards 44.1 11.7\nTax credit carryforwards 6.4 1.6\nIncentive compensation plans 84.7 77.5\nOther 12.7 15.6\nTotal deferred tax assets 470.9 373.1\nValuation allowance (17.9) (4.2)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 453.0 368.9\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDeferral of profit on home closings 209.4 166.7\nDepreciation of fixed assets 30.5 14.4\nDeferral of income 18.5 2.0\nUndistributed earnings of subsidiary 27.3 10.2\nOther 26.2 20.3\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 311.9 213.6\nDeferred income taxes, net $ 141.1 $ 155.3\nThe Company has $30.9 million of tax benefits for a federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward acquired in the Vidler acquisition. The utilization of the federal NOL is subject to IRC Section 382 limitations; however, it is expected that all of the federal NOL will be utilized within the carryforward period. D.R. Horton has $12.0 million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction. Of the total amount, $4.3 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining $7.7 million expire from fiscal years 2033 to 2042. Forestar has $1.2 million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction.\nThe accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of the Companys deferred tax assets.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nValuation Allowance\nThe Company has a valuation allowance of $17.9 million and $4.2 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to deferred tax assets for state NOL, state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire before being realized. Of the $17.9 million valuation allowance, $15.8 million relates to state NOL, state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards acquired in the Vidler acquisition. The Company will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to the remaining state NOL, state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact the Companys effective tax rate.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nUnrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nUnrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 2.9 $ 8.9\nAdditions attributable to tax positions taken in the current year - 1.5\nAdditions attributable to tax positions taken in prior years - -\nSettlements - (7.5)\nUnrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 2.9 $ 2.9\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $2.9 million. The Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2022. The Company classifies interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense.\nRegulations and Legislation\nD.R. Horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for D.R. Hortons major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. An audit by the Internal Revenue Service of a federal refund claim related to the retroactive extension of energy efficient homes tax credits for fiscal 2018 and additional energy efficient tax credits for fiscal 2017 was completed during the current fiscal year with no material adjustments. D.R. Horton is under audit by various states; however, the Company is not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities.\nForestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for Forestars federal income tax remains open for examination for tax years 2019 through 2022.

HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNOTE K - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company offers its employees a comprehensive compensation and benefits package, which includes a broad range of benefits, including medical, dental and vision healthcare insurance and paid parental leave. In addition to base pay, eligible employees may participate in the Companys 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, short-term incentive bonus program and/or its stock compensation plans, as described below.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company has a 401(k) plan for all employees who have been with the Company for a period of six months or more. The Company matches portions of employees voluntary contributions. The Company recorded $35.4 million, $30.3 million and $23.4 million of expense for matching contributions in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Companys Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) is a non-qualified deferred compensation program that provides benefits payable to certain management employees upon retirement, death or termination of employment. Under the SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit based on a percentage of the eligible employees salaries, as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined formula. The Companys liabilities related to the SERP were $52.1 million and $50.4 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recorded $7.7 million, $7.0 million and $6.5 million of expense for this plan in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a select group of employees which allows participating employees to contribute compensation into the plan on a before tax basis and defer income taxation on the contributions until the funds are withdrawn from the plan. The participating employees designate investments for their contributions; however, the Company is not required to invest the contributions in the designated investments. The Companys net liabilities related to the deferred compensation plan were $119.5 million and $124.5 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company records as expense the amount that the employee contributions would have earned had the funds been invested in the designated investments. Related to this plan, the Company recorded a credit to expense of $24.0 million in fiscal 2022 and recorded charges to expense of $21.7 million and $5.3 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company at a discounted price of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the designated dates of purchase. The price to eligible employees may be further discounted depending on the average fair market value of the stock during the period and certain other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the total fair market value of common stock that an eligible employee may purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the employees annual compensation or $25,000. Under the plan, employees purchased 164,193 shares for $10.7 million in fiscal 2022, 112,995 shares for $7.5 million in fiscal 2021 and 131,348 shares for $5.6 million in fiscal 2020. At September 30, 2022, the Company had 2.6 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nIncentive Bonus Plan\nThe Companys Incentive Bonus Plan provides for the Compensation Committee to award short-term performance bonuses to senior management based upon the level of achievement of certain criteria. For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Compensation Committee approved awards whereby certain executive officers could earn performance bonuses based upon percentages of the Companys pre-tax income. Compensation expense related to these plans was $40.5 million, $61.6 million and $34.3 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Companys Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock options and restricted stock units to executive officers, other key employees and non-management directors. Restricted stock unit (RSU) awards may be based on service over a requisite time period (time-based) or on performance (performance-based). RSU equity awards represent the contingent right to receive one share of the Companys common stock per RSU if the vesting conditions and/or performance criteria are satisfied. The RSUs have no dividend or voting rights until vested. At September 30, 2022, the Company had 8.5 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance and 4.2 million shares available for future grants under the Stock Incentive Plan.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Unit Equity Awards\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, time-based RSUs were granted to the Companys executive officers, other key employees and non-management directors (collectively, approximately 1,200, 1,030 and 960 recipients, respectively). These awards vest annually in equal installments over periods of three to five years.\nThe following table provides additional information related to time-based RSU activity during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The number of RSUs vested includes shares of common stock withheld by the Company on behalf of employees to satisfy the tax withholding requirements.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNumber of\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair Value Number of\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair Value Number of\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at beginning of year 3,817,265 $ 46.16 4,725,701 $ 34.79 4,889,534 $ 33.01\nGranted 1,153,124 74.96 856,615 83.13 1,657,935 35.98\nVested (1,402,642) 41.44 (1,644,263) 33.26 (1,651,840) 30.85\nCancelled (101,653) 51.22 (120,788) 39.16 (169,928) 33.24\nOutstanding at end of year 3,466,094 $ 57.50 3,817,265 $ 46.16 4,725,701 $ 34.79\nThe total fair value of shares vested on the vesting date during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $120.1 million, $131.3 million and $95.6 million, respectively. For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, compensation expense related to time-based RSUs was $63.6 million, $56.5 million and $50.6 million, respectively. At September 30, 2022, there was $147.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested time-based RSU awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Equity Awards\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, performance-based RSU equity awards that vest at the end of three-year performance periods were granted to the Companys executive officers. The number of units that ultimately vest depends on the Companys relative position as compared to its peers in achieving certain performance criteria and can range from 0% to 200% of the number of units granted. The performance criteria are total shareholder return, return on investment, SG&A expense containment and gross profit. Compensation expense related to these grants is based on the Companys performance against its peer group, the elapsed portion of the performance period and the grant date fair value of the award.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table provides additional information related to the performance-based RSUs outstanding at September 30, 2022.\nGrant Date Vesting Date Target Number of Performance Units Grant Date Fair Value per Unit Compensation Expense\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n(In millions)\nNovember 2019 September 2022 360,000 $ 52.54 $ 8.6 $ 10.1 $ 9.3\nNovember 2020 September 2023 360,000 70.60 12.5 12.5 -\nOctober 2021 (1) September 2024 430,000 80.58 14.3 - -\n$ 35.4 $ 22.6 $ 9.3\n_________________________\n(1)The performance RSUs granted in October 2021 totaled 390,000; however, in March 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved an amendment and restatement of this award to increase the RSUs granted from 390,000 to 430,000. Concurrent with this change, the Compensation Committee amended the executive officer short-term performance bonus plan to reduce the amount of the award that could be earned.\nIn October 2022, the Compensation Committee approved the issuance of the performance-based RSUs that vested in September 2022 in the form of 585,000 shares of common stock to satisfy the awards.\nStock Options\nStock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of the Companys common stock at the date of the grant. The options outstanding at September 30, 2022 are all exercisable and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.\nThe Company did not grant stock options during fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the option exercise price.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2022 was $35.8 million. Exercise prices for options outstanding at September 30, 2022 ranged from $23.57 to $23.86. The weighted average remaining contractual lives of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2022 is 1.1 years.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNOTE L - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWarranty Claims\nThe Company provides its homebuyers with warranties for defects in structural elements, mechanical systems and other construction components of the home. Warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered based on managements estimate of expected warranty-related costs and by accruing for existing warranty claims. The Companys warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic areas in which they are built. The estimation of these costs is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties related to these factors. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing the liability for warranty claims, actual future costs could differ significantly from current estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of its warranty liability.\nChanges in the Companys warranty liability during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nWarranty liability, beginning of year $ 376.3 $ 310.2\nWarranties issued 185.8 154.5\nChanges in liability for pre-existing warranties 15.1 3.8\nSettlements made (122.9) (92.2)\nWarranty liability, end of year $ 454.3 $ 376.3\nLegal Claims and Insurance\nThe Company is named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, the Company is managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. The Company has established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. The estimated liabilities for these contingencies were $729.1 million and $577.5 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Approximately 99% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both September 30, 2022 and 2021. Expenses related to the Companys legal contingencies were $138.0 million, $72.4 million and $64.4 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Companys reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. As of September 30, 2022, no individual existing claim was material to the Companys financial statements. The Company has closed a significant number of homes during recent years and may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which the Company operates. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where the Company operates are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nHistorical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and the Company believes they may continue to fluctuate. The Company also believes that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from the Companys home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change the Companys estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed the Companys current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on its future earnings and liquidity.\nChanges in the Companys legal claims reserves during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n(In millions)\nReserves for legal claims, beginning of year $ 577.5 $ 473.8\nIncrease in reserves 186.1 131.8\nPayments (34.5) (28.1)\nReserves for legal claims, end of year $ 729.1 $ 577.5\nIn the majority of states in which it operates, the Company generally has, and requires the majority of the subcontractors it uses to have, general liability insurance which includes construction defect coverage. The Companys general liability insurance policies protect it against a portion of its risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and lawsuits. The Company estimates and records receivables under these policies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. However, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, the Company anticipates it will largely be self-insured. The Companys estimated insurance receivables from estimated losses for pending legal claims and anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes totaled $137.9 million and $109.5 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when the Company has been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.\nIn some states where the Company believes it is too difficult or expensive for its subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, the Company has waived its normal subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower costs from subcontractors. In these states, the Company purchases insurance policies from either third-party carriers or its wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and names certain subcontractors as additional insureds. The policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiary and the policies issued on or after June 1, 2020 by third-party carriers essentially represent self-insurance of these risks by the Company.\nThe Company is self-insured for the deductible amounts under its workers compensation insurance policies. The deductibles vary by policy year, but in no years exceed $0.5 million per occurrence. The deductible for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 policy years is $0.5 million per occurrence.\nThe estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to the Companys markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of its reserves.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nLand and Lot Purchase Contracts\nThe Company enters into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. At September 30, 2022, the Company had total deposits of $1.6 billion, consisting of cash deposits of $1.5 billion and promissory notes and surety bonds of $90.5 million, related to contracts to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately $19.7 billion. The majority of land and lots under contract are currently expected to be purchased within three years. Of these amounts, $131.7 million of the deposits related to contracts with Forestar to purchase land and lots with a remaining purchase price of $1.4 billion. A limited number of the homebuilding land and lot purchase contracts at September 30, 2022, representing $88.9 million of remaining purchase price, were subject to specific performance provisions that may require the Company to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their respective contractual obligations. Of the $88.9 million remaining purchase price subject to specific performance provisions, $66.2 million related to contracts between the homebuilding segment and Forestar.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, Forestar reimbursed the homebuilding segment $8.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively, for previously paid earnest money and $58.9 million and $61.3 million, respectively, for pre-acquisition and other due diligence costs related to land purchase contracts whereby the homebuilding segment assigned its rights under contract to Forestar.\nOther Commitments\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $2.8 billion and letters of credit of $273.3 million to secure performance under various contracts. Of the total letters of credit, $220.0 million were issued under the homebuilding revolving credit facility and $53.3 million were issued under Forestars revolving credit facility.\nThe Company leases office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.

The fair value hierarchy and its application to the Companys assets and liabilities is as follows:\nLevel 1 - Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company does not currently have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2 - Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market. The Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs on a recurring basis are as follows:\n\u25e6Mortgage loans held for sale - The fair value of these loans is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. Closed mortgage loans are typically sold shortly after origination, which limits exposure to nonperformance by loan buyer counterparties to a short time period. In addition, the Company actively monitors the financial strength of its counterparties.\n\u25e6IRLCs - The fair value of IRLCs is calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. These valuations do not contain adjustments for expirations as any expired commitments are excluded from the fair value measurement. The Company generally only issues IRLCs for products that meet specific purchaser guidelines. Should any purchaser become insolvent, the Company would not be required to close the transaction based on the terms of the commitment. Since not all IRLCs will become closed loans, the Company adjusts its fair value measurements for the estimated amount of IRLCs that will not close.\n\u25e6Loan sale commitments and hedging instruments - The fair values of best-efforts and mandatory loan sale commitments and derivative instruments such as forward sales of MBS that are utilized as hedging instruments are calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets. The Company mitigates exposure to nonperformance risk associated with derivative instruments by limiting the number of counterparties and actively monitoring their financial strength and creditworthiness. Further, the Companys derivative contracts typically have short-term durations with maturities from one to four months. Accordingly, the Companys risk of nonperformance relative to its derivative positions is not significant.\nThe Companys assets measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs on a nonrecurring basis are a limited number of mortgage loans held for sale with some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value. When available, fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in the secondary markets for such assets.\nAfter consideration of nonperformance risk, no additional adjustments were made to the fair value measurements of mortgage loans held for sale, IRLCs or hedging instruments.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nLevel 3 - Valuation is typically derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on the Companys own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.\nThe Companys assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs on a recurring basis are its mortgage servicing rights and a limited number of mortgage loans held for sale with some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and for which reference to quoted prices in the secondary markets is not available.\nThe Companys assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs that are typically reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value on a nonrecurring basis are as follows:\n\u25e6Inventory held and used - In assessing impairment indicators of its inventory held and used, the Company performs an analysis of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets. The most significant factors used to estimate undiscounted future cash flows include pricing and incentive levels actually realized by the community, the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and construct the homes. Inventory held and used measured at fair value represents those communities for which the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than their carrying amounts and therefore, the Company recorded impairments during the period to record the inventory at fair value calculated based on its discounted estimated future cash flows.\n\u25e6Inventory available for sale - The factors considered in determining fair values of the Companys land held for sale primarily include actual sale contracts and recent offers received from outside third parties, and may also include prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and other market analysis. If the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the assets current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\n\u25e6Certain mortgage loans held for sale - A limited number of mortgage loans held for sale have some degree of impairment affecting their marketability. For some of these loans, quoted prices in the secondary market are not available and therefore, a cash flow valuation model is used to determine fair value.\n\u25e6Certain other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned - Other mortgage loans include performing and nonperforming mortgage loans, which often become real estate owned through the foreclosure process. The fair values of other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned are determined based on the Companys assessment of the value of the underlying collateral or the value of the property, as applicable. The Company uses different methods to assess the value of the properties, which may include broker price opinions, appraisals or cash flow valuation models.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following tables summarize the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets during fiscal 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value at September 30, 2022\nBalance Sheet Location Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In millions)\nMortgage loans held for sale (1) Mortgage loans held for sale $ - $ 2,356.1 $ 14.1 $ 2,370.2\nMortgage servicing rights (2) Other assets - - 10.6 10.6\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments (3):\nInterest rate lock commitments (4) Other assets and other liabilities - (135.8) - (135.8)\nMortgage hedging instruments and commitments (5) Other assets and other liabilities - 317.8 - 317.8\nFair Value at September 30, 2021\nBalance Sheet Location Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In millions)\nMortgage loans held for sale (1) Mortgage loans held for sale $ - $ 2,009.4 $ 11.7 $ 2,021.1\nMortgage servicing rights (2) Other assets - - 4.1 4.1\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments (3):\nInterest rate lock commitments (4) Other assets and other liabilities - 17.2 - 17.2\nMortgage hedging instruments and commitments Other assets - 8.5 - 8.5\nLevel 3 Assets at Fair Value for the Year Ended September 30, 2022\nBalance at\nSeptember 30, 2021 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) Purchases / Originations Sales and Settlements Principal Reductions Net transfers to (out of) Level 3 Balance at\nSeptember 30, 2022\n(In millions)\nMortgage loans held for sale (1)\n$ 11.7 $ (0.7) $ - $ (3.9) $ - $ 7.0 $ 14.1\nMortgage servicing rights (2) 4.1 (1.2) 35.3 (27.6) - - 10.6\nLevel 3 Assets at Fair Value for the Year Ended September 30, 2021\nBalance at\nSeptember 30, 2020 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) Purchases / Originations Sales and Settlements Principal Reductions Net transfers to (out of) Level 3 Balance at\nSeptember 30, 2021\n(In millions)\nDebt securities collateralized by residential real estate\n$ 3.9 $ - $ - $ (3.9) $ - $ - $ -\nMortgage loans held for sale (1)\n15.1 0.3 - (3.3) - (0.4) 11.7\nMortgage servicing rights (2) 17.1 (0.2) 24.7 (37.5) - - 4.1\n___________________________________________\n(1)The Company typically elects the fair value option upon origination for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for sale is based on contractual interest rates and included in other income. Mortgage loans held for sale valued using Level 3 inputs at September 30, 2022 and 2021 include $14.1 million and $11.7 million, respectively, of loans for which the Company elected the fair value option upon origination and did not sell into the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale totaling $7.0 million were transferred to Level 3 during fiscal 2022 due to significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of these loans. The fair value of these mortgage loans held for sale is generally calculated considering pricing in the secondary market and adjusted for the value of the underlying collateral, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. The Company plans to sell these loans as market conditions permit. Mortgage loans totaling $0.4 million were transferred to Level 2 during fiscal 2021 because their fair value was based on actual quoted prices related to the pending sale of those loans in the secondary market.\n(2)Although the majority of the Companys mortgage loans are sold on a servicing-released basis, when the servicing rights are retained, the Company records them at fair value using third-party valuations. The valuation at the time the servicing asset is retained is reflected in the purchases/originations column with subsequent changes in value classified as realized and unrealized gains (losses). The key assumptions used in the valuation, which are generally unobservable inputs, are mortgage prepayment rates, discount rates and delinquency rates, which were 12%, 11% and 8%, respectively, at September 30, 2022.\nD.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(3)Fair value measurements of these derivatives represent changes in fair value, as calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets, and are reflected in the balance sheet as other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The net fair value change in fiscal 2022 and 2021 recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations was not significant.\n(4)The fair value of interest rate lock commitments at September 30, 2022 reflects $47.7 million of servicing release premiums in other assets and a change in fair value of $183.5 million in other liabilities. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments at September 30, 2021 reflects $17.9 million of servicing release premiums in other assets and a change in fair value of $0.7 million in other liabilities.\n(5)The fair value of mortgage hedging instruments and commitments at September 30, 2022 reflects a $330.2 million change in fair value in other assets and a $12.4 million change in fair value in other liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value at September 30,\nBalance Sheet Location 2022 2021\nLevel 2 Level 3 Level 2 Level 3\n(In millions)\nMortgage loans held for sale (1) (2)\nMortgage loans held for sale $ - $ 15.8 $ - $ 3.8\nOther mortgage loans (1) (3)\nOther assets - 1.5 - 1.3\n______________________\n(1)The fair values included in the table above represent only those assets whose carrying values were adjusted to fair value as a result of impairment in the respective period and were held at the end of the period.\n(2)These mortgage loans have some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and are valued at the lower of carrying value or fair value. When available, quoted prices in the secondary market are used to determine fair value (Level 2); otherwise, a cash flow valuation model is used to determine fair value (Level 3).\n(3)The fair values of other mortgage loans were determined based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nFor the financial assets and liabilities that the Company does not reflect at fair value, the following tables present both their respective carrying value and fair value at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nCarrying Value Fair Value at September 30, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents (1)\n$ 2,540.5 $ 2,540.5 $ - $ - $ 2,540.5\nRestricted cash (1)\n32.4 32.4 - - 32.4\nNotes payable (2) (3)\n6,066.9 - 3,121.7 2,587.6 5,709.3\nCarrying Value Fair Value at September 30, 2021\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents (1)\n$ 3,210.4 $ 3,210.4 $ - $ - $ 3,210.4\nRestricted cash (1)\n26.8 26.8 - - 26.8\nNotes payable (2) (3)\n5,412.4 - 3,950.9 1,589.3 5,540.2\n______________\n(1)The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.\n(2)The fair value of the senior notes is determined based on quoted prices, which is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n(3)The fair values of other secured notes and borrowings on the revolving credit facility and the mortgage repurchase facility approximate carrying value due to their short-term nature or floating interest rate terms, as applicable, and are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022 were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or otherwise provides the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, as stated in their report included herein.
