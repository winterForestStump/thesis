    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nBackground\nWe were incorporated in Colorado on January 16, 2002. In April 2012, we became active in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties.\nEffective September 2, 2016, we formally changed our name to Petrolia Energy Corporation and moved the corporation from Colorado to Texas, pursuant to the filing of a Statement of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Colorado and a Certificate of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Texas, authorized by the Plan of Conversion which was approved by our stockholders at our April 14, 2016, annual meeting of stockholders, each of which are described in greater detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2016. In addition to the Certificate of Conversion filing, we filed a Certificate of Correction filing with the Secretary of State of Texas (correcting certain errors in our originally filed Certificate of Formation) on August 24, 2016.\nPlan of Operation\nSince 2015, we have established a clearly defined strategy to acquire, enhance and redevelop high-quality, resource in place oil and gas assets. The Company has been focusing on producing assets in the United States and Canada while actively pursuing our strategy to offer low-cost operational solutions in established Oil and Gas regions. We believe our mix of oil-in-place conventional plays, low-risk resource plays and the redevelopment of our late-stage plays is a solid foundation for continued growth and future revenue growth.\nSlick Unit Dutcher Sands (SUDS) Field\nThe SUDS oilfield consists of approximately 2,604 acres located in Creek County, Oklahoma and Petrolia owns a 100% Working Interest (WI) with a 76.5% net revenue interest (NRI). Our engineering reports and analysis indicate there is still considerable recoverable reserves remaining.\nThe SUDS field is currently shut-in while awaiting sufficient capital to recomplete the wells and repair the flow lines that were damaged in a grass fire.\nTwin Lakes San Andres Unit (TLSAU) Field\nTLSAU is located 45 miles from Roswell, Chaves County, New Mexico. TLSAU is currently shut-in awaiting confirmation of lease acreage held, then capital allocation to complete some regulatory plugging requirements. The Company plugged two wells at Twin Lakes in June 2022 and is currently working on surface remediation activities.\nThe Company is reviewing strategic options with the TLSAU asset, with a bias toward divesting the asset.\nAskarii Resources, LLC\nEffective February 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding interests of Askarii Resources LLC (tax), a private Texas based oil & gas service company for the aggregate value of $50,000. The Company currently has no intent of further investing in the Askarii Resources, LLC acquisition.\nLuseland, Hearts Hill and Cuthbert fields\nOn June 29, 2018, the Company acquired a 25% working interest in approximately 41,526 acres in the Luseland, Hearts Hill, and Cuthbert fields, located in Southwest Saskatchewan and Eastern Alberta, Canada. The working interest was acquired from Blue Sky Resources (a related party). Blue Sky Resources had previously acquired an 80% working interest from Georox Resources Inc., who had acquired the Canadian Properties from Cona Resources Ltd.\nOn September 17, 2018, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Blue Sky Resources to obtain the rights to acquire an additional 3% working interest, increasing our working interest to 28%. Total consideration paid from the Company to Blue Sky Resources for the additional 3% Working Interest was $150,000.\nOn February 16, 2022, Petrolia Canada Corporation (PCC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrolia Energy Corporation (PEC), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) and Debt Settlement Agreement (DSA) with Prospera Energy, Inc. whereby PCC sold its 28% working interest in the Luseland, Hearts Hill and Cuthbert fields. The agreements were effective as of October 1, 2021.\nUtikuma Lake field\nOn May 1, 2020, Petrolia Energy Corporation acquired a 50% working interest in approximately 28,000 acres located in the Utikuma Lake area in Alberta, Canada. The property is an oil-weighted asset currently producing a total of approximately 500 bpd of light oil. The working interest was acquired from Blue Sky Resources in an affiliated party transaction as Zel C. Khan, the Companys former Chief Executive Officer, is related to the ownership of Blue Sky Resources.\nBlue Sky Resources acquired a 100% working interest in the Canadian Property from Vermilion Energy Inc. via Vermilions subsidiary Vermilion Resources. The effective date of the acquisition was May 1, 2020. The total purchase price of the property was $2,000,000 (CAD), with $1,000,000 (CAD) of that total due initially. The additional $1,000,000 (CAD) was contingent on the future price of WTI crude. At the time WTI price exceeded $50/bbl, the Company would pay an additional $750,000 (CAD). In addition, at the time WTI price exceeded $57/bbl the Company would pay an additional $250,000 (CAD) (for a cumulative contingent total of $1,000,000 (CAD)). The price of WTI crude exceeded $50/bbl on January 6, 2021 and exceeded $57/bbl on February 8, 2021. The additional payments due were netted with the accounts receivable balance from previous Joint Interest Billing statements from BSR. The total USD value of the addition was $787,250, using prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates. Included in the terms of the agreement, the Company also funded their portion of the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) bond fund requirement ($602,423 USD), necessary for the wells to continue in production after the acquisition. Additional funds ($386,989 USD) remain in the other current asset balance for future payments to BSR, related to the acquisition.\nOn June 13, 2022, a Letter Agreement was signed between Blue Sky Resources Ltd. (BSR) and Petrolia Energy Corporation whereby Petrolia Canada Corporation (PCC) will sell to BSR its 50% working interest in the Utikuma Lake oil field. See Form 8-K reference in Exhibits section below.\nThe following table shows our productive wells, developed acreage, and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2021, for the Oklahoma, New Mexico and Alberta properties:\nState/Province Productive\nWells\nDeveloped\nAcreage\nUndeveloped\nAcreage (1)\nGross Net Gross Net Gross Net\nOklahoma 2,604 2,604\nNew Mexico 31 (2) 1,080 1,080\nAlberta 28,000 14,000\n(1) Undeveloped acreage includes leasehold interests on which wells have not been drilled or completed to the point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas and oil regardless of whether the leasehold interest is classified as containing proved undeveloped reserves.\n(2) The field was shut in for repairs and remediation work for all of 2021.\nThe following table shows the status of our gross acreage as of December 31, 2021, for the Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Alberta assets:\nState/Province Held by\nProduction\nNot Held by\nProduction\nOklahoma 2,604 -\nNew Mexico 1,080 -\nAlberta 28,000 -\nLeases on acres that are Held by Production remain in force so long as oil or gas is produced from one or more wells on the particular lease. Leased acres that are not held by Production require annual rental payments to maintain the lease until the first to occur of the following: the expiration of the lease or the time that oil or gas is produced from one or more wells drilled on the leased acreage. At the time oil or gas is produced from wells drilled on the leased acreage, the lease is considered to be Held by Production.\nProved Reserves\nBelow is a table that provides historical average sales price per barrel and average production cost per barrel by geographical location and by year, for the last three (3) fiscal years.\nAverage Sales\nPrice\n(per Bbls)\n($)\nAverage\nProduction Cost\n(per Bbls)\n($)\nOil Production\n(Bbls)\nOklahoma\n(1 ) (1 ) (1 )\n38.18 319.75\n47.31 173.43\nNew Mexico\n(1 ) (1 ) (1 )\n33.31 94.16\n(1 ) (1 ) (1 )\nAlberta/ Saskatchewan\n37.62 30.71 91,917\n30.42 35.92 94,016\n57.72 47.60 97,084\n(1) Note that in 2019, no sales or production occurred for the Oklahoma and New Mexico properties, and in 2021 no sales or production occurred for the New Mexico properties.\nBelow are estimates of our cumulative net proved reserves of all fields, as of December 31, 2021, net to our interest. Our proved reserves are located in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Canada.\nEstimates of volumes of proved reserves at December 31, 2021 are presented in barrels (Bbls) for oil and, for natural gas, in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.\nOil (Bbls) Gas (Mcf)\nProved:\nDeveloped 1,442,990\n41,180\nUndeveloped -\n-\nTotal 1,442,990\n41,180\n\u25cf Bbl refers to one barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.\n\u25cf Mcf refers to one thousand cubic feet.\n\u25cf A BOE (i.e., barrel of oil equivalent) combines Bbls of oil and Mcf of gas by converting each six Mcf of gas to one Bbl of oil.\nBelow are estimates of our present value of estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves based upon the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is determined by using estimated quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on period-end economic conditions. The estimated future production is based upon benchmark prices that reflect the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-of-the-month price for oil and gas during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. The resulting estimated future cash inflows are then reduced by estimated future costs to develop and produce reserves based on period-end cost levels. No deduction has been made for depletion, depreciation or for indirect costs, such as general corporate overhead. Present values were computed by discounting future net revenues by 10% per year.\nFuture cash inflows $ 93,082,624\nDeductions (including estimated taxes) $ (47,760,263 )\nFuture net cash flow $ 45,322,361\nDiscounted future net cash flow $ 17,392,377\nMKM Engineering prepared the estimates of our proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to our leasehold interests in the United States and Canada as of December 31, 2021. Michele Mudrone was the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve report. Ms. Mudrone has more than 25 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves. MKM Engineering is an independent petroleum engineering firm that provides petroleum consulting services to the oil and gas industry. The estimates of drilled reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests are based on technical analysis conducted by engineers employed at MKM Engineering.\nMark Allen, our CEO, oversaw preparation of the reserve estimates by MKM Engineering. We do not have a reserve committee and we do not have any specific internal controls regarding the estimates of our reserves.\nOur proved reserves include only those amounts which we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices and with existing technology. Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs, regulations, technology, or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of proved reserves.\nProved reserves were estimated by performance methods, the volumetric method, analogy, or a combination of methods utilizing present economic conditions and limited to those proved reserves economically recoverable. The performance methods include decline curve analysis that utilize extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December 31, 2021, in those cases where such data was considered to be definitive.\nForecasts for future production rates are based on historical performance from wells currently on production in the region with an economic cut-off for production based upon the projected net revenue being equal to the projected operating expenses. No further reserves or valuation were given to any wells beyond their economic cut-off. Where no production decline trends have been established due to the limited historical production records from wells on the properties, surrounding wells historical production records were used and extrapolated to wells of the property. Where applicable, the actual calculated present decline rate of any well was used to determine future production volumes to be economically recovered. The calculated present rate of decline was then used to determine the present economic life of the production from the reservoir.\nFor wells currently on production, forecasts of future production rates were based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to economic depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates.\nProved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated primarily by the performance and historical extrapolation methods. Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates from those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at a date we determined to be reasonable.\nIn general, the volume of production from our oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent, we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Accordingly, volumes generated from our future activities are highly dependent upon the level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves and the costs incurred in doing so.\nGovernment Regulation\nVarious state, province and federal agencies regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas. All states and provinces in which we plan to operate impose restrictions on the drilling, production, transportation and sale of oil and natural gas.\nOur sale of oil and natural gas liquids will not be regulated and will be at market prices. The price received from the sale of these products will be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines.\nFederal, state, and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations. Most states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and the filing of reports concerning operations, and impose other requirements relating to the exploration of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and natural gas is produced from our properties. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with those laws.\nCompetition and Marketing\nWe will be faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many are very large, well established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are many companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.\nExploration for and production of oil and gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools. We will depend upon independent drilling contractors to furnish rigs, equipment, and tools to drill our wells. Higher prices for oil and gas may result in competition among operators for drilling equipment, tubular goods and drilling crews which may affect our ability to expeditiously drill, complete, recomplete and work-over wells.\nThe market for oil and gas is dependent upon several factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted. These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation. In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted that would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon crude oil or natural gas, or both. Oversupplies of natural gas can be expected to recur from time to time and may result in the gas producing wells being shut in.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has zero full-time employees and zero part-time employees, and two contractors. As of December 9, 2022, the Company has zero full-time employees and zero part-time employees, and two contractors. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results of operations. We have provided below a list of known material risk factors that should be reviewed when considering buying or selling our securities. These are not all the risks we face, and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations.\nCapital Requirements\nWe may need to raise funds from additional financing in the future to complete our business plan and may need to raise additional funding in the future to support our operations. We have no commitments for any financing and any financing commitments may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. We may have difficulty obtaining additional funding, and we may have to accept terms that would adversely affect our stockholders. For example, the terms of any future financings may impose restrictions on our right to declare dividends or on the way we conduct our business. Additionally, we may raise funding by issuing convertible notes, which if converted into shares of our common stock would dilute our then stockholders interests. If we are unable to raise additional funds, we may be forced to curtail or even abandon our business plan.\nCommodity Prices\nThe price we receive for our oil directly affects our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil is a commodity that is subject to wide price fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand. Lower prices for our oil may not only decrease our revenues but may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for oil have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production and the volume of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following: changes in global supply and demand for oil, the actions of OPEC, the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil, acts of war, inflation rates, economic growth, terrorism or political instability in oil producing countries and economic conditions.\nAccounting Rules\nAccounting rules applicable to us require that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, and other factors, we could be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Such write-downs constitute a non-cash charge to earnings. Impairment of proved properties under our full cost oil accounting method is largely driven by the present values of future net revenues of proved reserves estimated using SEC mandated 12-month un-weighted first-day-of-the-month commodity prices. No assurance can be given that we will not experience ceiling test impairments in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods taken. As a result of lower oil prices, we may also reduce our estimates of the reserve volumes that may be economically recovered, which would reduce the total value of our proved reserves.\nReserve Categories\nOur undeveloped proved reserves and developed non-producing proved reserves require additional expenditures and/or activities to convert these into producing reserves. We cannot provide assurance these expenditures will be made and that activities will be entirely successful in converting these reserves. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all our undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nReserve Replacement\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. The capital markets we have historically accessed may be constrained, but we believe we may be able to access other capital markets if the need arises. These limitations in the capital markets may affect our ability to grow and changes in our capitalization structure may significantly affect our financial risk profile. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that financing for future capital expenditures will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms.\nFuture cash flows are subject to several variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, the prices of oil and our success in developing and producing new reserves. Any reductions in our capital expenditures to stay within internally generated cash flow (which could be adversely affected by declining commodity prices) and cash on hand will make replacing produced reserves more difficult. If our cash flow from operations and cash on hand are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may be limited in our ability to access additional debt, equity, or other methods of financing on an economic or timely basis to replace our proved reserves.\nRegulatory Requirements\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA) that, among other things, require additional emissions controls to produce oil, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. For well completion operations occurring at such well sites before January 1, 2015, the final regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to completion combustion devices, such as flares, in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. Compliance with these requirements could significantly increase our costs of development and production.\nWe are required to record a liability for the present value of our asset retirement obligation (ARO) to plug and abandon inactive non-producing wells, facilities, and equipment, and to restore the land at the end of oil production operations. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated ARO in future periods. Accordingly, our estimate of future ARO could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur.\nDrilling and Well Completion Success\nOur development activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including adverse weather conditions, cost overruns, equipment shortages, geological issues, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil well does not assure us that we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells hinder our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur oil exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities which include, among other things, hydraulic fracturing, involve a variety of operating risks, including fires, explosions, blow-outs and surface craters, uncontrollable flows of oil and formation water. If we experience any of these problems, well bores, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses because of injury or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, and other environmental damage.\nAcquisition Success\nOur business strategy includes growing by making acquisitions, which may include acquisitions of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped leasehold interests. Our acquisition of oil and natural gas properties requires assessments of many factors that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the acceptable prices for available properties, amounts of recoverable reserves, estimates of future oil prices, estimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs, estimates of the costs and timing of plugging, and abandonment and estimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companys assets, personnel, and operations with our own. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management, and increase our expenses.\nIn addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following: the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations; the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies; difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel; the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales; the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired; potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or operations, or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition; and potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions.\nCapital Deployment Risk\nExploring for and developing hydrocarbon reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes us from definitively predicting the costs involved and time required to reach certain objectives. The budgeted costs of planning, drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded, and such costs can increase significantly due to various complications that may arise during the drilling and operating processes. Before a well is spud, we may incur significant geological and geophysical (seismic) costs, which are incurred whether a well eventually produces commercial quantities of hydrocarbons or is drilled at all. Exploration wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. The analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored locations or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling locations. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed and could be forced to modify our drilling plans accordingly.\nIf we decide to drill a certain location, there is a risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found or produced. We may drill or participate in new wells that are not productive. We may drill wells that are productive, but that do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover exploration, drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon-bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, resulting in a reduction in production and reserves from the well or abandonment of the well.\nWhether a well is ultimately productive and profitable depends on a number of additional factors, including the following: general economic and industry conditions, including the prices received for oil and natural gas; shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment, and qualified personnel; potential drainage by operators on adjacent properties; loss of or damage to oilfield development and service tools; problems with title to the underlying properties; increases in severance taxes; adverse weather conditions that delay drilling activities or cause producing wells to be shut down; domestic and foreign governmental regulations; and proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities. If we do not drill productive and profitable wells in the future, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe review our long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually on December 31 of each year, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. If conditions in any of the businesses in which we compete were to deteriorate, we could determine that certain of our assets were impaired and we would then be required to write-off all or a portion of our costs for such assets. Any such significant write-offs would adversely affect our balance sheet and results of operations.\nEconomic Uncertainty\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, war, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market and a volatile real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil and natural gas, declining business and consumer confidence and changing unemployment and inflation, have precipitated economic uncertainty. Concerns about global economic growth and inflation have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices.\nOur exploration and development activities are capital intensive. We may make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development, exploitation, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. Our cash on hand, our operating cash flows and future potential borrowings may not be adequate to fund our future acquisitions or future capital expenditure requirements. The rate of our future growth may be dependent, at least in part, on our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be acceptable.\nCash Management\nOur cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including: our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves; the amount of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells; the prices at which we sell our production; the costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas reserves; our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; the ability and willingness of banks to lend to us; and our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets. In addition, future events, such as terrorist attacks, wars or combat peace-keeping missions, financial market disruptions, general economic recessions, inflation, oil and natural gas industry recessions, large company bankruptcies, accounting scandals, overstated reserves estimates by major public oil companies and disruptions in the financial and capital markets have caused financial institutions, credit rating agencies and the public to more closely review the financial statements, capital structures and earnings of public companies, including energy companies. Such events have constrained the capital available to the energy industry in the past, and such events or similar events could adversely affect our access to funding for our operations in the future.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels, further develop and exploit our current properties or invest in additional exploration opportunities.\nAlternatively, a significant improvement in oil and natural gas prices or other factors could result in an increase in our capital expenditures, and we may be required to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, the sale or farm out of interests in our assets, the borrowing of funds or otherwise to meet any increase in capital needs. If we are unable to raise additional capital from available sources at acceptable terms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, future debt financings may require that a portion of our cash flows provided by operating activities be used for the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nDebt financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. If we succeed in selling additional equity securities to raise funds, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. If we choose to farm-out interests in our prospects, we may lose operating control over such prospects.\nTerrorist Attack\nWe cannot assess the extent of either the threat or the potential impact of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general, and on us in particular, either in the short-term or in the long-term. Uncertainty surrounding such hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, and gathering systems, production facilities, processing plants and refineries, could be targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, a cyber-attack or electronic security breach, or an act of war.\nProduction Growth\nIn addition, there is an inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations, some of which may be material, due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, our emissions to air and water, the underground injection or other disposal of our wastes, the use of hydraulic fracturing fluids and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas producing properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, and many of our competitors have more established presences in the United States and in foreign locations than we have. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased in recent years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTechnology and Innovation\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nConsumer Confidence\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by the conditions of the global economies and the credit, commodities, and stock markets. Among other things, we may be adversely impacted if consumers of oil and gas are not able to access sufficient capital to continue to operate their businesses or to operate them at prior levels. A decline in consumer confidence or changing patterns in the availability and use of disposable income by consumers can negatively affect the demand for oil and gas and as a result our results of operations.\nAlternative Energy\nBecause our operations depend on the demand for oil, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil, gas and oil and gas related products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReserve Valuation\nThe process of estimating oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of our reserves. To prepare our year-end reserve estimates, our independent petroleum consultant projected our production rates and timing of development expenditures. Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be under our control. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month un-weighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nFuture Regulations\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas and operational safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEmployee Retention\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management. The loss of the services of any of our senior management, could have a negative impact on our operations. We do not maintain or plan to obtain for the benefit of the Company any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nEquity Dilution\nOur board of directors may attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing managements ability to maintain control, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nIlliquid and Volatile Equity Environment\nOur stock is currently not actively traded because of SEC Rule 15c2-11, and other factors. Variables that could affect our future stock price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf our actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserves estimates;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income, and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf public reaction to our press releases, announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or other shareholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf the limited amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;\n\u25cf general financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u25cf the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf the prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur future stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the future trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the historical limited volume of our shares which trade, we believe that our future stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect the actual value of our common stock. Shareholders and potential investors in our common stock should exercise extreme caution before making any future investment in us.\nAdditionally, as a result of the historical illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. We cannot assure you that a future trading market for our common stock will develop or, if one develops, be sustained. Extreme caution should be taken when considering the future purchase of Petrolias common stock.\nAdministrative Proceedings\nFile No. 3-20724 was filed by the SEC seeking to revoke the registration of each class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The Company has filed a response to the SECs motion, but there is no assurance that the Company will be successful, and that the registration of the Companys securities will not be revoked.\nOn September 27, 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) pulled the Companys stock symbol due to inactivity in the Companys security for a year. The Company is taking steps to become current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and upon becoming current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it plans to engage a market maker to file a Form 15c2-11 with FINRA and obtain a stock symbol.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nOn December 30, 2021, the Company reached a settlement with Argonaut Insurance Company (Argo), regarding a final judgement of $52,749 that had been issued on March 6, 2018. The company paid Argo a lump sum of $15,000 in full satisfaction of the original judgement.\nOn January 28, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings and Notice of Hearing Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months or revoke the registration of each class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Company. The Division of Enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Division) filed a Motion for Summary Disposition in this matter and the Company filed a Response to the Motion for Summary Disposition in April 2022. On May 5, 2022, the Division filed its Response in Support of its Motion for Summary Disposition.\nOn March 11, 2022, Petrolia Energy Corporation (Petrolia or the Company) and Petrolia Canada Corporation (Petrolia Canada), an affiliate of Petrolias, filed a lawsuit in District Court, Harris County Texas against Jovian Petroleum Corporation, Zel Khan and Quinten Beasley (herein collectively after referred to as the Defendants). The case is assigned to Judge Jaclanel McFarland, of the 133rd Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas under Cause No. 2022-15278.\nIn their filed petition against the Defendants, Petrolia and Petrolia Canada claim fraud and breach of contract against all the named Defendants and, in addition to those two (2) claims, they also assert breach of fiduciary duty claims against Defendants Zel Khan and Quinten Beasley. Defendant Zel Khan was a former CEO and Director of Petrolia, and Defendant Quinten Beasley was a former Senior Vice President and Director of Petrolia Canada.\nPetrolia and Petrolia Canada are demanding a jury trial and are seeking monetary relief of more than ONE MILLION US DOLLARS ($1,000,000.00) in their lawsuit filed against the Defendants. In the lawsuit filed by the two (2) companies against the Defendants, referenced above, they seek judgment against the Defendants for (i) actual damages in the amount of lost revenue and economic losses, (ii) punitive damages, (iii) pre-and post-judgment interest, (iv) court costs, (v) attorneys fees, and (vi) any other relief to which Petrolia and Petrolia Canada are entitled.\nIn September 2022, Defendants filed an amended answer and counterclaims. Defendants are seeking indemnification under the Companys governing documents and statutory provisions. Beasley is also seeking repayment of the outstanding balance of $5,000 plus accrued interest in connection with a promissory note entered into with the Company on July 14, 2016. On October 11, 2022, Petrolia and Petrolia Canada filed a general denial of all of the Defendants counterclaims. The outcome of the above litigation is currently unknown; however, the Company disputes the Defendants counterclaims and intends to defend the matter vigorously, while also continuing to seek all damages which it is due.\nOn March 16, 2022, Petrolia Canada Corporation received a Notice of Intention to Retain Collateral Pursuant to Section 62 of the Personal Property Security Act (Alberta) from the counsel of Blue Sky Resources Ltd. related to a Loan Agreement and General Security Agreement between Petrolia Canada Corporation and Emmett Lescroart. Petrolia Canada Corporation was notified that Blue Sky Resources Ltd., as assignee of the Emmet Lescroart loan, intends to retain the Utikuma loan collateral pursuant to the General Security Agreement with Petrolia Canada Corporation. On March 30, 2022, Petrolia Canada Corporations counsel responded to Blue Sky Resources, Ltd. with a Notice of Objection. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOn September 27, 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) pulled the Companys stock symbol due to inactivity in the Companys security for a year. The Company is taking steps to become current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and upon becoming current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it plans to engage a market maker to file a Form 15c2-11 with FINRA and obtain a stock symbol.\nWhen allowed to be traded, our common stock has historically been quoted under the symbol BBLS on the OTC Pink Sheet market operated by OTC Markets Group. Our common stock is currently not traded because of SEC Rule 15c2-11 and FINRA pulling the Conpanys stock symbol due to inactivity.\nHistorically, only a limited market exists for our securities. There is no assurance that a regular trading market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to resell his securities in our company. Extreme caution should be taken when evaluating the future purchase of Petrolia Energy common stock.\nThe following tables set forth the historical range of high and low sales prices for our common stock for the periods indicated as reported by the OTC Pink Sheet market operated by the OTC Markets Group. The market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commissions and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nQuarter Ended High Low\nMarch 31, 2021 $ 0.0475 $ 0.0200\nJune 30, 2021 $ 0.0570 $ 0.0212\nSeptember 30, 2021 $ 0.0397 $ 0.0003\nDecember 31, 2021 $ 0.0030 $ 0.0030\nQuarter Ended High Low\nMarch 31, 2020 $ 0.090 $ 0.031\nJune 30, 2020 $ 0.079 $ 0.023\nSeptember 30, 2020 $ 0.053 $ 0.011\nDecember 31, 2020 $ 0.040 $ 0.013\nPenny Stock\nOn September 27, 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) pulled the Companys stock symbol due to inactivity in the Companys security for a year. The Company is taking steps to become current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and upon becoming current in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it plans to engage a market maker to file a Form 15c2-11 with FINRA and obtain a stock symbol.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.\nThe broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities.\nPetrolia Energy Corporation is currently not being actively traded because of SEC Rule 15c2-11 and because (FINRA) pulled the Companys stock symbol due to inactivity in the Companys security for a year.\nHolders of Our Common Stock\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 176,988,322 outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 279 shareholders of record. As of December 9, 2022, we had 176,988,322 outstanding shares of common stock and approximately 279 shareholders of record.\nPreferred Stock\nOur Certificate of Formation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The provisions in the Certificate of Formation, relating to the preferred stock, allow our directors to issue preferred stock with multiple votes per share and dividend rights which would have priority over any dividends paid with respect to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock with these rights may make the removal of management difficult even if the removal would be considered beneficial to shareholders generally and will have the effect of limiting shareholder participation in certain transactions such as mergers or tender offers if these transactions are not favored by our management.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there are 199,100 shares of Series A Preferred outstanding with 21 preferred shareholders of record.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Company issued one share each of its newly designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Board of Directors members James Burns, Leo Womack, and Ivar Siem , in consideration for services rendered to the Company as members of the Board of Directors. These shares vote in aggregate sixty percent of the total vote on all shareholder matters. These shares were valued at $50,799 per share by an independent specialist. The purpose of issuing the three Series B Preferred shares is to protect the company while the disputes described in the Form 8-K Current Report, filed on March 18, 2022, are heard and resolved through the U.S. court system. The Series B Preferred shares will be retired once the litigation is resolved. As of December 31, 2021, there are 3 Series B preferred shares outstanding with 3 preferred shareholders of record.\nIn October and November of 2021 and January of 2022, the Company entered into various subscription agreements to sell an aggregate amount of 11,000 shares of its newly designated Series C Convertible Preferred Stock at $10 per share. As of December 31, 2021, there are 8,500 Series C preferred shares outstanding with 3 preferred shareholders of record.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth information, as of December 31, 2021, with respect to our compensation plans under which common stock is authorized for issuance.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\n(A) (B) (C)\nPlan Category Number of securities to issue upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options and warrants Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in Column A)\nEquity compensation plans approved by shareholders (1) - N/A 40,000,000\nEquity compensation plans not approved by shareholders 29,700,000 $0.13 per share -\nTotal 29,700,000 $0.13 per share 40,000,000\n(1) The Companys 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the Plan) provides for up to 40,000,000 shares of awards. At present, no shares have been issued from the Plan.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nIn October and November of 2021, and January 2022, the Company entered into various subscription agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed, subject to certain conditions in the Subscription Agreements, to purchase an aggregate amount of 11,000 shares of the Companys newly designated shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share at $10.00 per share. 8,500 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock were sold in 2021.\nAll shares granted for goods or services and settlement of liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021, and through the date of the filing of this Report were valued based on the fair value of the shares issued.\nWe claim an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in connection with the sales, grants and issuances described above since the foregoing issuances and grants did not involve a public offering, the recipients were (a) accredited investors, and/or (b) had access to similar documentation and information as would be required in a Registration Statement under the Securities Act. With respect to the transactions described above, no general solicitation was made either by us or by any person acting on our behalf. The transactions were privately negotiated and did not involve any kind of public solicitation. No underwriters or agents were involved in the foregoing issuances, and we paid no underwriting discounts or commissions. The securities sold are subject to transfer restrictions, and the certificates evidencing the securities contain an appropriate legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. ITEM 6. (RESERVED) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution you that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. See Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $5,895,228, an increase of $3,002,987 from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to greater production at our Utikuma field.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $7,307,025, a decrease of $5,275,229 from the prior year. This was primarily due to the forfeiture of TLSAU leases in 2020, which resulted in a $6,225,103 loss and impairments of $396,922 in our U.S. properties. There was an increase of $1,718,746 in lease operating expense, due to the increased production in our Canadian assets, and a $744,136 decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization due to a smaller depletion base.\nOther Income/Expenses\nOther income/expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was other net income of $3,340,701, a change of $3,959,707 from the prior year net expense. The primary cause for the change was the gain on the disposition of the Cona asset, in the amount of $3,919,323. There was also other net expense of $101,297, the major components of this were other income from the forgiveness of the PPP loan and other expense due to adjustments made to our Canadian receivables.\nNet Income\nThe net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,928,904, compared to net loss of $10,309,019 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a change of $12,237,923 from the prior year for the reasons described above, primarily the disposition of the Cona asset.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total current assets of $25,641 and total assets of $7,838,486. Our total current liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were $6,620,065 and our total liabilities were $8,899,646. We had negative working capital of $6,594,424 as of December 31, 2021.\nOur material asset balances are made up of oil and gas properties and related equipment. Our most significant liabilities include asset retirement obligations of $2,257,027, accrued liabilities and related party accrued liabilities of $2,011,170, notes payable of $3,438,162 and related party notes payable of $779,373.\nOperating activities used $105,578 in cash for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $0.\nCash used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $35,890 and consisted of $85,000 of proceeds from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock, which was offset by $120,890 of repayments of notes payable.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company operated at a negative cash flow from operations of approximately $9,000 per month and our auditors have raised a going concern in their audit report as contained herein. Management also plans to minimize general and administrative expenses and optimize cashflow from the Utikuma asset.\nThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations. These conditions raise doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to generate profits by reducing general and administrative expenses and optimizing Utikuma cashflow. However, we may need to raise additional funds to workover wells through the sale of our securities, through loans from third parties or from third parties willing to pay our share of drilling and completing the wells. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital.\nIf additional financing is not available when needed, we may need to cease operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the capital needed to recomplete oil or gas wells nor that any such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nManagement believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern; no adjustments to the financial statements have been made to account for this uncertainty.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nTrends Affecting Future Operations\nThe factors that will most significantly affect our results of operations will be (i) the sale prices of crude oil and natural gas, (ii) the amount of production sold from oil or gas wells in which we have an interest, and (iii) lease operating expenses. Our revenues will also be significantly impacted by our ability to maintain or increase oil or gas production through exploration and development activities, and the availability of funding to complete such activities.\nIt is expected that our principal source of cash flow will be from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas reserves which are depleting assets. Cash flow from the sale of oil and gas production depends upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for the production. An increase in prices will permit us to finance our operations to a greater extent with internally generated funds, may allow us to obtain equity financing more easily or on better terms, and lessens the difficulty of obtaining financing. However, price increases may heighten the competition for oil and gas prospects, and may increase the costs of exploration and development.\nA decline in oil and gas prices (i) will reduce the cash flow internally generated by the Company which in turn will reduce the funds available for exploring for and replacing oil and gas reserves, (ii) will increase the difficulty of obtaining equity and debt financing and worsen the terms on which such financing may be obtained, (iii) will reduce the number of oil and gas prospects which have reasonable economic terms, (iv) may cause us to permit leases to expire based upon the value of potential oil and gas reserves in relation to the costs of exploration, (v) may result in marginally productive oil and gas wells being abandoned as non-commercial, and (vi) may increase the difficulty of obtaining financing. However, price declines reduce the competition for oil and gas properties and correspondingly reduce the prices paid for leases and prospects.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nGoing concern - The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of $61,339,161 since its inception and may require capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities to take place. The Companys ability to raise additional capital through the future sales of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Companys contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flow. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nPursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (\u00a7 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nThe consolidated audited financial statements and supplementary data required by this Item are presented beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which follows Signatures below. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAn evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer and implemented by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework of 2013. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2021.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to an insufficient degree of segregation of duties amongst our accounting and financial reporting personnel, the lack of a formalized and complete set of policy and procedure documentation evidencing our system of internal controls over financial reporting, and the possibility that company employees were also contracted to perform the accounting of affiliated parties. These factors led to certain adjustments which have been reflected in our audited financial statements. These weaknesses may not be uncommon in a company of our size due to personnel and financial limitations.\nManagement is committed to remediating the identified material weakness in a timely manner, with appropriate oversight from our Audit Committee. We intend to work to remediate the material weaknesses identified above, which is expected to include (i) the addition of accounting and financial personnel with experience in the implementation of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and SEC reporting requirements, (ii) the engagement of accounting consultants on a limited-time basis to provide expertise on specific areas of the accounting literature, (iii) the modification to our accounting processes and enhancement to our financial controls, (iv) the elimination of employees or contractors also being employed by affiliated parties and/or (v) the hiring of an independent consulting or accounting firm to review and document our internal control system to ensure compliance with COSO. However, our current financial position will make it difficult for us to undertake the planned remediation steps outlined above.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept as noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company are currently held separately. Mr. Burns serves as Chairman and Mr. Allen serves as Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors does not have a policy as to whether the Chairman should be an independent director, an affiliated director, or a member of management. Our Board believes that the Companys current leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and the members of our Board. It does this by giving primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to its Chief Executive Officer, while enabling our Chairman to facilitate our Boards oversight of management, promote communication between management and our Board, and support our Boards consideration of key governance matters. The Board believes that its programs for overseeing risk, as described below, would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and therefore do not materially affect its choice of structure.\nRisk Oversight\nEffective risk oversight is an important priority of the Board of Directors. Because risks are considered in virtually every business decision, the Board of Directors discusses risk throughout the year generally or in connection with specific proposed actions. The Board of Directors approach to risk oversight includes understanding the critical risks in the Companys business and strategy, evaluating the Companys risk management processes, allocating responsibilities for risk oversight, and fostering an appropriate culture of integrity and compliance with legal responsibilities. The directors exercise direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company.\nFamily Relationships\nNone of our directors are related by blood, marriage, or adoption to any other director, executive officer, or other key employees.\nArrangements Between Officers and Directors\nTo our knowledge, there is no arrangement or understanding between any of our officers and any other person, including directors, pursuant to which the officer was selected to serve as an officer.\nOther Directorships\nNo directors of the Company are also directors of issuers with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act (or which otherwise are required to file periodic reports under the Exchange Act), except as discussed in their bios above.\nDirector Qualifications\nThe Board believes that each of our directors is highly qualified to serve as a member of the Board. Each of the directors has contributed to the mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications of the Board. When evaluating candidates for election to the Board, the Board seeks candidates with certain qualities that it believes are important, including integrity, an objective perspective, good judgment, and leadership skills. Our directors are highly educated and have diverse backgrounds and talents and extensive track records of success in what we believe are highly relevant positions.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, none of our executive officers or directors has been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years:\n(1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;\n(2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being a named subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and minor offenses);\n(3) being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities;\n(4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law;\n(5) being the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of (i) any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; (ii) any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies, including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or (iii) any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n(6) being the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act), any registered entity (as defined in Section (1a)(40) of the Commodity Exchange Act), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity, or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nBoard of Directors Meetings\nThe Company had four (4) official meetings of the Board of Directors during the fiscal year 2021 and four (4) during the previous fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. All directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and meetings of Committees of the Board of Directors, for committees on which they served. The Company has not adopted a policy requiring its directors to attend its annual meeting.\nHedging, Clawbacks and Insider Trading Policies\nThe Company does not currently hedge any oil and gas products.\nInsider trading includes the trading of our stock and options (put and call), based on material, non-public information about the Company. The Company prohibits any insider trading shares based on insider information and could be exposed to potential civil and/or criminal penalties. It also prohibits the sharing of that information with other non-insider individuals. This policy applies to the purchase/sale of common stock and preferred stock. The Company prohibits the trading of options at any time, irrespective of stock trading restrictions. This policy applies to all directors, officers, employees, and consultants of the Company, as well as their family members. This policy imposes special additional temporary trading restrictions applicable to directors and officers of the Company.\nCOMMITTEES OF THE BOARD\nBoard Committee Membership\nIndependent Audit\nCommittee Compensation\nCommittee\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nJames E.

Copies of the committee charters are also available for free upon written request to our Corporate Secretary. Additionally, the committee charters are filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 24, 2018 (the Form 8-K).\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee, which is comprised exclusively of independent directors, has been established by the Board to oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our financial statements.\nThe Board has selected the members of the Audit Committee based on the Boards determination that the members are financially literate (as required by NASDAQ rules) and qualified to monitor the performance of management and the independent auditors and to monitor our disclosures so that our disclosures fairly present our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Board has also determined that Mr. Womack, is an audit committee financial expert (as defined in the SEC rules) because he has the following attributes: (i) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) and financial statements; (ii) the ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves; (iii) experience analyzing and evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by our financial statements; (iv) an understanding of internal control over financial reporting; and (v) an understanding of audit committee functions. Mr. Womack has acquired these attributes by means of having held various positions that provided relevant experience, as described in his biographical above.\nThe Audit Committee has the sole authority, at its discretion and at our expense, to retain, compensate, evaluate and terminate our independent auditors and to review, as it deems appropriate, the scope of our annual audits, our accounting policies and reporting practices, our system of internal controls, our compliance with policies regarding business conduct and other matters. In addition, the Audit Committee has the authority, at its discretion and at our expense, to retain special legal, accounting, or other advisors to advise the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee was formed on May 21, 2018.\nThe Audit Committee Charter is filed as Exhibit 99.3 to the Form 8-K filed on May 24, 2018.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for the administration of our stock compensation plans, approval, review and evaluation of the compensation arrangements for our executive officers and directors and oversees and advises the Board on the adoption of policies that govern the Companys compensation and benefit programs. In addition, the Compensation Committee has the authority, at its discretion and at our expense, to retain special legal, accounting or other advisors to advise the Compensation Committee.\nThe Compensation Committee was formed on May 21, 2018.\nThe Compensation Committee Charter is filed as Exhibit 99.4 to the Form 8-K filed on May 24, 2018.\nOn July 13, 2020, when Joel Oppenheim resigned as Chairman of the Compensation Committee, James Burns replaced him as Chairman of the Compensation Committee.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which is comprised exclusively of independent directors, is responsible for identifying prospective qualified candidates to fill vacancies on the Board, recommending director nominees (including chairpersons) for each of our committees, developing and recommending appropriate corporate governance guidelines and overseeing the self-evaluation of the Board.\nIn considering individual director nominees and Board committee appointments, our Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and Board committees and to identify individuals who can effectively assist the Company in achieving our short-term and long-term goals, protecting our stockholders interests and creating and enhancing value for our stockholders. In so doing, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers a persons diversity attributes (e.g., professional experiences, skills, background, race and gender) as a whole and does not necessarily attribute any greater weight to one attribute. Moreover, diversity in professional experience, skills and background, and diversity in race and gender, are just a few of the attributes that the Nominating and Governance Committee takes into account. In evaluating prospective candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee also considers whether the individual has personal and professional integrity, good business judgment and relevant experience and skills, and whether such individual is willing and able to commit the time necessary for Board and Board committee service.\nWhile there are no specific minimum requirements that the Nominating and Governance Committee believes must be met by a prospective director nominee, the Nominating and Governance Committee does believe that director nominees should possess personal and professional integrity, have good business judgment, have relevant experience and skills, and be willing and able to commit the necessary time for Board and Board committee service. Furthermore, the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending individuals that can best perpetuate the success of our business and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound business judgment using their diversity of experience in various areas. We believe our current directors possess diverse professional experiences, skills and backgrounds, in addition to (among other characteristics) high standards of personal and professional ethics, proven records of success in their respective fields and valuable knowledge of our business and our industry.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee also regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or other circumstances. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, from time to time, various potential candidates for directorships. Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating and Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. These candidates may be evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Nominating and Governance Committee and may be considered at any point during the year.\nThe Committee evaluates director nominees at regular or special Committee meetings pursuant to the criteria described above and reviews qualified director nominees with the Board. The Committee selects nominees that best suit the Boards current needs and recommends one or more of such individuals for election to the Board.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee was formed on May 21, 2018.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee Charter is filed as Exhibit 99.5 to the Form 8-K filed on May 24, 2018.\nStockholder Communications with the Board\nOur Company has defined policy and procedural requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors as set forth in the Companys Bylaws and described below. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders, provided the names of such persons, accompanied by relevant biographical information, are properly submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Company in accordance with the manner described below. The Secretary will send properly submitted stockholder recommendations to the Nominating and Governance Committee. Individuals recommended by stockholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration received by individuals identified to the Nominating and Governance Committee through other means. The Nominating and Governance Committee also may, in its discretion, consider candidates otherwise recommended by stockholders without accompanying biographical information, if submitted in writing to the Secretary.\nOur stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with members of the Board of Directors by submitting such communications in writing to our Corporate Secretary, 710 N. Post Oak Rd., Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77024, who, upon receipt of any communication other than one that is clearly marked Confidential, will note the date the communication was received, open the communication, make a copy of it for our files and promptly forward the communication to the director(s) to whom it is addressed. Upon receipt of any communication that is clearly marked Confidential, our Corporate Secretary will not open the communication, but will note the date the communication was received and promptly forward the communication to the director(s) to whom it is addressed. If the correspondence is not addressed to any particular Board member or members, the communication will be forwarded to a Board member to bring to the attention of the Board.\nCode of Conduct\nWe have adopted a Code of Ethical Business Conduct (Code of Conduct ) that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees.\nAny stockholder who so requests may obtain a free copy of our Code of Conduct by submitting a written request to our Corporate Secretary. Additionally, the Code of Conduct was filed as an exhibit to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, filed with the SEC on November 23, 2015, as Exhibit 14.1.\nWe intend to disclose any amendments to our Code of Conduct and any waivers with respect to our Code of Conduct granted to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, or any of our other employees performing similar functions on our website at www.petroliaenergy.com within four business days after the amendment or waiver. In such case, the disclosure regarding the amendment or waiver will remain available on our website for at least 12 months after the initial disclosure. There have been no waivers granted with respect to our Code of Conduct to any such officers or employees.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Companys equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.\nPursuant to SEC rules, we are not required to disclose in this filing any failure to timely file a Section 16(a) report that has been disclosed by us in a prior annual report or proxy statement.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock and preferred stock by (i) each person who is known by the Company to own beneficially more than five percent (5%) of our outstanding voting stock; (ii) each of our directors and director nominees; (iii) each of our executive officers and significant employees; and (iv) all of our current executive officers, significant employees and directors as a group, as of December 9, 2022 (the Date of Determination).\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting and/or investing power with respect to securities. These rules generally provide that shares of common stock subject to options, warrants or other convertible securities that are currently exercisable or convertible, or exercisable or convertible within 60 days of the Date of Determination, are deemed to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person or group holding such options, warrants or other convertible securities for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such person or group, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person or group.\nWe believe that, except as otherwise noted and subject to applicable community property laws, each person named in the following table has sole investment and voting power with respect to the shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by such person. Unless otherwise indicated, the address for each of the officers or directors listed in the table below is 710 N.

Also under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the number of shares is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the above table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual voting power at any particular date.\n(1) Not including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock held by each holder.\n(2) Except as otherwise indicated, all shares are owned directly, and the percentage shown is based on 176,988,322 shares of common stock and 199,100 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and 8,500 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the Date of Determination. The Series A Preferred Stock (and accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) are convertible into shares of common stock of the Company on a 71.429-for-one basis. The Series A and C Preferred Stock includes a blocker prohibiting the conversion of the Series A or C Preferred Stock into common stock of the Company, if upon such conversion/exercise the holder thereof would beneficially own more than 4.999% of the Companys then outstanding common stock, provided such limitation shall not apply in the event of an automatic conversion of the Series A or C Preferred Stock (the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). The Beneficial Ownership Limitation also limits the voting rights of any holders of the Series A or C Preferred Stock, the effects of which have been reflected in the table above. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation may be waived by any holder with 61 days prior written notice to the Company.\n(3) Includes all shares of common stock beneficially owned by each named person, all shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants which have vested, or which will vest within 60 days of the Date of Determination to the named person, and all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series A and C Preferred Stock held by the named person, subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.\n(4) Includes all shares of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Womack and the Leo B.

(American Resources) and all shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants which have vested, or which will vest within 60 days of the Date of Determination to Mr. Siem and American Resources. Mr. Siem is deemed to beneficially own the securities held by American Resources due to his position as Director and CEO of American Resources.\n(7) Includes all shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock held by Mr. Allen, which have vested, or which will vest within 60 days of the Date of Determination.\n(8) Address: 7941 Katy Fwy, Suite 522, Houston, Texas 77024. Includes all shares of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Beasley, Critical Communication LLC (Critical), all shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants which have vested, or which will vest within 60 days of the Date of Determination to Mr. Beasley, Critical.

Mr. Khan is deemed to beneficially own the securities held by Jovian due to his position as President of Jovian.\n(10) Includes all shares of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Oppenheim, all shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants which have vested, or which will vest within 60 days of the Date of Determination to Mr. Oppenheim, and for the Total Beneficial Ownership column, shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by Mr. Oppenheim, subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.\n(11) Address: 10360 Kestrel Street, Plantation, Florida, 33324.\n(12) On October 25, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the filing of a Certificate of Designations of Petrolia Energy Corporation Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations, and Relative Rights of its Series B Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Texas, which designation was filed with, and became effective with, the Secretary of State of Texas on October 25, 2021. The Series B Designation designated three shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Company issued one share of its newly designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock to each of the three members of its then Board of Directors, (1) James E. Burns, (2) Leo Womack and (3) Ivar Siem, in consideration for services rendered to the Company as members of the Board of Directors. Such shares of Series B Preferred Stock vote in aggregate sixty percent (60%) of the total vote on all shareholder matters, voting separately as a class.\nChanges in Control\nThe Company is not aware of any arrangements, which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of the Company. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.\nExcept as discussed below or otherwise disclosed above under Item 11. Executive Compensation,, Note 7 - Related Party Notes Payable, Note 10 - Equity and Note 11 - Related Party Transactions, of the consolidated audited financial statements included herein, all of which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 13, there have been no transactions since the beginning of the Companys last fiscal year, and there is not currently any proposed transaction, in which the Company was or is to be a participant, where the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of the Companys total assets at year end, for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any officer, director, or any stockholder owning greater than five percent (5%) of our outstanding voting shares, nor any member of the above referenced individuals immediate family, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nOn August 1, 2017, Mr. Joel Oppenheim provided a Letter of Credit (LOC), which was posted as collateral in order for the Company to issue operating bonds with the State of New Mexico for the operation of Twin Lakes San Andres Unit wells. In exchange for the LOC, the Company issued Mr. Oppenheim 2,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $246,000 and warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.14 per share.\nOn August 21, 2019, the Company closed private placements with related parties for gross proceeds of $150,000, consisting of 1,875,000 shares of common stock and 3,750,000 warrants to purchase shares of common stock, exercisable at a price of $0.10 per share at any time prior to November 1, 2020. American Resources Offshore Inc. (of which Ivar Siem, our director) subscribed for 312,500 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 625,000 shares of common stock. Leo Womack, our director, subscribed for 312,500 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 625,000 shares of common stock.

Joel Martin Oppenheim subscribed for 625,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the filing of a Certificate of Designations of Petrolia Energy Corporation Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations, and Relative Rights of its Series B Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Texas, which designation was filed with, and became effective with, the Secretary of State of Texas on October 25, 2021. The Series B Designation designated three shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Company issued one share of its newly designated shares of Series B Preferred Stock to each of the three members of its then Board of Directors, (1) James E. Burns, (2) Leo Womack and (3) Ivar Siem, in consideration for services rendered to the Company as members of the Board of Directors. Such shares of Series B Preferred Stock vote in aggregate sixty percent (60%) of the total vote on all shareholder matters, voting separately as a class. The purpose of issuing the three Series B Preferred shares is to protect the company while the disputes described in the Form 8-K Current Report, filed on March 18, 2022, are heard and resolved through the U.S. court system. The Series B Preferred shares will be retired once the litigation is resolved.\nIn October and November of 2021, and January 2022, the Company entered into various subscription agreements with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed, subject to certain conditions in the Subscription Agreements, to purchase an aggregate amount of 11,000 shares of the Companys newly designated shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share at $10.00 per share. Investors in the offering include the Companys director, Leo Womack, who purchased $50,000 in shares of Series C Preferred Stock (5,000 shares).\nReview, Approval and Ratification of Related Party Transactions\nOn August 22, 2018, the Company adopted a formal related party transaction policy (the Policy) for the review, approval, or ratification of transactions, such as those described above, with our directors, nominees for director, executive officers and significant shareholders or certain entities or persons related to them.\nUnder the terms of the Policy, the Audit Committee shall review the material facts of all related party transactions and may approve or disapprove of the entry into the related party transaction. Where advance Audit Committee review of a related party transaction is not feasible or has otherwise not been obtained, then the related party transaction shall be reviewed subsequently by the Audit Committee (and such transaction may be ratified subsequently by the Audit Committee). The Audit Committee may also disapprove of a previously entered into related party transaction and may require that management of the Company take all reasonable efforts to terminate, unwind, cancel or annul the related party transaction. The Audit Committee shall be authorized to review in advance and provide standing pre-approval in advance of certain related party transactions or categories of related party transactions which include employment of executive officers, director compensation and others. The Audit Committee or the Board of Directors may recommend the creation of a special Audit Committee to review any related party transaction.\nEach officer and/or director who is a related party with respect to a particular related party transaction shall disclose all material information to the Audit Committee concerning such related party transaction and his or her interest in such transaction. Any member of the Audit Committee who has a potential interest in any related party transaction shall recuse himself or herself and abstain from voting on the approval or ratification of the related party transaction but may participate in all or a portion of the Audit Committees discussions of the related party transaction, if requested by the Audit Committee.\nIn connection with its review of a related party transaction, the Audit Committee shall take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, including the following factors, among others, to the extent relevant to the related party transaction:\n\u25cf Whether the terms of the related party transaction are fair to the Company and would apply on the same basis if the transaction did not involve a related party, i.e., whether the terms of the transaction would be the same if the transaction was undertaken on an arms-length basis;\n\u25cf Whether there are any compelling business reasons for the Company to enter into the related party transaction and the nature of alternative transactions, if any;\n\u25cf Whether the related party transaction would impair the independence of an otherwise independent director or nominee for director;\n\u25cf Whether the Company was notified about the related party transaction before its commencement and if not, why pre-approval was not sought and whether subsequent ratification would be detrimental to the Company; and\n\u25cf Whether the related party transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any related party, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the related party, the direct or indirect nature of the related partys interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship and any other factors the Audit Committee deems relevant.\nIf a related party transaction will be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for the Companys management to follow in its ongoing dealings with the related party. Thereafter, the Audit Committee shall periodically review and assess ongoing relationships with the related party. Any material amendment, renewal or extension of a transaction, arrangement or relationship previously reviewed under the Policy shall also be subject to subsequent review under the Policy.\nIn addition to guidelines for ongoing related party transactions, the Audit Committee may, as it deems appropriate and reasonable, establish from time-to-time guidelines regarding the review of other related party transactions including those that (i) involve de minimus amounts, (ii) do not require public disclosure, or (iii) involve transactions that have primarily a charitable purpose.\nDirector Independence\nOur common stock was quoted for trading on the OTC Pink Sheet market operated by OTC Markets Group and we are not required to have independent members of our Board of Directors pursuant to OTC Pink Sheet market rules.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and has a working capital deficit at December 31, 2021, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB .\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nCapital Stock and Other Equity Accounts\nAs discussed in Note 10, the Company issues preferred stock, stock options, and warrants as stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees.\nAuditing managements or the specialists calculation of the fair value of the preferred stock, options, and warrants issued can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management or specialists estimates on various inputs to the calculations.\nTo test the valuation of the preferred stock, options, and warrants, we evaluated managements and the specialists significant judgments and estimates. Significant judgements and estimates related to the valuation of the preferred stock, options, and warrants include fair valuing of warrants and options which involve significant estimates of volatility, grant terms, risk-free rates and the use of historical trading data. We evaluated managements conclusions regarding their fair values and reviewed support for the significant inputs used in the valuation models, as well as assessing the models for reasonableness. In addition, we evaluated the Companys disclosure in relation to this matter included in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements\ns/ M&K CPAS, PLLC\nM&K CPAS, PLLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since\nHouston, TX\nDecember 9, 2022\nPETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 14,058 $ 155,045\nAccounts receivable 5,942 5,000\nOther current assets 5,641 39,443\nTotal current assets 25,641 199,488\nProperty & equipment\nOil and gas, on the basis of full cost accounting:\nEvaluated Properties 6,797,025 8,619,427\nFurniture, equipment & software 155,293 201,110\nLess accumulated depreciation & depletion (603,135 ) (2,868,453 )\nNet property and equipment 6,349,183 5,952,084\nOther assets\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Asset 12,821 23,145\nOther assets 1,450,841 985,187\nTotal Assets $ 7,838,486 $ 7,159,904\nLIABILITIES & STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 320,088 $ 1,067,841\nAccounts payable -

The Companys proportionate share of earnings is included in earnings and added to or deducted from the cost of the investment.\nForeign currency translation\nThe functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, Askarii Resources and Petrolia Canada Corporation are the United States dollar and the Canadian dollar, respectively. Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted into the Companys functional currency using the exchange rates in effect at the time of the transactions. At the balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currency are translated using exchange rates at that date. Exchange gains and losses are included in net earnings. On consolidation, Petrolia Canada Corporations income statement amounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year, while the assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income.\nManagement estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made in preparing these financial statements include depreciation of furniture, equipment and software, asset retirement obligations (AROs) (Note 9), income taxes (Note 13) and the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (Note 15).\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not hold any cash equivalents.\nReceivables and allowance for doubtful accounts\nOil revenues receivable do not bear any interest. These receivables are primarily comprised of joint interest billings. Management regularly reviews collectability and establishes or adjusts an allowance for uncollectible amounts as necessary using the specific identification method. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Management has determined that a reserve for uncollectible amounts was not required in the periods presented.\nOil and gas properties\nThe Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on nonproducing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of oil and gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to operations.\nThe capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense using the units-of-production method based on estimated proved recoverable oil and gas reserves.\nThe costs associated with unevaluated and unproved properties, initially excluded from the amortization base, relate to unproved leasehold acreage, wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of the existence of proved reserves, together with capitalized interest costs for these projects. Unproved leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well once a determination of the existence of proved reserves has been made or upon impairment of a lease. Costs associated with wells in progress and completed wells that have yet to be evaluated are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry wells are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful.\nAll items classified as unproved property are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value. Properties are assessed on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; assignment of proved reserves; and economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and become subject to amortization.\nUnder full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties, including asset retirement costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the cost ceiling) equal to the sum of (a) the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves, based on current prices and operating conditions, discounted at ten percent (10%), plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to operations. For purposes of the ceiling test calculation, current prices are defined as the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices are adjusted for basis or location differentials. Unless sales contracts specify otherwise, prices are held constant for the productive life of each well. Similarly, current costs are assumed to remain constant over the entire calculation period.\nGiven the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term. If oil and gas prices decline in the future, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that impairments of oil and gas properties could occur. In addition, it is reasonably possible that impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present value of future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted present value of the related proved oil and gas reserves.\nFurniture, equipment and software\nFurniture, equipment, and software are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related asset, generally three to five years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. Management performs ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment for depreciation purposes. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Management periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than oil and gas property, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value.\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Companys derivative financial instruments consist of warrants with an exercise price denominated in the Companys functional currency. These derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in fair value are recorded in net income.\nAsset retirement obligations\nThe Company records a liability for Asset Retirement Obligations (AROs) associated with its oil and gas wells when those assets are placed in service. The corresponding cost is capitalized as an asset and included in the carrying amount of oil and gas properties and is depleted over the useful life of the properties. Subsequently, the ARO liability is accreted to its then-present value.\nInherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.\nDebt issuance costs\nCosts incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt and amortized over the term of the related debt.\nRevenue recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of the contract(s) which includes (i) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company adopted this standard on a modified retroactive basis on January 1, 2018. No financial statement impact occurred upon adoption.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product to a customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products.\nPerformance obligations and significant judgments\nThe Company sells oil and natural gas products in the United States through a single reportable segment. The Company enters into contracts that generally include one type of distinct product in variable quantities and priced based on a specific index related to the type of product.\nThe oil and natural gas is typically sold in an unprocessed state to processors and other third parties for processing and sale to customers. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of the oil or natural gas passes to the customer or processor, as applicable, discussed below. For oil sales, control is typically transferred to the customer upon receipt at the wellhead or a contractually agreed upon delivery point. Under our natural gas contracts with processors, control transfers upon delivery at the wellhead or the inlet of the processing entitys system. For our other natural gas contracts, control transfers upon delivery to the inlet or to a contractually agreed upon delivery point. In the cases where the Company sells to a processor, management has determined that the Company is the principal in the arrangement and the processors are customers. The Company recognizes the revenue in these contracts based on the net proceeds received from the processor.\nTransfer of control drives the presentation of transportation and gathering costs within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Transportation and gathering costs incurred prior to control transfer are recorded within the transportation and gathering expense line item on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, while transportation and gathering costs incurred subsequent to control transfer are recorded as a reduction to the related revenue.\nA portion of our product sales are short-term in nature. For those contracts, the Company uses the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 exempting us from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nFor our product sales that have a contract term greater than one year, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) which states the Company is not required to disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the variable consideration is allocated entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation. Under these sales contracts, each unit of product represents a separate performance obligation; therefore, future volumes are unsatisfied, and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required. The Company has no unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of each reporting period.\nManagement does not believe that significant judgments are required with respect to the determination of the transaction price, including any variable consideration identified. There is a low level of uncertainty due to the precision of measurement and use of index-based pricing with predictable differentials. Additionally, any variable consideration identified is not constrained.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718. Stock-based compensation to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50. Equity instruments issued to other than employees are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments, and is recognized as expense over the service period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using the Black-Sholes Option Pricing Model for common stock options and warrants and the closing price of the Companys common stock for common share issuances. The Company may grant stock to employees and non-employees in exchange for goods, services or for settlement of liabilities. Shares granted to employees in exchange for goods, services or settlement of liabilities are measured based on the fair value of the shares issued. Shares granted to non-employees in exchange for goods or services are measured based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the shares issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. The Company provides for deferred taxes on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nUncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision. There are currently no unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the tax rate. There was no interest or penalties recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company is required to file federal income tax returns in the United States and Canada, and in various state and local jurisdictions. The Companys tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with the normal statutes of limitations in the applicable jurisdiction.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share has been calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The treasury stock method is used to compute the dilutive effect of the Companys share-based compensation awards. Under this method, the incremental number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share (EPS) is the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and purchased using assumed proceeds. Diluted EPS amounts would include the effect of outstanding stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities if including such potential shares of common stock is dilutive. Basic and diluted earnings per share are the same in all periods presented as all outstanding instruments are anti-dilutive.\nConcentration of credit risk\nThe Company is subject to credit risk resulting from the concentration of its oil receivables with significant purchasers. Three purchasers accounted for all of the Companys oil sales revenues for 2021 and 2020. The Company does not require collateral. While the Company believes its recorded receivables will be collected, in the event of default the Company would follow normal collection procedures. The Company does not believe the loss of a purchaser would materially impact its operating results as oil is a fungible product with a well-established market and numerous purchasers.\nAt times, the Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Management monitors the credit ratings and concentration of risk with these financial institutions on a continuing basis to safeguard cash deposits.\nFair value measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment;\n\u25cf Level 2 - Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and\n\u25cf Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nOur derivative liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and estimated as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON RECURRING BASIS\nDecember 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nDerivative liabilities - - 22,554 22,554\nARO liabilities - - 2,257,027 2,257,027\nDecember 31, 2020\nDerivative liabilities - - 183,798 183,798\nARO liabilities - - 3,624,133 3,624,133\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accounts payable - related parties, accrued liabilities and accrued liabilities - related parties, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximate fair value, due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of notes payable approximates their fair value due to immaterial changes in market interest rates and the Companys credit risk since issuance of the instruments or due to their short-term nature. Derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value every reporting period. Our derivative liabilities are considered level 3 financial instruments.\nRelated parties\nThe Audit Committee approves all material related party transactions. The Audit Committee is provided with the details of each new, existing or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits to the Company and the relevant related party. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the following factors are considered: (1) if the terms are fair to the Company, (2) if there are business reasons to enter into the transaction, (3) if the transaction would impair independence of an outside Director, or (4) if the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any Director or executive officer. Any member of the Audit Committee who has an interest in the transaction will abstain from voting on the approval of the related party transaction.\nBusiness combinations\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The ASU provides an updated model for determining if acquired assets and liabilities constitute a business. In a business combination, the acquired assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value and goodwill could be recognized. In an asset acquisition, the assets are allocated value based on relative fair value and no goodwill is recognized. The ASU narrows the definition of a business. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-01 did not have a material impact on our financial statements on adoption.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts previously presented for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on net loss, working capital or equity previously reported.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThe Company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements through the filing date and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company other than those discussed below.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize all rights and obligations created by those leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet. The accounting for lessors will remain largely unchanged from the existing accounting standards. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nUnder ASU 2016-02, each lease agreement will be evaluated to identify the lease components and non-lease components at lease inception. The total consideration in the lease agreement will be allocated to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases - Targeted Improvements that allows lessors to elect, as a practical expedient, to not separate lease and non-lease components and allows these components to be accounted for as a single lease component if both (1) the timing and pattern of transfer to the lessee of the lease component and the related non-lease component are the same and (2) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. In addition, a company is permitted to use its effective date as the date of initial application. Therefore, a company electing this option will not restate comparative period financial information, will not make the new required lease disclosures in comparative periods beginning before the effective date and will recognize its cumulative effect transition adjustment as of the effective date. Under the practical expedient mentioned above, it is expected that revenue will be presented under a single lease component presentation. The Company will elect this expedient upon adoption.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method, whereby a cumulative effect adjustment will be made as of that day with no retrospective effect. The Company applied the package of practical expedients such that for any expired or existing leases it will not reassess lease classification, initial direct costs or whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. Note that the Company had no outstanding leases as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, we entered a lease with a related party, that is accounted for and disclosed using the framework of ASC 842. See Note 6 for more details.\nNOTE 3. GOING CONCERN\nThe Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and currently has a working capital deficit. These conditions raise doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to generate profits by reducing overhead costs and reworking its existing oil or gas wells, as needed, funding permitting. The Company may need to raise funds through either the sale of its securities, issuance of corporate bonds, joint venture agreements and/or bank financing to accomplish its goals.\nIf additional financing is not available when needed, we may need to cease operations. The Company may not be successful in raising the capital needed to drill and/or rework existing oil wells. Any additional wells that the Company may drill may be non-productive. Management believes that actions presently being taken to secure additional funding for the reworking of its existing assets will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. Since the Company has an oil producing asset, its goal is to increase the production rate by optimizing its current infrastructure. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern; no adjustments to the financial statements have been made to account for this uncertainty.\nNOTE 4. EVALUATED PROPERTIES\nThe acquired properties and current properties can be summarized as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF COMPANYS CURRENT PROPERTIES\nCost Canadian properties US properties Total\nAs of December 31, 2019 2,563,434 $ 10,350,538 $ 12,913,972\nAdditions 678,765 - 678,765\nDispositions - (5,648,994 ) (5,648,994 )\nImpairment of oil and gas properties\n(396,922 ) (396,922 )\nAsset retirement cost additions 906,146 - 906,146\nForeign currency translations 166,460 - 166,460\nAs of December 31, 2020 $ 4,314,805 $ 4,304,622 $ 8,619,427\nAdditions 787,250 - 787,250\nDispositions (2,563,434 ) - (2,563,434 )\nForeign currency translation (46,218 ) - (46,218 )\nAs of December 31, 2021 $ 2,492,403 $ 4,304,622 $ 6,797,025\nAccumulated depletion\nAs of December 31, 2019 1,458,976 61,551 1,520,347\nDepletion 1,115,595 - 1,115,595\nForeign currency translations 57,178 - 57,178\nAs of December 31, 2020 $ 2,631,749 $ 61,551 $ 2,693,300\nDispositions (2,629,672 ) - (2,629,672 )\nDepletion 378,306 - 378,306\nForeign currency translation 7,026 - 7,026\nAs of December 31, 2021 $ 387,409 $ 61,551 $ 448,960\nNet book value as at December 31, 2021 $ 2,104,994 $ 4,243,071 $ 6,348,065\nNet book value as at December 31, 2020 $ 1,683,056 $ 4,243,071 $ 5,926,127\nU.S. Properties - Minerva-Rockdale Field (NOACK) Field\nOn November 1, 2018, the Company sold 83% leasehold net revenue interest and 100% working interest in the NOACK Field Assets, i.e., the Companys leasehold in the Noack Farms, Minera Lease and all related leases and assets located in Milam County, Texas (the NOACK Assets) to Crossroads Petroleum LLC (CP) for $375,000. The terms of this agreement included $260,000 to be paid as a deposit with the balance of $115,000 to be paid by December 31, 2018. On April 15, 2019, the Company foreclosed on the property since CP did not satisfy all of the contractual payment requirements. On April 15, 2019, the remaining unpaid receivable balance was $120,000 which was written off as a loss on sale of property. Note that previous payments of $255,000 were forfeited to the Company and no reimbursement to CP was made.\nOn August 6, 2019, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) for the sale of the same NOACK property with Flowtex Energy LLC. (FT). The purchaser agreed to pay $400,000 for the NOACK Assets including a $20,000 deposit that was received on August 15, 2019, and the remaining balance of $380,000 to be received by September 30, 2019. By December 31, 2020, FT had made cumulative payments of $375,000, resulting in a $25,000 account receivable to the Company at December 31, 2020 which is included in other current assets. The $400,000 was recorded as a gain on sale of properties. On July 6, 2021, the remaining $25,000 accounts receivable was settled via the following. The purchaser remitted a cash payment of $8,995, as well as paying (on the Companys behalf) $16,005 of outstanding property tax invoices previously incurred by the Company.\nU.S. Properties - Slick Unit Dutcher Sands (SUDS) Field\nThe SUDS Field is a 2604-acre lease located in Creek County, Oklahoma. The field was first discovered in 1918 by SOHIO Oil Company utilizing over 100 wells with the primary objective to produce from the Dutcher Sands at an average well depth of 3,100 ft. The SUDS field is currently shut in due to damage from a grass fire.\nU.S. properties - Twin Lakes San Andres Unit (TLSAU) Field\nTLSAU is located 45 miles from Roswell, Chaves County, New Mexico.\nOn July 27, 2020 the Company entered into a settlement agreement with their Trustee pursuant to which nine leases totaling approximately 3,800 acres of the 4,880 acre Twin Lakes San Andres Unit were forfeited as a part of the settlement agreement. Consequently, the Company no longer has the right to produce oil, gas, or other hydrocarbons and any other minerals from the mineral estate encumbered by the leases and owned by the Trustee. The company accounted for the forfeiture of the TLSAU properties, in accordance with Reg S-W.T.Rule 4-10(c)(6). Accordingly, an analysis of multi-period reserve reports was performed to determine the percentage of the cumulative US full cost pools reserves that were forfeited (56% or 943,820). Then that percentage was multiplied by the period end net property balance of $10,175,456. This resulted in a write down of $5,648,994 ($10,175,456 * 56%) of the US cost pool. Note that both TLSAU and SUDS make up the US full cost pool.\nLuseland, Hearts Hill and Cuthbert fields\nOn June 29, 2018, the Company acquired a 25% working interest in approximately 41,526 acres located in the Luseland, Hearts Hill, and Cuthbert fields, located in Southwest Saskatchewan and Eastern Alberta, Canada. The working interest was acquired from Blue Sky (a related party). Blue Sky had previously acquired an 80% working interest in the Canadian Properties from Georox Resources Inc., who had acquired the Canadian Properties from Cona Resources Ltd. and Cona Resources Partnership prior to the acquisition by the Company.\nThe effective date of the acquisition was June 1, 2018. The acquisition of the Canadian Properties was evidenced and documented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Company and Blue Sky dated June 29, 2018 and a Conveyance between the parties dated as of the same date, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire the Working Interest in consideration for $1,428,581 in Canadian dollars (CAD) (approximately $1,096,216 in U.S. dollars) of which CAD $1,022,400 (approximately $782,441 in U.S. dollars) was paid in cash (the Cash Payment) and CAD $406,181 (approximately $313,775 in U.S. dollars) was evidenced by a promissory note (the Acquisition Note). The Cash Payment was made with funds borrowed by the Company pursuant to the terms of that certain $1,530,000 May 9, 2018, Amended and Restated Loan Agreement entered with Bow and a third party (the Loan Agreement and the Lender). The amount owed under the Loan Agreement accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum (19% upon the occurrence of an event of default) and is due and payable on May 11, 2021.\nThe Working Interest will be held in the name of the Companys wholly owned Alberta, Canada, subsidiary, Petrolia Canada Corporation. The Acquisition Note which was dated June 8, 2018, bears interest at the rate of 9% per annum, beginning on August 1, 2018 and is due and payable on November 30, 2018, provided that the Company has the right to extend the maturity date for a period six months with 10 days notice to Blue Sky, in the event the Company pays 25% of the principal amount of the Acquisition Note at the time of extension.\nOn September 17, 2018, the Company entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Blue Sky. Pursuant to the MOU, the Company obtained the rights to acquire an additional 3% working interest in the Canadian Properties, increasing our Working Interest to 28%. Total consideration paid from the Company to Blue Sky for the additional 3% Working Interest was $150,000.\nOn February 16, 2022, the Company entered into both a Purchase and Sale Agreement and a Debt Settlement Agreement with Prospera Energy. Prospera agreed to purchase the Companys twenty-eight percent (28%) working interest in the Cuthbert, Luseland and Heart Hills assets in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Under these agreements Prospera will forgive $2,061,614 CAD in accounts payable from the Company, arising from joint interest billings. Prospera will also issue a $510,000 CAD convertible debenture to Petrolia Canada, which can be converted to common share units. Lastly, Prospera will pay the Company $75,000 CAD in five equal installments. The original purchase price of the assets was $1,622,756 CAD, with an additional $1,711,142 CAD of Asset Retirement Cost recognized at the time of purchase. On the effective date of the sale, the Asset Retirement Obligation was $2,312,897 CAD and the Accumulated Depletion was $3,333,898 CAD. The transaction resulted in a gain of $4,959,512 CAD ($3,919,323 USD) See Form 8-K reference in Exhibits section below. The agreement was effective on October 1, 2021.\nUtikuma field\nOn May 1, 2020, Petrolia Energy Corporation acquired a 50% working interest in approximately 28,000 acres located in the Utikuma Lake area in Alberta, Canada. The property is an oil-weighted asset currently producing approximately 500 bpd of light oil. The working interest was acquired from Blue Sky Resources Ltd. in an affiliated party transaction as Zel C. Khan, the Companys former Chief Executive Officer, is related to the ownership of Blue Sky. Blue Sky acquired a 100% working interest in the Canadian Property from Vermilion Energy Inc. via Vermilions subsidiary Vermilion Resources. The effective date of the acquisition was May 1, 2020. The total purchase price of the property was $2,000,000 (CAD), with $1,000,000 of that total due initially. The additional $1,000,000 was contingent on the future price of WTI crude. At the time WTI price exceeded $50/bbl, the Company would pay an additional $750,000 CAD. In addition, at the time WTI price exceeded $57/bbl the Company would pay an additional $250,000 CAD (for a cumulative contingent total of $1,000,000 CAD). The price of WTI crude exceeded $50/bbl on January 6, 2021 and exceeded $57/bbl on February 8, 2021. The additional payments due were netted with the accounts receivable balance from previous Joint Interest Billing statements from BSR. The total USD value of the addition was $787,250, using prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates. Included in the terms of the agreement, the Company also funded their portion of the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) bond fund requirement ($602,423 USD), necessary for the wells to continue in production after the acquisition. Additional funds ($386,989 USD) remain in the other current asset balance for future payments to BSR, related to the acquisition.\nOn December 2, 2020, Petrolia Canada Corporation received $602,404.84 CAD from the proceeds of a secured royalty interest loan between Blue Sky Resources and PrairieSky Royalty related to the Utikuma asset.\nOn August 21, 2021, the Company signed a Letter Agreement to divest the Companys wholly owned Canada subsidiary, Petrolia Canada Corporation (PCC) and its assets in consideration for $6,500,000 in Canadian dollars (approximately $5,150,000 in U.S. dollars) less any contingent liabilities. The buyer is Blue Sky Resources Ltd. (Blue Sky), an affiliated party to Zel C. Khan, the Companys former Chief Executive Officer. Petrolia Canada Corporation assets include a 50% working interest in approximately 28,000 acres located in the Utikuma Lake area in Alberta, Canada, and 28% working interest in the Luseland, Hearts Hill, and Cuthbert fields located in Southwest Saskatchewan and Eastern Alberta. The Company received a non-refundable deposit of $200,000 CAD on August 31, 2021. The remaining payment schedule is as follows: $2,000,000 CAD on the Closing Date (scheduled for September 30, 2021), $1,000,000 CAD on October 31, 2021, less Petrolias contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition of Utikuma, and $3,300,000 CAD on December 31, 2021. See Form 8-K reference in Exhibits section below. This transaction did not close, and the $200,000 CAD has currently been added to other payables to Blue Sky Resources.\nOn June 13, 2022, a new Letter Agreement was signed between Blue Sky Resources Ltd. (BSR) and Petrolia Energy Corporation whereby Petrolia Canada Corporation (PCC) will sell to Blue Sky Resources its 50% working interest in the Utikuma Lake oil field.

The Loan Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including cross defaults under other indebtedness obligations of us and Bow, and the occurrence of any event which would have a material adverse effect on us or Bow. The Company is required to make principal payments of $10,000 per month from January through September 2019 with the remaining balance of $710,000 due at maturity on May 11, 2021.

Upon the disposition of Bow, a total of $730,000 of the obligations owed under the Loan Agreement were transferred to Blue Sky Resources Ltd. (Blue Sky).\nIn order to induce the Lender to enter into the Loan Agreement, the Company agreed to issue the Lender 500,000 shares of restricted common stock (the Loan Shares), which were issued on May 18, 2018, and warrants to purchase 2,320,000 shares of common stock (the Loan Warrants), of which warrants to purchase (a) 320,000 shares of common stock have an exercise price of $0.10 per share in Canadian dollars and expire in May 15, 2021, (b) 500,000 shares of common stock have an exercise price of $0.12 per share in U.S. dollars, and expire on May 15, 2021; and (c) 1,500,000 shares of common stock have an exercise price of $0.10 per share in U.S. dollars and expire on May 15, 2020. The fair value of the 500,000 common shares issued were assessed at the market price of the stock on the date of issuance and valued at $47,500. The fair value of the Canadian dollar denominated warrants issued were assessed at $30,012 using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value of the U.S. dollar denominated warrants issued were assessed at $182,650 using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model. The Company determined the debt modification to be an extinguishment of debt and recorded a total loss on extinguishment of debt of $260,162.\nOn January 1, 2021, the Lender signed an amended loan agreement, combining Credit note I and $200,000 of Credit note II which moved the balance of this note to credit note VI and accrued interest.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Lender signed another amended loan agreement, combining the new note with the combined note of Credit note III and $146,038 of Credit note II and accrued interest on those amounts to Credit note V.

LEASES\nOur adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and subsequent ASUs related to Topic 842, requires us to recognize substantially all leases on the balance sheet as an ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures as detailed below. We adopted this standard on the effective date of January 1, 2019 and used this effective date as the date of initial application. Under this application method, we were not required to restate prior period financial information or provide Topic 842 disclosures for prior periods. We elected the \u2018package of practical expedients, which permitted us to not reassess our prior conclusions related to lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs, and we did not elect the use of hindsight.\nLease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date of the lease, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. When readily determinable, we use the implicit rate in determining the present value of lease payments. When leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including the lease term.\nShort-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any short-term leases.\nThe tables below present financial information associated with our lease.\nSCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION LEASE\nBalance Sheet Classification December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nRight-of-use assets Other long-term assets 12,821 23,145\nCurrent lease liabilities Other current liabilities 13,909 13,107\nNon-current lease liabilities Other long-term liabilities - 13,909\nAs of December 31, 2021, our maturities of our lease liability are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF MATURITIES LEASE LIABILITY\n$ 13,909\nTotal $ 13,909\nLess: Imputed interest (1,088 )\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 12,821\nNOTE 7.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has a number of oil and gas wells in production and will have AROs once the wells are permanently removed from service. The primary obligations involve the removal and disposal of surface equipment, plugging and abandoning the wells and site restoration.\nPetrolia Energy Corporation (Petrolia or the Company) is the operator of certain wells located in New Mexico, at the Twin Lakes San Andres Unit (TLSAU) Field. TLSAU is located 45 miles from Roswell, Chaves County, New Mexico.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Company received a letter from the Commissioner of Public Lands of the State of New Mexico, which was sent to us and certain other parties notifying such parties of certain non-compliance with the laws and regulations that it administers. The deficiencies are currently in the process of being settled by a third party agreeing to plug six wells, including at least two Company operated wells (TLSAU wells #316 and #037). The scope of the matter above included only 240 acres of the 640 acres of The New Mexico State Land Office (SLO) lease. The Commissioner of Public Lands of the State of New Mexico could still file suit and require the plugging and surface remediation of all wells in section 36.\nOn April 8, 2021, the State of New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Oil Conservation Division (OCD) sent the Company a Notice of Violation alleging that the Company was not in compliance with certain New Mexico Oil and Gas Act regulations (the NMAC), associated with required reporting, inactive wells and financial assurance requirements, plugging certain abandoned wells, providing required financial assurance in connection with plugging expenses, and proposing to assess certain civil penalties in the amount of an aggregate of approximately $35,100.\nAs previously reported and in Petrolias Form 8-K dated October 25, 2021 (reference to which is hereby made), on April 8, 2021, the State of New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, Oil Conservation Division (the OCD) issued a Notice of Violation (the NOV) to Petrolia alleging that the Company violated four regulations under Title 19, Chapter 15 of the New Mexico Administrative Code (the NMAC) by: (i) failing to file production reports for certain wells, (ii) exceeding the number of inactive wells allowed, (iii) failing to provide financial assurance in the amount required, and (iv) failing to provide additional financial assurance in the amount required.\nThe Company acknowledged the violations alleged in the NOV and requested an informal resolution. On December 30, 2021, to resolve this matter, Petrolia entered into a Stipulated Final Order ( the SFO) in Case No. 21982 with the OCD whereby Petrolia among other things agreed to: (i) submit appropriate forms for wells identified on the SFO Inactive Well List, (ii) plug the specific TLSAU wells listed in section 8 (c) and (d) of the SFO, as well as submit all required information and forms specified in the SFO, (iii) open an escrow account meeting the terms listed in the SFO, (iv) deposit funds into an escrow account within the timeframe described in the SFO, and (v) provide the OCD with a report proposing deadlines for bringing all remaining wells into compliance. The company recognized an additional liability of $792,000 to plug these wells.\nThe Company entered into a settlement agreement on July 27, 2020 with Moon Company, Trustee of the OBrien Mineral Trust pursuant to which nine leases totaling approximately 3,800 acres of the 4,880 acre Twin Lakes San Andres Unit were terminated as a part of the settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement agreement, the Company no longer has the right to produce oil, gas, or other hydrocarbons and any other minerals from the mineral estate encumbered by the leases and owned by the trustee of the OBrien Mineral Trust.\nAROs associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets in the period incurred. The fair value of AROs is recognized as of the acquisition date of the working interest. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depleted over the life of the asset. AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligations discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.

The total $USD value of the addition was $787,250, using prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates.\nSCHEDULE OF COSTS INCURRED IN OIL AND GAS PROPERTY ACQUISITION, EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nProperty acquisitions $ 787,250 $ 678,765\nUnevaluated - -\nEvaluated - -\nExploration - -\nDevelopment - -\nTotal costs incurred $ 787,250 $ 678,765\nCapitalized costs\nCapitalized costs include the cost of properties, equipment and facilities for oil and natural-gas producing activities, excluding any asset retirement obligations. Capitalized costs for proved properties include costs for oil and natural-gas leaseholds where proved reserves have been identified, development wells, and related equipment and facilities, including development wells in progress. Capitalized costs for unproved properties include costs for acquiring oil and gas leaseholds and geological and geophysical expenses where no proved reserves have been identified.\nSCHEDULE OF CAPITALIZED COSTS IN OIL AND GAS PROPERTY ACQUISITION, EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nCapitalized costs:\nUnevaluated properties $ - $ -\nEvaluated properties 5,511,480 6,456,367\nGross capitalized costs 5,511,480 6,456,367\nLess: Accumulated DD&A (448,960 ) (2,693,300 )\nNet capitalized costs $ 5,062,520 $ 3,763,067\nOil and Gas Reserve Information\nMKM Engineering (MKM), an independent engineering firm, prepared the estimates of the proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to the Chaves County, New Mexico and Creek County, Oklahoma and Canadian property leasehold interests as of December 31, 2021 and the estimates of the proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to the Milam County, Texas, Chaves County, New Mexico and Creek County, Oklahoma leasehold interests as of December 31, 2020. The estimated proved net recoverable reserves presented below include only those quantities that were expected to be commercially recoverable at prices and costs in effect at the balance sheet dates under the then existing regulatory practices and with conventional equipment and operating methods. Proved Developed Reserves represent only those reserves estimated to be recovered through existing wells. Proved Undeveloped Reserves include those reserves that may be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells on which a relatively major expenditure for recompletion or secondary recovery operations is required. All of the Companys Proved Reserves are located onshore in the continental United States of America and Canada.\nDiscounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties. Estimates of fair value should also consider unproved reserves, anticipated future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production costs and risks associated with future production. Because of these and other considerations, any estimate of fair value is subjective and imprecise.\nThe following table sets forth estimates of the proved oil and gas reserves (net of royalty interests) for the Company and changes therein, for the periods indicated.\nSCHEDULE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES\nOil (Bbls)\nDecember 31, 2019 1,800,457\nRevisions of prior estimates (860,450 )\nPurchases of reserves in place 466,800\nDisposition of mineral in place -\nProduction (95,135 )\nDecember 31, 2020 1,311,672\nRevisions of prior estimates 292,335\nPurchases of reserves in place -\nDisposition of mineral in place (57,070 )\nProduction (97,084 )\nDecember 31, 2021 1,449,853\nSCHEDULE OF PROVED DEVELOPMENT AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nEstimated quantities of proved developed reserves - Oil (Bbls) 1,449,853 1,245,512\nEstimated quantities of proved undeveloped reserves - Oil (Bbls) - 66,160\nProved developed and proved undeveloped reserves increased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, primarily due the revision of prior estimates, partially offset by the disposition of the CONA asset.\nThe following table sets forth estimates of the proved developed and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves (net of royalty interests) for the Company and changes therein, for the period indicates.\nProved developed producing and non-producing reserve Oil (bbls)\nDecember 31, 2020 1,245,512\nAcquired reserves -\nDisposition of reserves -\nRevision of prior estimates 301,425\nProduction (97,084 )\nDecember 31, 2021 1,449,853\nProved undeveloped reserves Oil (bbls)\nDecember 31, 2020 66,160\nDisposition of reserves (66,160 )\nRevisions to prior estimates -\nDecember 31, 2021 -\nStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows\nThe Standardized Measure related to proved oil and gas reserves is summarized below. Future cash inflows were computed by applying a twelve-month average of the first day of the month prices to estimated future production, less estimated future expenditures (based on year end costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less estimated future income tax expense. Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying appropriate year-end tax rates to future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of properties involved. Future net cash flows are discounted at a rate of 10% annually to derive the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This calculation procedure does not necessarily result in an estimate of the fair market value or the present value of the Company.\nStandardized Measure of Oil and Gas\nThe following table sets forth the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves for the periods indicated.\nSCHEDULE OF STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nFuture cash inflows $ 93,082,624 $ 47,647,500\nFuture production costs (45,892,778 ) (25,203,830 )\nFuture development costs (1,867,485 ) (2,148,510 )\nFuture income taxes - -\nFuture net cash flows 45,322,361 20,295,160\nDiscount of future net cash flows at 10% per annum 27,929,984 ) (12,339,240 )\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 17,392,377 $ 7,956,920\nChanges in standardized measure of discounted future cash flows\nSCHEDULE OF CHANGES IN STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nBeginning of year $ 7,956,920 $ 25,824,730\nSales and transfers of oil & gas produced, net of production costs (539,927\n) (735,300 )\nNet changes in prices and production costs (865,805\n) (249,508\nChanges in estimated future development costs (565,870\n) 96,780\nAcquisitions/dispositions of minerals in place, net of production costs (231,470 ) -\nRevision of previous estimates 1,194,016\n(14,938,598 )\nChange in discount - 436,490\nChange in production rate or other 10,444,513 (2,477,674 )\nEnd of year $ 17,392,377 $ 7,956,920\nNOTE 16.
