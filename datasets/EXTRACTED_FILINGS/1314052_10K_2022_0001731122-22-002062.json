    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview and Strategy\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics by applying precision medicine to central nervous system (CNS) diseases with high unmet need. We analyze genomic data from clinical trials to identify biomarkers, which we use in the analysis of our clinical trials.\nOur lead product candidate, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, is being developed to treat Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases, including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a rare severe neurological monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2).\nWe currently have two core programs and two seed programs. Our core programs are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development, in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.\nThe following table summarizes key information about our programs:\n* = Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA; Dashed lines indicate planned clinical trials to-date\nAnavex has a portfolio of compounds varying in sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) binding activities. The SIGMAR1 gene encodes the SIGMAR1 protein, which is an intracellular chaperone protein with important roles in cellular communication. SIGMAR1 is also involved in transcriptional regulation at the nuclear envelope and restores homeostasis and stimulates recovery of cell function when activated. In order to validate the ability of our compounds to activate quantitatively the SIGMAR1, we performed, in collaboration with Stanford University, a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging scan in mice, which demonstrated a dose-dependent ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 target engagement or receptor occupancy with SIGMAR1 in the brain.\nSource: Reyes S et al., Sci Rep. 2021 Aug 25;11(1):17150\nCellular Homeostasis\nMany diseases are possibly directly caused by chronic homeostatic imbalances or cellular stress of brain cells. In pediatric diseases, such as Rett syndrome or infantile spasms, the chronic cellular stress is possibly caused by the presence of a constant genetic mutation. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, chronic cellular stress is possibly caused by age-correlated buildup of cellular insult and hence chronic cellular stress. Specifically, defects in homeostasis of protein or ribonucleic acid (RNA) lead to the death of neurons and dysfunction of the nervous system. The spreading of protein aggregates resulting in a proteinopathy, a characteristic found in Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases that results from disorders of protein synthesis, trafficking, folding, processing or degradation in cells. The clearance of macromolecules in the brain is particularly susceptible to imbalances that result in aggregation and degeneration in nerve cells. For example, Alzheimers disease pathology is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles, which are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that are a marker of other diseases known as tauopathies as well as inflammation of microglia. With the SIGMAR1 activation through SIGMAR1 agonists like ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, our approach is to restore cellular balance (i.e. homeostasis). Therapies that correct defects in cellular homeostasis might have the potential to halt or delay neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease progression.\nANAVEX\u00ae2-73-specific Biomarkers\nAs part of some of our clinical trials, we have incorporated a genomic analysis to better understand potential populations for whom our clinical programs might benefit. In our clinical trials, a full genomic analysis of Alzheimers disease patients treated with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 has helped us identify actionable genetic variants. A significant impact of the genomic biomarkers SIGMAR1, the direct target of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 and COMT, a gene involved in memory function, on the drug response level was identified, leading to an early ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-specific biomarker hypothesis. We believe that excluding patients with SIGMAR1 identified biomarker variant (approximately 10%-20% of the population) in prospective studies would identify approximately 80%-90% patients that would display clinically significant improved functional and cognitive scores. The consistency between the identified DNA and RNA data related to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, which are considered independent of Alzheimers disease pathology, as well as multiple endpoints and time-points, provides support for the potential precision medicine clinical development of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 by using genetic biomarkers identified within the trial population itself to target patients who are most likely to respond to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 treatment. We may in the future utilize such an approach in Alzheimers disease as well as indications like Parkinsons disease dementia or Rett syndrome in which ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 is currently being studied.\nClinical Trials Overview\nAlzheimers Disease\nIn November 2016, we completed a Phase 2a clinical trial, consisting of Part A and Part B, which lasted a total of 57 weeks, for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimers patients. This open-label, randomized trial in Australia met both primary and secondary endpoints and was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in 32 patients. ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimers disease. In October 2017, we presented positive pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data from the Phase 2a clinical trial, which established a concentration-effect relationship between ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 and trial measurements. These measures obtained from all patients who participated in the entire 57 weeks include exploratory cognitive and functional scores as well as biomarker signals of brain activity. Additionally, the clinical trial appeared to show that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 activity was enhanced by its active metabolite (ANAVEX19-144), which also targets the SIGMAR1 receptor and has a half-life approximately twice as long as the parent molecule.\nTwo consecutive trial extensions for the Phase 2a trial have allowed participants who completed the 52-week Part B of the trial to continue taking ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, providing us an opportunity to gather extended safety data for a cumulative time period of five years. In August 2020, patients completing these Phase 2a trial extensions were granted continued access to treatment with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 through the Australian Government Department of Health - Therapeutic Goods Administrations compassionate use Special Access Scheme.\nA larger Phase 2b/3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in Alzheimers disease commenced in August 2018. The Phase 2b/3 trial enrolled 509 patients for 48 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 doses or placebo. The trial commenced in Australia; and during fiscal 2020 additional regions were added in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany and Canada. Primary and secondary endpoints will assess safety and both cognitive and functional efficacy, measured through Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog), ADCS-ADL and Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes for cognition and function (CDR-SB). In addition to the primary endpoints, the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2b/3 trial design incorporated pre-specified statistical analyses related to potential genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2a clinical trial. The trial completed enrollment in June 2021, exceeding the 450 patient enrollment target at 52 sites across Canada, Europe and Australia.\nIn October 2019, we initiated a long-term open label extension study of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, entitled the ATTENTION-AD trial, for patients who have completed the 48-week Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled trial referenced above. This trial extension for an additional two years gives patients the opportunity to continue their treatment. Upon request by patients, caretakers and investigators, this extension trial was extended by one additional year.\nRett Syndrome\nIn February 2016, we presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disease. The data demonstrated dose related and significant improvements in an array of behavioral and gait paradigms in a mouse model with a MECP2-null mutation that causes neurological symptoms that mimic Rett syndrome. The study was funded by the International Rett Syndrome Foundation (Rettsyndrome.org). In January 2017, we were awarded a financial grant from Rettsyndrome.org of a minimum of $0.6 million to cover some of the costs of a multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. This award was received in quarterly instalments which commenced during fiscal 2018.\nIn March 2019, we commenced the first Phase 2 clinical trial in a planned Rett syndrome program of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The clinical trials are being conducted in a range of patient age demographics and geographic regions, utilizing an oral liquid once-daily formulation of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73.\nThe first Phase 2 trial, (ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-RS-001), which took place in the United States, was completed in December 2020. This trial was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy trial of oral liquid ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 formulation in 25 adult female patients with Rett syndrome over a 7-week treatment period including ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-specific genomic precision medicine biomarkers. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety. The dosing of 5 mg ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 was well-tolerated and demonstrated dose-proportional PK. All secondary efficacy endpoints of the trial showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful response in the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ) response, when compared to placebo, in the intent to treat (ITT) cohort (all participants, p = 0.011). 66.7% of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 treated subjects showed a statistically significant improvement in RSBQ response as compared to 10% of the subjects on placebo in the ITT cohort (all participants, p = 0.011). ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 treatment resulted in a sustained improvement in Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) response throughout the 7-week clinical trial, when compared to placebo in the ITT cohort (all participants, p = 0.014). Consistent with previous ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 clinical trials, patients carrying the common form of the SIGMAR1 gene treated with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 experienced stronger improvements in the prespecified efficacy endpoints.\nThe second, international trial of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome, called the AVATAR trial, commenced in June 2019. This trial took place in Australia and the United Kingdom using a higher dose than the U.S. based Phase 2 trial for Rett syndrome. The trial was a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in 33 adult patients over a 7-week treatment period including ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 specific precision medicine biomarkers. Based upon the input from the successful U.S. Phase 2 Rett syndrome trial (ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-RS-001), we updated the endpoints for the AVATAR trial (ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-RS-002) to appropriately assess the clinically meaningful outcome following International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. These updates were approved by the respective regulatory authorities in the U.K. and in Australia, respectively, where the AVATAR trial was conducted.\nThe data from the AVATAR trial was released in February 2022. The clinical trial met all primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints, with consistent improvements in primary efficacy endpoint, RSBQ response (p = 0.037), and secondary efficacy endpoints, ADAMS (p = 0.010) and CGI-I (p = 0.037) response. Efficacy endpoints demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in Rett syndrome symptoms. Convenient once daily oral liquid doses of up to 30 mg of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 were also well tolerated with good medication compliance. All patients who participated in the trial were eligible to receive ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 under a voluntary open label extension protocol.\nIn July 2020, we commenced the third trial of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome, called the EXCELLENCE trial. This Phase 2/3 trial in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome includes trial sites in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in approximately 84 pediatric patients, aged 5 to 18, over a 12-week treatment period incorporating ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 specific precision medicine biomarkers. All patients who participate in the trial will be eligible to receive ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 under a voluntary open label extension protocol, which is currently ongoing.\nParkinsons Disease\nIn September 2016, we presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in an animal model of Parkinsons disease, which demonstrated significant improvements on behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. The study was funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Additional data announced in October 2017 indicated that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 induced robust neurorestoration in experimental Parkinsonism. We believe that the encouraging results we have gathered in this preclinical model, coupled with the favorable profile of this product candidate in the Alzheimers disease trial, support the notion that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 has the potential to treat Parkinsons disease dementia.\nIn October 2020, we completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in Parkinsons disease dementia in Spain and Australia, to study the effect of the compound on both the cognitive and motor impairment of Parkinsons disease. The Phase 2 trial enrolled approximately 132 patients for 14 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 doses, 30 mg and 50 mg, or placebo. The ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2 Parkinsons disease dementia trial design incorporated genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2a Alzheimers disease trial.\nThe trial demonstrated that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 was safe and well tolerated in oral doses up to 50 mg once daily. The results showed clinically meaningful, dose-dependent, and statistically significant improvements in the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerized assessment system analysis. Treatment with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 also resulted in clinically meaningful improvements as measured by the global composite score of Parkinsons disease symptom severity, MDS-Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale total score on top of standard of care including dopaminergic therapy, levodopa and other anti-PD medications after 14 weeks of treatment, suggesting ANAVEX\u00ae2-73s potential capability of slowing and reversing symptoms that progress in Parkinsons disease. In addition, the trial confirmed the precision medicine approach of targeting SIGMAR1 as a genetic biomarker in response to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 may result in improved clinical outcomes.\nIn January 2021, we were awarded a research grant of $1.0 million from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research to develop ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of Parkinsons disease. The award will explore utilization of PET imaging biomarkers to enable measurement of target engagement and pathway activation of the SIGMAR1 with clinically relevant doses in people with Parkinsons disease.\nFrontotemporal Dementia\nIn July 2020, we commenced the First-in-Human Phase 1 clinical trial of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71. ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 was previously granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) by the FDA. ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 is an orally administered small molecule targeting sigma-1 and M1 muscarinic receptors that is designed to be beneficial for neurodegenerative diseases. In preclinical studies, ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 demonstrated disease-modifying activity against the major hallmarks of Alzheimers disease in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, as well as beneficial effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation.\nThe Phase 1 clinical trial was a prospective double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Australia. A total of 36 healthy male and female subjects were included. Single escalating doses of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 were administered in order to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 and the effects of food and gender on its PK in healthy volunteers.\nThe trial met its primary and secondary endpoints of safety, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose-limiting toxicities observed. ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 was well tolerated in all cohorts receiving ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 in single doses ranging from 5 mg to 200 mg daily with no SAEs and no significant lab abnormalities in any subject. In the trial, ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 exhibited linear PK. Its pharmacokinetics was also dose proportional for doses up to 160 mg. Gender had no effect on the PK of the drug and food had no effect on the bioavailability of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71. The trial also met the secondary objective of characterizing the effect of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. There were no clinically significant ECG parameters throughout the trial. Participant QTcF measures were normal across all dose groups with no difference between ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 and placebo.\nBased on these results, and ANAVEX\u00ae3-71s pre-clinical profile, we intend to advance ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 into a biomarker-driven clinical development dementia program for the treatment of schizophrenia, FTD and Alzheimers disease, evaluating longitudinal effect of treatment with ANAVEX\u00ae3-71. We believe the results of these clinical trials and preclinical study could serve as the basis for advancing into respective registration studies in the U.S.\nOur Pipeline\nOur research and development pipeline includes ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 currently in three different clinical trial indications, and several other compounds in different stages of clinical and pre-clinical development.\nOur proprietary SIGMACEPTOR\u2122 Discovery Platform produced small molecule drug candidates with unique modes of action, based on our understanding of sigma receptors. Sigma receptors may be targets for therapeutics to combat many human diseases, both of neurodegenerative nature, including Alzheimers disease, as well as of neurodevelopmental nature, like Rett syndrome. When bound by the appropriate ligands, sigma receptors influence the functioning of multiple biochemical signals that are involved in the pathogenesis (origin or development) of disease. Multiple viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) induce cellular stress by intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis and other related cellular processes, in order to ensure survival and replication. Hence, it is possible that SIGMAR1 could play a role in modulating the cellular response to viral infection and ameliorate pathogenesis.\nCompounds that have been subjects of our research include the following:\nANAVEX\u00ae2-73 (blarcamesine)\nWe believe ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 may offer a disease-modifying approach in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases by activation of SIGMAR1. ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 is being developed in an oral liquid once-daily formulation for rare diseases such as Rett syndrome as well as an oral once-daily capsule formulation for diseases such as Alzheimers disease.\nIn Rett syndrome, administration of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in liquid form resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease model. In addition, in a further experiment sponsored by Rettsyndrome.org, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 was evaluated in automatic visual response and respiration tests in 7-month old mice, an age at which advanced pathology is evident. Vehicle-treated MECP2 mice demonstrated fewer automatic visual responses than wild-type mice. Treatment with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for four weeks significantly increased the automatic visual response in the MECP2 Rett syndrome disease mice. Additionally, chronic oral dosing daily for 6.5 weeks of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 starting at ~5.5 weeks of age was conducted in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease mouse model assessed the different aspects of muscular coordination, balance, motor learning and muscular strengths, some of the core deficits observed in Rett syndrome. Administration of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of these behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease model.\nIn May 2016 and June 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of Rett syndrome and infantile spasms, respectively. In November 2019, the FDA granted to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 the Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The RPD designation is intended to encourage the development of treatments for rare pediatric diseases.\nFurther, in February 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 clinical development program for the treatment of Rett syndrome. The FDA Fast Track program is designed to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious and life-threatening conditions.\nFor Parkinsons disease, data demonstrates significant improvements and restoration of function in a disease modifying animal model of Parkinsons disease. Significant improvements were seen on all measures tested: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. In October 2020, we completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in Parkinsons disease dementia, to study the effect of the compound on both the cognitive and motor impairment of Parkinsons disease. The Phase 2 trial enrolled approximately 132 patients for 14 weeks, randomized 1:1:1 to two different ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 doses, 30 mg and 50 mg, or placebo. The ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2 Parkinsons disease dementia trial design incorporated genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2a Alzheimers disease trial.\nThe trial demonstrated that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 was safe and well tolerated in oral doses up to 50 mg once daily. The results showed clinically meaningful, dose-dependent, and statistically significant improvements in the CDR computerized assessment system analysis. We anticipate conducting further clinical trials of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in Parkinsons disease dementia after submitting the results of the trial to the FDA to obtain regulatory guidance.\nIn Alzheimers disease animal models, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 has shown pharmacological, histological and behavioral evidence as a potential neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive and anti-depressive therapeutic agent, due to its potent affinity to SIGMAR1 and moderate affinities to M1-4 type muscarinic receptors. In addition, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 has shown a potential dual mechanism which may impact amyloid, tau pathology and inflammation. In a transgenic Alzheimers disease animal model Tg2576, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 induced a statistically significant neuroprotective effect against the development of oxidative stress in the mouse brain, as well as significantly increased the expression of functional and synaptic plasticity markers that is apparently amyloid-beta independent. It also statistically alleviated the learning and memory deficits developed over time in the animals, regardless of sex, both in terms of spatial working memory and long-term spatial reference memory.\nBased on the results of pre-clinical testing, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73. In this Phase 1 SAD trial, the maximum tolerated single dose was defined per protocol as 55-60 mg. This dose is above the equivalent dose shown to have positive effects in mouse models of Alzheimers disease. There were no significant changes in laboratory or ECG parameters. ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 was well tolerated below the 55-60 mg dose with only mild adverse events in some subjects. Observed adverse events at doses above the maximum tolerated single dose included headache and dizziness, which were moderate in severity and reversible. These side effects are often seen with drugs that target CNS conditions, including Alzheimers disease.\nIn November 2016, we completed a Phase 2a clinical trial for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. The open-label randomized trial was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in 32 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimers disease. The Phase 2a trial met both primary and secondary objectives of the trial.\nIn July 2018, we presented the results of a genomic DNA and RNA evaluation of the participants in the Phase 2a clinical trial. More than 33,000 genes were analyzed using unbiased, data driven, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) system for analyzing DNA and RNA data in patients treated with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73. The analysis identified genetic variants that impacted response to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, among them variants related to the SIGMAR1, the target for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73. Results showed that trial participants with the common SIGMAR1 wild type gene variant, which is estimated to be about 80% of the population worldwide, demonstrated improved cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) scores. The results from this evaluation supported the continued evaluation of genomic information in subsequent clinical trials, since these signatures can now be applied to neurological indications tested in future clinical trials with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 including Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease dementia and Rett syndrome.\nANAVEX\u00ae2-73 data met prerequisite information in order to progress into a Phase 2b/3 placebo-controlled trial. On July 2, 2018, the Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia approved the initiation of our Phase 2b/3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 48-week safety and efficacy trial of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for the treatment of early Alzheimers disease. Clinical trial sites in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany were also added. This Phase 2b/3 trial design incorporates inclusion of genomic precision medicine biomarkers identified in the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 Phase 2a trial. The Phase 2b/3 trial, which has completed enrollment, randomized 1:1:1 to either two different ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 doses or placebo.\nWe believe preclinical data from our studies also supports ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 as a potential platform drug for other neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease or Rett syndrome, more specifically, epilepsy, infantile spasms, Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, multiple sclerosis and, more recently, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 demonstrated significant improvements in all of these indications in the respective preclinical animal models.\nIn a preclinical study sponsored by the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 was assessed in a mouse model for the development of audiogenic seizures. The results indicated that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 administration significantly reduced audiogenic-induced seizures. In a study sponsored by FRAXA Research Foundation regarding Fragile X syndrome, data demonstrated that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 restored hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression to normal levels. BDNF under-expression has been observed in many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative pathologies. BDNF signaling promotes maturation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 normalization of BDNF expression could be a contributing factor for the positive data observed in both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders like Angelman and Fragile X syndromes.\nIn addition, preclinical data to-date also indicates that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 has the potential to demonstrate protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.\nIn addition, preclinical data on ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 related to multiple sclerosis indicates that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 may promote remyelination in multiple sclerosis disease. Further, our data also demonstrates that ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 has the potential to provide protection for oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), as well as central nervous system neurons in addition to helping repair by increasing OPC proliferation and maturation in tissue culture.\nIn March 2018, we presented preclinical data of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 in a genetic mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous benign tumors in many parts of the body with a high incidence of seizures. The preclinical data demonstrated that treatment with ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 significantly increased survival and reduced seizures in those mice.\nANAVEX\u00ae3-71\nANAVEX\u00ae3-71 is a clinical drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action via SIGMAR1 activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has been shown to enhance neuroprotection and cognition in Alzheimers disease models. ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 is a CNS-penetrable potential disease modifying treatment for cognitive impairments. We believe it is effective in very small doses against the major Alzheimers hallmarks in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 indicates extensive therapeutic advantages in Alzheimers and other protein-aggregation-related diseases given its ability to enhance neuroprotection and cognition via SIGMAR1 activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation.\nA preclinical study examined the response of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 in aged transgenic animal models and showed a significant reduction in the rate of cognitive deficit, amyloid beta pathology and inflammation with the administration of ANAVEX 3-71. In April 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 for the treatment of FTD.\nDuring pathological conditions ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 demonstrated the formation of new synapses between neurons (synaptogenesis) without causing an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, synaptogenesis is believed to be impaired. Additional preclinical data presented also indicates that in addition to reducing oxidative stress, ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 has the potential to demonstrate protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.\nIn July 2020, we commenced the first Phase 1 clinical trial of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71. The trial took place in Australia and was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 trial to evaluate safety and tolerability, and PK of oral escalating doses of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 including effects of food and gender in healthy volunteers. The trial met its primary and secondary endpoints of safety, respectively with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose-limiting toxicities observed, as more fully described above under Clinical Trials Overview - Frontotemporal Dementia.\nBased on these results, and ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 pre-clinical profile, the Company intends to advance ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 into a biomarker-driven clinical development dementia program for the treatment of schizophrenia, FTD and Alzheimers disease, evaluating longitudinal effect of treatment with ANAVEX\u00ae3-71. We believe the results of this clinical trial and preclinical study could serve as a basis for advancing into respective registration trials in the U.S.\nANAVEX\u00ae1-41\nANAVEX\u00ae1-41 is a sigma-1 agonist. Pre-clinical tests revealed significant neuroprotective benefits (i.e., protects nerve cells from degeneration or death) through the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, which damages and impairs cell viability. In addition, in animal models, ANAVEX\u00ae1-41 prevented the expression of caspase-3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and loss of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that regulates learning, emotion and memory. These activities involve both muscarinic and SIGMAR1 systems through a novel mechanism of action.\nPreclinical data presented also indicates that ANAVEX\u00ae1-41 has the potential to demonstrate protective effects of mitochondrial enzyme complexes during pathological conditions, which, if impaired, are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.\nANAVEX\u00ae1066\nANAVEX\u00ae1066, a mixed sigma-1/sigma-2 ligand is designed for the potential treatment of neuropathic and visceral pain. ANAVEX\u00ae1066 was tested in two preclinical models of neuropathic and visceral pain that have been extensively validated in rats. In the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain, a single oral administration of ANAVEX\u00ae1066 dose-dependently restored the nociceptive threshold in the affected paw to normal levels while leaving the contralateral healthy paw unchanged. Efficacy was rapid and remained significant for two hours. In a model of visceral pain, chronic colonic hypersensitivity was induced by injection of an inflammatory agent directly into the colon and a single oral administration of ANAVEX\u00ae1066 returned the nociceptive threshold to control levels in a dose-dependent manner. Companion studies in rats demonstrated the lack of any effects on normal gastrointestinal transit with ANAVEX\u00ae1066 and a favorable safety profile in a battery of behavioral measures.\nANAVEX\u00ae1037\nANAVEX\u00ae1037 is designed for the treatment of prostate and pancreatic cancer. It is a low molecular weight, synthetic compound exhibiting high affinity for SIGMAR1 at nanomolar levels and moderate affinity for sigma-2 receptors and sodium channels at micromolar levels. In advanced pre-clinical studies, this compound revealed antitumor potential. It has also been shown to selectively kill human cancer cells without affecting normal/healthy cells and also to significantly suppress tumor growth in immune-deficient mice models. Scientific publications highlight the possibility that these ligands may stop tumor growth and induce selective cell death in various tumor cell lines. Sigma receptors are highly expressed in different tumor cell types. Binding by appropriate sigma-1 and/or sigma-2 ligands can induce selective apoptosis. In addition, through tumor cell membrane reorganization and interactions with ion channels, we believe our drug candidates may play an important role in inhibiting the processes of metastasis (spreading of cancer cells from the original site to other parts of the body), angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and tumor cell proliferation.\nANAVEX\u00ae1037 is currently in the pre-clinical and clinical testing stages of development, and there is no guarantee that the activity demonstrated in pre-clinical models will be shown in human testing.\nWe continue to identify and initiate discussions with potential strategic and commercial partners to most effectively advance our programs and increase stockholder value. Further, we may acquire or develop new intellectual property and assign, license, or otherwise transfer our intellectual property to further our goals.\nOur Target Indications\nWe are developing compounds with potential application to two broad categories and several specific indications, including:\nCentral Nervous System Diseases\n\u25cf Alzheimers disease - In 2022, an estimated 6.5 million Americans were suffering from Alzheimers disease. The Alzheimers Association\u00ae estimates that by 2050, this number is expected to rise to 12.7 million Americans. Medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimers disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. We believe there is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease modifying cure for Alzheimers disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments.\n\u25cf Parkinsons disease - Parkinsons disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow, imprecise movement. It is associated with degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain and a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Parkinsons disease currently is estimated to afflict more than 10 million people worldwide, typically middle-aged and elderly people. The Parkinsons disease market is expected to reach to $11.5 billion by 2029, according to GlobalData.\n\u25cf Rett syndrome - Rett syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops, including protein transcription, which is altered and as a result leads to severe disruptions in neuronal homeostasis. It is considered a rare, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder and is caused by a single mutation in the MECP2 gene. Because males have a different chromosome combination from females, boys who have the genetic MECP2 mutation are affected in devastating ways. Most of them die before birth or in early infancy. For females who survive infancy, Rett syndrome leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the childs life; severe mental retardation, their ability to speak, walk and eat, sleeping problems, seizures and even the ability to breathe easily. Rett syndrome affects approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 females.\n\u25cf Depression - Depression is a major cause of morbidity worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The global antidepressant drug market is projected to reach $21 Billion by 2030 according to Allied Market Research. Pharmaceutical treatment for depression has been historically dominated by blockbuster brands. However, the dominance of the leading brands is waning, largely due to an increase in the number of approvals for antidepressant drugs.\n\u25cf Epilepsy - Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2015 epilepsy affected 3.4 million Americans. Today, epilepsy is often controlled, but not cured, with medication that is categorized as older traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs. Because epilepsy afflicts sufferers in different ways, there is a need for drugs used in combination with both traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs.\n\u25cf Neuropathic Pain - We define neuralgia, or neuropathic pain, as pain that is not related to activation of pain receptor cells in any part of the body. Neuralgia is more difficult to treat than some other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. Special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants.\nCancer\n\u25cf Malignant Melanoma - Predominantly a skin cancer, malignant melanoma can also occur in melanocytes found in the bowel and the eye. Malignant melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor, adjuvant treatment, chemo and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. According to iHealthcareAnalyst, Inc. the worldwide malignant melanoma market is expected to grow to $7.5 billion by 2029.\n\u25cf Prostate Cancer - Specific to men, prostate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Cancer cells may metastasize from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. Drug therapeutics for prostate cancer are expected to increase to nearly $10.1 billion by the end of 2030 according to Market Research Future.\n\u25cf Pancreatic Cancer - Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas. In the United States, approximately 62,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed this year and approximately 50,000 patients will die as a result of their cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Sales predictions by Market Data Forecast predict that the market for the global pharmaceutical treatment of pancreatic cancer will increase from $2.59 billion in 2022 to $3.73 billion by 2027.\nCompetition\nThe drug discovery and development industry is very competitive, characterized by rapid advancements in technology, where protection of proprietary advancements is essential. Any product candidates that we may successfully develop and commercialize, may compete with existing therapies, or new therapies that may become available in the future. Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.\nWe believe our approach to the treatment of Alzheimers disease and other CNS diseases differs from our competitors - our platform may offer a disease-modifying approach in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases by activation of SIGMAR1. In our preclinical studies, when activated by SIGMAR1 agonists, such as ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, SIGMAR1 demonstrated reduced cellular stress before and after RNA gene transcription. Our studies confirm the potential existence of a predictive biomarker of response established through SIGMAR1 mRNA expression that could be used in future clinical trials. Because of its role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis, we believe sigma receptors show significant promise as viable targets for therapeutic molecules in an effort to treat Alzheimers disease and other CNS diseases and disorders, including Parkinsons disease and Rett syndrome, by restoring healthy gene expression.\nAt this time, our competitors are primarily other biomedical development companies that are aiming to discover and develop compounds to be used in the treatment of Alzheimers disease and other CNS diseases, and those companies already doing so. We also face competition from academic institutions and government agencies, both in the United States and abroad.\nOur competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, an established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, may be in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing of approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and technical personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring or developing technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nFor additional discussion of the risks related to competition, see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Company\nWe have had a history of losses and no revenue, which raises a risk regarding our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.\nSince inception through September 30, 2022, we have accumulated a deficit of approximately $246 million. We can offer no assurance that we will ever operate profitably or that we will generate positive cash flow in the future. To date, we have not generated any revenues from our operations. Our history of losses and no revenues creates a greater risk of our continued ability to continue as a going concern in the future. As a result, our management expects the business to continue to experience negative cash flows for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever, our business might become profitable. We will need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. This may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an early clinical stage pharmaceutical research and development company and may never be able to successfully develop marketable products or generate any revenue. We have a very limited relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. There is no assurance that our future operations will result in profits. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe are an early clinical stage company and have not generated any revenues to date and have no operating history. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our research and development efforts will be successful or, if successful, that our potential drug compounds will ever be approved for sales to pharmaceutical companies or generate commercial revenues. We have no relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. We are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise, including, but not limited to, risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of potential drug compounds either in non-clinical testing or in clinical trials, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages against larger and more established companies. If we fail to become profitable, we may suspend or cease operations.\nWe will need additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development activities.\nTo date, we have funded our operations primarily through private placement of our equity securities, grants and our at the market offering in connection with an Amended and Restated Sales Agreement, dated May 1, 2020, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and SVB Leerink LLC (the Sales Agents), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of common stock registered under an effective registration statement from time to time through the Sales Agents. We will need to raise additional funding and the current economic conditions may have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional needed capital on terms that are favorable to our Company or at all. We may not be able to generate significant revenues for several years, if at all. Until we can generate significant revenues, if ever, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through equity or debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research and development activities.\nRisks Related to our Business\nEven if we are able to develop our potential drug compounds, we may not be able to receive regulatory approval, or if approved, we may not be able to generate significant revenues or successfully commercialize our products, which will adversely affect our financial results and financial condition and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development plans which may force us to cease operations.\nAll of our potential drug compounds are exclusively focused on SIGMAR1 which has not previously been the subject of any approved drug products and will require extensive additional research and development, including non-clinical testing and clinical trials, as well as regulatory approvals, before we can market them. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous non-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. We cannot predict if or when any of the potential drug compounds we intend to develop will be approved for marketing. There are many reasons that we may fail in our efforts to develop our potential drug compounds. These include:\n\u25cf the possibility that non-clinical testing or clinical trials may show that our potential drug compounds are ineffective and/or cause harmful side effects;\n\u25cf regulators may not authorize us to commence or continue a clinical trial or may impose a clinical hold or may limit the conduct of a clinical trial through the imposition of a partial clinical hold;\n\u25cf the number of patients required for clinical trials for our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate or the duration of these clinical trials may be longer than we anticipate;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors, including investigators, may fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or may fail to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf our potential drug compounds may prove to be too expensive to manufacture or administer to patients;\n\u25cf our potential drug compounds may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration or foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf even if our potential drug compounds are approved, we may not be able to produce them in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs;\n\u25cf even if our potential drug compounds are approved, they may not achieve commercial acceptance;\n\u25cf regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to any of our potential drug compounds, which could adversely affect their commercial success; and\n\u25cf the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our potential collaborative partners from marketing our potential drug compounds.\nIf we fail to develop our potential drug compounds, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected, we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development plans and may be forced to cease operations.\nOur research and development plans will require substantial additional future funding which could impact our operations and financial condition.\nIt will take several years before we can develop potentially marketable products, if at all. Our research and development plans will require substantial additional capital, arising from costs to:\n\u25cf conduct research, non-clinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities; and\n\u25cf establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, finance and administrative capabilities to support these programs.\nOur future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs;\n\u25cf the scope and results of pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf the time and costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, securing, maintaining and enforcing patents;\n\u25cf competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf our ability to establish additional collaborations;\n\u25cf changes in our existing collaborations;\n\u25cf the cost of manufacturing scale -up; and\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our commercialization activities.\nWe base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables. Such uncertainties include the success of our research initiatives, regulatory approvals, the timing of events outside our direct control such as negotiations with potential strategic partners and other factors. Any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements as they determine such one-time events as the receipt or payment of major milestones and other payments.\nAdditional funds may be required to support our operations and if we are unable to obtain them on favorable terms, we may be required to cease or reduce certain further research and development programs of our drug product platform, sell some or all our intellectual property, merge with another entity or scale back operations.\nIf we or any companion diagnostic collaborator of ours are unable to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostic tests for our drug candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the commercial potential of our drug candidates.\nWe analyze genomic data from clinical trials to identify biomarkers, which we use in the analysis of our clinical trials.\nIdentification of these patients will require the use and development of companion diagnostics. According to the FDAs 2014 guidance document on In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic.\nWe do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics. It may be necessary to resolve issues such as selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of companion diagnostics during the development and regulatory approval processes. Moreover, even if data from preclinical studies and early clinical trials appear to support development of a companion diagnostic for a drug candidate, data generated in later clinical trials may fail to support the analytical and clinical validation of the companion diagnostic. We and our future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and commercializing companion diagnostics similar to those we face with respect to our drug candidates, including issues with achieving regulatory clearance or approval, production of sufficient quantities at commercial scale and with appropriate quality standards, and in gaining market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our drug candidates, or experience delays in doing so, the development of these drug candidates may be adversely affected, these drug candidates may not obtain marketing approval, and we may not realize the full commercial potential of any of these therapeutics that have or may obtain marketing approval. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to develop and obtain regulatory approval for of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our therapeutic candidates or therapeutics.\nCompanion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and will likely require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. If we or third parties are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our drug candidates, or experience delays in doing so:\n\u25cf the development of these drug candidates may be delayed because it may be difficult to identify patients for enrollment in our clinical trials in a timely manner;\n\u25cf these drug candidates may not receive marketing approval if their safe and effective use depends on a companion diagnostic; and\n\u25cf we may not realize the full commercial potential of these drug candidates that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately identify patients or types of tumors targeted by these drug candidates.\nEven if our drug candidates and any associated companion diagnostics are approved for marketing, the need for companion diagnostics may slow or limit adoption of our drug candidates. Our drug candidates may be perceived negatively compared to alternative treatments that do not require the use of companion diagnostics, either due to the additional cost of the companion diagnostic or the need to complete additional prior to administering our drug candidates.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business and growth prospects would be harmed materially.\nAll but one of our clinical trials to date have been conducted outside the United States, and the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.\nThe acceptance of study data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States by the FDA may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for regulatory approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to good clinical practice regulations; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Many foreign regulatory bodies have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA or any other foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States or the applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan, and which may result in our product candidates not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nWe have received Fast Track designation for one of our compounds and may seek such designation or breakthrough therapy and priority review for other compounds in the future. Fast Track designation or breakthrough therapy designation may not actually lead to a faster FDA review and approval process.\nFor some of our compounds, including ANAVEX\u00ae2-73, we hope to benefit from the FDAs fast track and priority review programs. In February 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 clinical development program for the treatment of Rett syndrome. Programs with Fast Track designation may benefit from early and frequent communications with the FDA, potential priority review and the ability to submit a rolling application for regulatory review. Fast Track designation applies to both the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. If any of our compounds receive Fast Track designation but do not continue to meet the criteria for Fast Track designation, or if our clinical trials are delayed, suspended or terminated, or put on clinical hold due to unexpected adverse events or issues with clinical supply, we will not receive the benefits associated with the Fast Track program. Furthermore, Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval. The receipt of Fast Track designation for a compound may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if any product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDAs priority review procedures.\nUnder FDA policies, a compound is eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month time frame from the time a complete NDA is accepted for filing, if the compound provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. The FDA determines whether a drug qualifies for Priority Review after an NDA for such drug is submitted to the FDA. Therefore, until NDAs are submitted for our compounds, we cannot be assured that they will be granted Priority Review. Additionally, even if Priority Review is granted for one of our compounds, the FDA does not always meet its six-month PDUFA goal date for Priority Review and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy designation for one or more of our current or future compounds. Designation as a Breakthrough Therapy is largely within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that a compound meets the criteria for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to candidate products considered for approval under non-expedited FDA review procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more compounds qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification and revoke the designation.\nFast track or breakthrough therapy designation for our compounds may not actually lead to a faster review process, and a delay in the review process or in the approval of our compounds will delay revenue from their potential sales and will increase the capital necessary to fund these compound development programs.\nWe have received orphan drug designation for several of our compounds, but we may be unable to maintain any benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for a disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.\nWe have received orphan drug designation for several of our compounds, but we may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for hose compounds. We may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of any compound for which we have obtained orphan drug designation for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek FDA marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication. Additionally, any compound with orphan drug designation may lose such designation if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, others may obtain orphan drug exclusivity for products addressing the same diseases or conditions as products we are developing, thus limiting our ability to compete in the markets addressing such diseases or conditions for a significant period of time. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process or entitles the product candidate to priority review.\nIf we fail to demonstrate efficacy in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our research and development efforts will be greatly dependent upon our ability to demonstrate potential drug compound efficacy in non-clinical studies, as well as in clinical trials. Non-clinical studies involve testing potential drug compounds in appropriate non-human disease models to demonstrate efficacy and safety. Regulatory agencies evaluate these data carefully before they will approve clinical testing in humans. If certain non-clinical data reveals potential safety issues or the results are inconsistent with an expectation of the potential drug compounds efficacy in humans, the regulatory agencies may require additional more rigorous testing before allowing human clinical trials. This additional testing will increase program expenses and extend timelines. We may decide to suspend further testing on our potential drug compounds if, in the judgment of our management and advisors, the non-clinical test results do not support further development.\nMoreover, success in non-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and non-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our potential drug compounds are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a drug candidate and may delay development of other potential drug compounds. Any delay in, or termination of, our non-clinical testing or clinical trials will delay the filing of an IND and NDA with the FDA or the equivalent applications with pharmaceutical regulatory authorities outside the United States and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our potential drug compounds and generate product revenues. In addition, we expect that our early clinical trials will involve small patient populations. Because of the small sample size, the results of these early clinical trials may not be indicative of future results. Also, the IND process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay the development of our potential drug compounds. Moreover, positive results of non-clinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in subsequent clinical trials.\nFollowing successful non-clinical testing, potential drug compounds will need to be tested in a clinical development program to provide data on safety and efficacy prior to becoming eligible for product approval and licensure by regulatory agencies. From the first human trial through to regulatory approval can take many years and 10-12 years is not unusual for certain compounds.\nIf any of our future clinical development potential drug compounds become the subject of problems, our ability to sustain our development programs will become critically compromised. For example, efficacy or safety concerns may arise, whether or not justified, that could lead to the suspension or termination of our clinical programs. Examples of problems that could arise include, among others:\n\u25cf efficacy or safety concerns with the potential drug compounds, even if not justified;\n\u25cf manufacturing difficulties or concerns;\n\u25cf regulatory proceedings subjecting the potential drug compounds to potential recall;\n\u25cf publicity affecting doctor prescription or patient use of the potential drug compounds;\n\u25cf pressure from competitive products; or\n\u25cf introduction of more effective treatments.\nEach clinical phase is designed to test attributes of the drug and problems that might result in the termination of the entire clinical plan can be revealed at any time throughout the overall clinical program. The failure to demonstrate efficacy in our clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on our future business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not obtain the support of qualified scientific collaborators, our revenue, growth and profitability will likely be limited, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need to establish relationships with leading scientists and research institutions. We believe that such relationships are pivotal to establishing products using our technologies as a standard of care for various indications. Additionally, although in discussion, there is no assurance that our current research partners will continue to work with us or that we will be able to attract additional research partners. If we are not able to establish scientific relationships to assist in our research and development, we may not be able to successfully develop our potential drug compounds. If this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop, market or generate sales of our products to the extent anticipated. Our business may fail and investors could lose all their investment in our Company.\nAssuming that we are successful in developing our potential drug compounds and receiving regulatory clearances to market our products, our ability to successfully penetrate the market and generate sales of those products may be limited by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf If our competitors receive regulatory approvals for and begin marketing similar products in the United States, the European Union, Japan and other territories before we do, greater awareness of their products as compared to ours will cause our competitive position to suffer;\n\u25cf Information from our competitors or the academic community indicating that current products or new products are more effective or offer compelling other benefits than our future products could impede our market penetration or decrease our future market share; and\n\u25cf The pricing and reimbursement environment for our future products, as well as pricing and reimbursement decisions by our competitors and by payers, may have an effect on our revenues.\nIf this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nNone of our potential drug compounds may reach the commercial market for a number of reasons and our business may fail.\nSuccessful research and development of pharmaceutical products is high risk. Most products and development candidates fail to reach the market. Our success depends on the discovery of new drug compounds that we can commercialize. It is possible that our products may never reach the market for a number of reasons. They may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side-effects during non-clinical testing or clinical trials or fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals. We may find that certain products cannot be manufactured at a commercial scale and, therefore, they may not be economical to produce. Our potential products could also fail to achieve market acceptance or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties. Our patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property may be challenged, and this may delay or prohibit us from effectively commercializing our products. Furthermore, we do not expect our potential drug compounds to be commercially available for a number of years, if at all. If none of our potential drug compounds reach the commercial market, our business will likely fail and investors will lose all of their investment in our Company. If this happens, our business will be adversely affected.\nIf our competitors succeed in developing products and technologies faster or that are more effective or with a better profile than our own, or if scientific developments change our understanding of the potential scope and utility of our potential products, then our technologies and future products may be rendered undesirable or obsolete.\nWe face significant competition from industry participants that are pursuing technologies in similar disease states to those that we are pursuing and are developing pharmaceutical products that are competitive with our products. Nearly all of our industry competitors have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staffs and facilities, and a longer history in drug discovery and development, obtaining regulatory approval and pharmaceutical product manufacturing and marketing than we do. With these additional resources, our competitors may be able to respond to the rapid and significant technological changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries faster than we can. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Rapid technological development, as well as new scientific developments, may result in our products becoming obsolete before we can recover any of the expenses incurred to develop them. For example, changes in our understanding of the appropriate population of patients who should be treated with a targeted therapy like we are developing may limit the drugs market potential if it is subsequently demonstrated that only certain subsets of patients should be treated with the targeted therapy.\nWe have advanced our research and development efforts on the treatment of neurodegenerative and central nervous system, or CNS, disorders, a field that has seen very limited success in product development.\nWe have advanced our research and development efforts on addressing neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and CNS disorders. Collectively, efforts by pharmaceutical companies in the field of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and CNS disorders have seen very limited successes in product development. The development of neurodegenerative and CNS therapies presents unique challenges, including an imperfect understanding of the biology, the presence of the blood brain barrier, or BBB, that can restrict the flow of drugs to the brain, a frequent lack of translatability of preclinical study results in subsequent clinical trials and dose selection, and the product candidate having an effect that may be too small to be detected using the outcome measures selected in clinical trials or if the outcomes measured do not reach statistical significance.\nOur reliance on third parties, such as university laboratories, contract manufacturing organizations and contract or clinical research organizations, may result in delays in completing, or a failure to complete, non-clinical testing or clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them or non-compliance with regulations.\nIn the course of product development, we may engage university laboratories, other biotechnology companies or contract or clinical manufacturing organizations to manufacture drug material for us to be used in non-clinical and clinical testing and contract research organizations to conduct and manage non-clinical studies and clinical trials. If we engage these organizations to help us with our non-clinical and clinical programs, many important aspects of this process have been and will be out of our direct control. If any of these organizations we may engage in the future fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform non-clinical testing and/or clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, we may face delays in completing our clinical trials, as well as commercialization of any of our potential drug compounds. Furthermore, any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials, regulatory filings and the potential market approval of our potential drug compounds.\nIn addition, any of these third parties may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of any regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to partnering, licensing, mergers, acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to research and develop our potential drug compounds.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies or organizations for partnering, licensing, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations. Collaborations include contracting with academic research institutions for the performance of specific scientific testing. If our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities. Since each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Other companies have already begun many drug development programs, which may target diseases that we are also targeting, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patent applications and patents that we may need for the development of our potential drug compounds. In some instances, we will attempt to license this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products.\nThe use of any of our products in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims, which may cost us significant amounts of money to defend against or pay out, causing our business to suffer.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products. We currently have one drug compound in clinical trials, however, when any of our products enter clinical trials or become marketed products, they could potentially harm people or allegedly harm people possibly subjecting us to costly and damaging product liability claims. Some of the patients who participate in clinical trials are already ill when they enter a trial or may intentionally or unintentionally fail to meet the exclusion criteria. The waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation. Although we intend to obtain product liability insurance, which we believe is adequate, we are subject to the risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims. The insurance costs along with the defense or payment of liabilities above the amount of coverage could cost us significant amounts of money and management distraction from other elements of the business, causing our business to suffer.\nIf we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information through our information systems. Although we endeavor to protect confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our business and employees. Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures and organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for one or more compounds, we will be subject to continuing regulatory obligations and ongoing regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our compounds, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions on marketing or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our compounds, when and if any of them are approved.\nFollowing potential approval of any our compounds, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on a drugs indicated uses or marketing or require potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug. The FDA may also require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) as a condition of approval of one or more of our compounds, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use of the drug. Additional REMS elements may include restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.\nIn addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves one or more of our compounds, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for the approved drug will be subject to additional and potentially extensive ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf fines, restitutions, disgorgement of profits or revenues, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use, or requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may limit our ability to commercialize our compounds and generate revenue, and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response or generate negative publicity.\nIf any of our compounds are approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion will also be subject to regulatory requirements and ongoing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about drug products. In particular, a drug may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the drugs approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a compound, physicians may nevertheless lawfully prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. While the FDA recently clarified that mere knowledge that a physician is prescribing an approved drug for off label use is not sufficient to constitute unlawful off-label promotion, if we are found to have actively promoted such off label uses, we may become subject to significant liability under the FDCA. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. Additionally, promotion for off label uses could result in significant liability under the False Claims Act. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nThe FDAs and other regulatory authorities policies are subject to change at any time, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our compounds. If we are unable to timely adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance post-marketing, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nFinally, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. It is difficult to predict how any such legislative, administrative or executive actions will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDAs ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these legislative or executive actions impose constraints on the FDAs ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus could adversely impact our business, including our clinical trials, and financial condition.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, the COVID-19 coronavirus has spread to multiple countries, including the United States, Australia and European and Asia-Pacific countries, including countries in which we have planned or active clinical trial sites. As the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, we may experience disruptions that could potentially impact our business and clinical trials.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 coronavirus may impact our future business operations, including our clinical trials, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. Moreover, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section.\nWe receive Australian government research and development income tax incentive refunds. If our research and development expenditures are not deemed to be eligible for the refund, proposed modifications to the tax incentive program are enacted, or the tax incentive program is discontinued by the Australian government, it could have a negative effect on our future cash flows and the funding of future research and development projects.\nOur subsidiary, Anavex Australia Pty Ltd., is incorporated in Australia where we are currently engaged in research and development activities for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 and ANAVEX\u00ae3-71. Our subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Australian Federal Governments Research and Development Tax Incentive program, under which the government provides a cash refund for a portion of eligible research and development expenditures (currently 43.5% to 48.5% depending on the entitys corporate tax rate) by small Australian entities, which are defined as Australian entities with less than $20 million (Australian) in revenue.\nThe Research and Development Tax Incentive refund is offered by the Australian federal government for eligible research and development purposes based on the filing of an annual application. As part of this program, our subsidiary applied for and received cash refunds from the Australian Taxation Office, or the ATO, for a percentage of the research and development costs expended by our subsidiary in Australia. Since the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, we have been receiving Research and Development Tax Incentive refunds related to research and development expenditures made.\nCertain research and development expenses incurred outside of Australia are also eligible for the Australian research and development tax incentive program, provided we obtain an Advance Overseas Finding from AusIndustry, a division of the Australian Governments Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (AusIndustry). To receive an Advance Overseas Finding, the expenses must have been for eligible research and development activities, as determined by AusIndustry, and the expenditures must have a scientific link to the Australian activities, be unable to be conducted in Australia and the total actual and reasonably anticipated overseas costs must be expected to be less than the total actual and reasonably anticipated expenditures for activities conducted within Australia, as determined by AusIndustry at the time of application for an Advance Overseas Finding (OSF).\nThis OSF binds both AusIndustry and the Commissioner of Taxation for three income years. However, for compliance purposes, specific issue guidance jointly issued by AusIndustry and the ATO in 2014 provides that an OSF can apply for the duration of the overseas activity provided the activities are not new or materially different then the activities described in the OSF. Currently, the Company is outside of the binding three-year period with respect to OSF applicable to some of its programs being claimed in Australia.\nTo the extent that some or all of our research and development expenditures are deemed to be ineligible, then our refunds may decrease or be eliminated. In addition, the Australian government may in the future modify the requirements of, reduce the amounts of the refunds available under, or discontinue the Research and Development Tax Incentive program. Any such change to our anticipated refunds or change to the Research and Development Tax Incentive program would have a negative effect on our future cash flows.\nA variety of risks are associated with operating our business internationally which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are presently conducting clinical development solely in Australia, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany and Canada and may choose to conduct additional international and U.S. clinical trials in the future. Additionally, while we have not taken any steps to enter into any non-U.S. markets, we may do so in the future. Accordingly, we are subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u25cf different standards of care in various countries that could complicate the evaluation of our product candidates;\n\u25cf different United States and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;\n\u25cf foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u25cf different payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u25cf potential liability resulting from development work conducted by foreign partners;\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from natural disasters, outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, or geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or systems failure including cybersecurity breaches; and\n\u25cf compliance with evolving and expansive foreign regulatory requirements, including data privacy laws (such as the GDPR).\nAdditionally, in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. government and European Union countries have imposed enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. The U.S. government has also indicated it will consider imposing additional sanctions and other similar measures in the near future. Although we do not currently conduct any clinical trials in Russia or Ukraine, further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business or conduct certain research and development operations, which could adversely affect our business, our supply chain for our product candidates, our collaborators or our ability to carry out our clinical trials.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $123.4 million of U.S. federal and $199.0 million of state and local NOL carryforwards. We had approximately $10.6 million of NOL carryforwards in Australia as of the same period. Our NOL carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the U.S. and state tax authorities. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporations ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and research and development credits to offset its post-change income may be limited. This could limit the amount of NOLs or research and development credit carryforwards that we can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. Subsequent ownership changes and changes to the U.S. tax rules in respect of the utilization of NOLs and research and development credits carried forward may further affect the limitation in future years. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe conducted a Section 382 study during the year ended September 30, 2021 and determined that, during the year ended September 30, 2015, there was a change in ownership which resulted in $25.8 million of federal NOLs being subject to an annual limitation. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we reduced our federal NOLs by $12.1 million and our research and development tax credit carryforwards by $0.8 million, which are the amount of tax assets that will expire unutilized pursuant to the Section 382 study. This resulted in a reduction of $2.5 million of NOLs and $0.8 million of research and development credits and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance of $3.3 million, which was recorded in the 2021 fiscal year. Subsequent ownership changes in future years could trigger additional limitations of our NOLs. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we determined that there were no changes in ownership pursuant to Section 382.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws and regulations which may require substantial compliance efforts and could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil and administrative penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings, among other penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our products, if approved. Our arrangements with such persons and third-party payors and our general business operations will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our drugs, if we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable U.S. federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, including any kickback, bribe or rebate, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or lease, order or recommendation of, any item, good, facility or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including those from civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u25cf The Stark Law prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services payable by Medicare to an entity in which the physician or an immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement, unless a statutory exception applies. There are a number of exceptions to the Stark Law. Such exceptions permit certain payments and arrangements that, although they would otherwise potentially implicate the Stark Law, are not treated as a violation under the same if the requirements of the specific exceptions are met.\n\u25cf HIPAA, which among other things, created additional federal criminal statutes that impose criminal and civil liability for, such actions as executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willingly falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf The privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, which impose certain requirements on covered entities and their business associates, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf U.S. federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act that require applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and annually report to CMS payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, certain other healthcare providers (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners),and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf analogous state or foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state marketing and/or transparency laws applicable to manufacturers that may be broader in scope than the federal requirements, state laws that require biopharmaceutical companies to comply with the biopharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect as HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will likely be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. We may incur significant costs achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our attention from the operation of our business.\nWe expect current and future legislation affecting the pharmaceutical industry, including drug pricing reform, to impact our business generally, which could adversely affect our business operations.\nIn the United States, there have been, and continue to be proposed and enacted legislation at the federal and state levels designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, Promoting Competition in the American Economy, with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Bidens executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. If any of our products are subject to such negotiation, we may lose a significant amount of the revenues expected during the full life cycle of these products. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nThe coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any compound for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic compounds can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.\nThe process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.\nThird-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our compounds to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, we or our collaborators may develop companion diagnostic tests for use with our product candidates. Companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for the product candidates, and for us or our collaborators to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for related companion diagnostic tests that may be developed, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our operations and would severely dilute existing or future investors if we were to raise funds at lower prices.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because our operations have been financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our continued operations. Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future would force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and would have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. If our stock price declines, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. We believe the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate widely and could cause our common stock to trade at a price below the price at which you purchase your shares of common stock:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of new services, products, acquisitions or strategic relationships by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in accounting treatments or principles;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and in analyst recommendations; and\n\u25cf general political, economic, regulatory and market conditions.\nThe market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders and may cause the share price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have 200,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and we also have 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred and common stock up to the authorized capital stated in the articles of incorporation. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all such shares of common stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares of common stock will result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares of common stock, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation. In the event we do issue or sell additional shares of common or preferred stock, it may result in stockholder dilution and may cause our share price to fall.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may be volatile in the future.\nOur stock price has been volatile at certain times historically, and may be volatile in the future. We may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are do not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by us. The stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf announcements of new data, clinical trial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf announcements related to any delays in any preclinical or clinical trials related to our products;\n\u25cf announcements related to our products ability to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile of our product candidates or similar announcements by companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u25cf news that the number of patients required for clinical trials for our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate or the duration of these clinical trials may be longer than we anticipate;\n\u25cf actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates or the progress of our clinical trials, including with respect to any fast track or orphan drug designations;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us, our strategic collaboration partners or our competitors;\n\u25cf grants awarded to us or companies that are perceived to be similar to us from outside entities;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf developments concerning our collaborations or partners;\n\u25cf the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its effect on us;\n\u25cf the perception of the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf declines in the market prices of stocks generally or of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; and\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Capital Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices.\nOur common stock may become the target of a short squeeze.\nSecurities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a short squeeze. These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. There can be no assurance that we will not, in the future be, a target of a short squeeze, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. For example, our directors or executive officers could inadvertently fail to disclose a new relationship or arrangement causing us to fail to make a required related party transaction disclosure. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates that we may pursue may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our intellectual property, particularly patents, in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates and technology. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates or by in-licensing intellectual property. U.S. patents related to ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 are directed to a dosage form comprising certain doses of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 and donepezil, and the coverage is limited to the United States only. We may not be able to obtain patent protection for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 as a single drug or in other jurisdictions.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal, technological and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive product candidates. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative product candidates in a non-infringing manner.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing on third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe hold ownership or exclusive rights to seventeen U.S. patents, nineteen U.S. patent applications, and various PCT or ex-U.S. patent applications relating to our drug candidates, methods associated therewith, and to our research programs. Neither patents nor patent applications ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including the following:\n1. Competitors may interfere with our patenting process in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that Anavex is not entitled to an issued patent for a variety of legal reasons. Competitors may also claim that we are infringing their patents and restrict our freedom to operate. If a court or, in some circumstances, a board of a national patent authority, agrees, we would lose some or all of our patent protection. As a company, we have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with our patents or patent applications.\n2. Because of the time, money and effort involved in obtaining and enforcing patents, our management may spend less time and resources on developing potential drug compounds than they otherwise would, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs.\n3. Issuance of a patent may not provide significant practical protection. If we receive a patent of narrow scope, then it may be possible for competitors to design products that do not infringe our patent(s).\n4. Anavex is seeking patent protection for a number of indications, combination products and drug regimens. The lack of patent protection in global markets for a specific end product or indication may inhibit our ability to advance our compounds and may make Anavex less attractive to potential partners.\n5. Defending a patent lawsuit takes significant time and can be very expensive.\n6. If a court decides that an Anavex compound, its method of manufacture or use, infringes on the competitors patent, we may have to pay substantial damages for infringement.\n7. A court may prohibit us from making, selling or licensing the potential drug compound unless the patent holder grants a license. A patent holder is not required to grant a license. If a license is available, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents, and the license terms may be unacceptable.\n8. Redesigning our potential drug compounds so that they do not infringe on other patents may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nIt is also unclear whether our trade secrets are adequately protected. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions. These research partners may be unable or unwilling to grant us exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations.\nIf we do not obtain required intellectual property licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling potential drug compounds requiring these rights or licenses. There is also a risk that legal disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or potential drug compounds developed in collaboration with other parties, all with attendant risk, distraction, expense, and lack of predictability.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of product candidates that we identify, one of the U.S. patents covering such product candidate or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nAlso, there are detailed rules and requirements regarding the patents that may be submitted to the FDA for listing in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book. We may be unable to obtain patents covering our product candidates that contain one or more claims that satisfy the requirements for listing in the Orange Book. Even if we submit a patent for listing in the Orange Book, the FDA may decline to list the patent, or a manufacturer of generic drugs may challenge the listing. If one of our product candidates is approved and a patent covering that product candidate is not listed in the Orange Book, a manufacturer of generic drugs would not have to provide advance notice to us of any abbreviated new drug application filed with the FDA to obtain permission to sell a generic version of such product candidate.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to an exclusive license agreement with Life Science Research Israel Ltd., with respect to certain in-licensed intellectual property related to our ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 product candidate, and we may need to obtain additional licenses from others in the future. Our license agreement with Life Science Research Israel Ltd. imposes, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various development, diligence, commercialization, and other obligations on us. In spite of our efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 or other product candidates covered by any such future licenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u25cf our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we do not obtain required intellectual property licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or selling potential drug compounds requiring these rights or licenses. There is also a risk that legal disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or potential drug compounds developed in collaboration with other parties, all with attendant risk, distraction, expense, and lack of predictability.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success will also depend in part on our ability to commercialize our compounds without infringing the proprietary rights of others. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. We have not conducted extensive freedom of use patent searches and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could be issued which would have an adverse effect on our ability to market our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our technology. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If our compounds or other subject matter are claimed under other United States patents or other international patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology. There can be no assurances that we would be successful in a challenge or be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to succeed in a challenge, develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain needed licenses could be materially adverse. Adverse consequences include delays in marketing some or all of our potential drug compounds based on our drug technology or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of potential drug compounds requiring such licenses. If we defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease the research and development of our technology.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 or our other product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Additionally, parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nWhile we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any of our employees former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nAlthough we are not currently involved in any litigation, we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and could harm our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Although we are not currently involved in any litigation, if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 or our other product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Our defense of litigation or interference or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 or our other product candidates to market.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensors ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of our patents and patent applications in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensors patents or patent applications. The America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nThe risk factors disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described herein are not the only risks we face. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe do not own any real property. We maintain a corporate head office at 630 5th Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, NY, USA. Our lease costs for this office are approximately $9,500 per month. We believe our offices are suitable and adequate to operate our business currently, as they provide us with sufficient space to conduct our operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe know of no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which our Company or our subsidiary is a party or of which any of their property is subject. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder holding more than 5% of our shares, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our or our subsidiarys interest. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket information\nOur common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market (Nasdaq) under the symbol AVXL.\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of November 28, 2022, there were approximately 49 stockholders of record, and 77,961,815 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. Most of our stockholders hold their shares in street name.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and have no intention of paying any dividends on the shares of our common stock. Our current policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our operations and in the development of our business. Our future dividend policy will be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nSince the beginning of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we have not sold any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 that were not previously reported in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or in a current report on Form 8-K.\nRepurchases of Equity Securities by Our Company and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone. ITEM 6 [Reserved] ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Past operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties. See Forward Looking Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThis section discusses year over year comparisons for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Discussion of year over year comparisons between the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 have been excluded from this Form 10-K and can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nOverview\nWe are in the development stage and have not earned any revenues since our inception in 2004. We do not anticipate earning any revenues until we can establish an alliance with other companies to develop, co-develop, license, acquire or market our products.\nOur operating costs consist primarily of research and development activities including the cost of clinical trials and clinical supplies as well as clinical drug manufacturing and formulation. Research and development expenses also include personnel related costs such as salaries and wages, and third-party contract research organization (CRO) expenses in support of these clinical trials. Personnel costs include salaries and wages, benefits, and non-cash stock-based compensation charges associated with options and other equity awards granted to employees and consultants who are directly engaged in support of our research and development activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and expenses associated with operating as a public company. Personnel costs consist of salaries and wages, benefits and stock-based compensation for general and administrative personnel. Outside professional services and public company expenses, include expenses related to compliance and reporting, additional insurance expenses, audit and SOX compliance, expenses associated with patent research, applications and filings, investor and stockholder relations activities and other administrative expenses and professional services.\nYear ended September 30, 2022\nDuring fiscal 2022, we advanced our business and clinical trials through the following events:\n\u25cf In January 2022, we reported positive top-line results from the placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial (ANAVEX\u00ae3-71-001) in development for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), for which ANAVEX\u00ae3-71 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. The trial achieved primary and secondary safety endpoints.\n\u25cf In February 2022, we reported positive top-line results from the second randomized, placebo-controlled AVATAR Phase 3 clinical trial (ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-RS-002) for the treatment of adult patients with Rett syndrome. The trial met its primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints, with consistent and clinically meaningful improvements in all efficacy measures.\n\u25cf In April 2022, we completed the last patient visit in the 48-week open label extension of the Parkinsons Disease Dementia Phase 2 clinical trial.\n\u25cf In June 2022, the last patient last visit in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 clinical trial ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-AD-004 for the treatment of early Alzheimers disease occurred. We expect to present top line data at the upcoming Clinical Trial on Alzheimers Disease (CTAD) Congress 2022 in San Francisco, CA.\n\u25cf Throughout fiscal 2022, we made significant progress in the randomized, placebo-controlled EXCELLENCE Phase 2/3 clinical trial ANAVEX\u00ae2-73-RS-003 for the treatment of pediatric patients with Rett syndrome with expansion of enrollment into clinical sites across Canada and the United Kingdom.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses for fiscal 2022 increased to $51.0 million, from $42.0 million in fiscal 2021. The increase is attributable to an increase in research and development expenses of $4.9 million in 2022 to $37.9 million, as described below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands):\nCosts of external service providers\n$ 18,102\n$ 21,243\nPersonnel costs\n8,012\n6,987\nStock-based compensation\n11,250\n4,660\nLicense fees\n-\nOther common costs\nTotal research and development costs\n$ 37,916\n$ 32,984\nDuring fiscal 2022, external service providers costs by product candidate were as follows (in thousands):\nANAVEX\u00ae2-73 $ 15,510\nANAVEX\u00ae3-71 2,251\nAll other product candidates\nOther external service provider costs\nTotal external service provider costs $ 18,102\nThe decrease in external service provider costs from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 is related to a decrease in clinical trial expenditures over the comparable period, associated with the completion of the enrollment and recruitment activities for our Phase 2b/3 trial in Alzheimers disease, and manufacturing activities in the comparable period associated with the Rett syndrome program. This decrease was offset by an increase in personnel costs and non-cash stock-based compensation associated with an expanding team directly engaged in support of ongoing research and development activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 increased to $13.1 million, from $9.0 million in fiscal 2021, most significantly related to an increase in personnel and an increase in associated non-cash stock option compensation charges.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we utilized cash and cash equivalents of $24.2 million to fund our operations, compared to $30.4 million during fiscal 2021. Our cash position decreased to $149.2 million at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $2.9 million over the prior year. Cash for operations was generated through the issuance of shares of common stock under the financing arrangements described below.\nWe will continue to see an increase in our research and development expenditures as we advance our ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 clinical trials, including planned advancement of ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 for Parkinsons disease program, planned initiation of a Fragile X clinical program, ongoing extension studies of our current clinical programs, continued advancement of our other pipeline compounds such as ANAVEX\u00ae3-71, and as we continue to add additional staffing to manage and support these clinical initiatives.\nOther income\nNet other income for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $3.4 million as compared to $4.4 million for fiscal 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in other income was due to a decrease in research and development incentive income and an increased foreign exchange loss associated with incentive and other receivables denominated in Australian dollars, and related impact from the fluctuation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar during the year. The decrease was offset by an increase in interest income.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we recorded $3.3 million in research and development incentive income, consisting of the Australian research and development incentive credit administered through the Australian Tax Office, in connection with fiscal 2022 eligible expenditures. In comparison, research and development incentive income for fiscal 2021 was $4.5 million in connection with fiscal 2021 eligible expenditures and fiscal 2020 expenditures for which an overseas finding ruling was obtained during fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to receive support from the Australian government for various clinical trials being conducted within Australia.\nNet loss\nNet loss for fiscal 2022 was $48.0 million, or $0.62 per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $37.9 million, or $0.54 per share for fiscal 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nCurrent Assets\n$ 152,704,603\n$ 161,616,490\nCurrent Liabilities\n10,213,561\n10,798,386\nWorking Capital\n$ 142,491,042\n$ 150,818,104\nAt September 30, 2022, we had $149.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $2.9 million, from $152.1 million at September 30, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year is a result of cash utilized in operations, partially offset by cash provided by financing activities, as described below.\nWe intend to continue to use our capital resources to advance our clinical trials for ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 and ANAVEX\u00ae3-71, and to perform work necessary to prepare for future development of our pipeline compounds.\nCash Flows\nCash flows used in operating activities $ (24,237,864 ) $ (30,383,674 )\nCash flows provided by financing activities 21,287,980 153,242,401\nIncrease (decrease) in cash $ (2,949,884 ) $ 122,858,727\nCash flow used in operating activities\nThere was a decrease in cash used in operating activities of $6.1 million during fiscal 2022 primarily due to the collection of incentive and tax receivables.\nCash flow provided by financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2022 was $21.3 million, net of financing costs, primarily attributable to cash received from the issuance of common shares at various market prices under the Sales Agreement.\nCash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 was $153.2 million, net of financing costs, primarily attributable to cash received from the issuance of common shares at various market prices under the 2019 Purchase Agreement, the Sales Agreement and a direct registered offering.\nOther Financings\nPurchase Agreement\nOn June 7, 2019, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the 2019 Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park), as amended on July 1, 2020, pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock. Concurrently with the execution of the 2019 Purchase Agreement in 2019, we issued 324,383 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as a fee for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the 2019 Purchase Agreement and became obligated to issue up to 162,191 shares pro rata, when and if Lincoln Park purchased, at our discretion, the $50.0 million aggregate commitment.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company issued to Lincoln Park an aggregate of 4,086,209 shares of common stock under the 2019 Purchase Agreement, including 4,007,996 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $24.1 million and 78,213 commitment shares. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, no shares of our common stock remain available for purchase by Lincoln Park under the 2019 Purchase Agreement.\nControlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement\nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into an Amended and Restated Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and SVB Leerink LLC (the Sales Agents), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of common stock registered under an effective registration statement from time to time through the Sales Agents (the At-the-Market Offering).\nUpon delivery of a placement notice based on our instructions and subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, the Sales Agents may sell shares of common stock by methods deemed to be an at the market offering, in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at prices related to such prevailing market prices, or by any other method permitted by law, including negotiated transactions, subject to our prior written consent. We are not obligated to make any sales of shares under the Sales Agreement. We or the Sales Agents may suspend or terminate the At-the-Market Offering upon notice to the other party, subject to certain conditions. The Sales Agents will act as agents on a commercially reasonable efforts basis consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal law, and rules and regulations and the rules of Nasdaq.\nWe have agreed to pay the Sales Agents commissions for their services of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. We have also agreed to provide the Sales Agents with customary indemnification and contribution rights.\nDuring fiscal 2022, 1,623,813 shares were sold pursuant to the At-the-Market Offering for gross proceeds of $21.0 million (net proceeds of $20.3 million after deducting offering expenses).\nDuring fiscal 2021, 5,634,576 shares were sold pursuant to the At-the-Market Offering for gross proceeds of $79.1 million (net proceeds of $76.7 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses).\nRegistered Direct Offering\nOn June 24, 2021, the Company completed a registered direct offering off of the Companys shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on July 3, 2019. The Company issued 2,380,953 common shares at $21.00 per share for gross proceeds of $50.0 million (net proceeds of $46.9 million after deducting offering fees and expenses).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.\nWe base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances, politics, global economics, general business conditions and other factors. Our significant estimates are related to the valuation of warrants and options.\nThere are accounting policies that we believe are significant to the presentation of our financial statements. The most significant of these accounting policies relates to the accounting for our research and development expenses and stock-based compensation expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses are comprised of the costs of the Companys proprietary research and development efforts, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing costs, employee salaries and benefits and stock based compensation expense, contract services including external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties such as contract research organizations (CROs), facilities costs, overhead costs and other related expenses. Milestone payments made by the Company to third parties are expensed when the specific milestone has been achieved. Manufacturing costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 730, Research and Development, as these materials have no alternative future use outside of their intended use.\nNonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and amortized over the period that the goods are delivered, or the related services are performed, subject to an assessment of recoverability. The Company makes estimates of costs incurred in relation to external CROs, and clinical site costs. The Company analyzes the progress of clinical trials, including levels of patient enrollment, invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the amount expensed and the related prepaid asset and accrued liability. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance and expense in any accounting period. The Company reviews and accrues CRO expenses and clinical trial study expenses based on work performed and relies upon estimates of those costs applicable to the stage of completion of a study. Accrued CRO costs are subject to revisions as such trials progress to completion. Revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. With respect to clinical site costs, the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract. Payments under these contracts may be uneven and depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful recruitment of patients, the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions. The objective of our policy is to record expenses in our financial statements based on actual services received and efforts expended. As such, expense accruals related to clinical site costs are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical trial contract.\nIn addition, we incur expenses in respect of the acquisition of intellectual property relating to patents and trademarks. The probability of success and length of time to develop commercial applications of the drugs subject to the acquired patents and trademarks is difficult to determine and numerous risks and uncertainties exist with respect to the timely completion of the development projects. There is no assurance the acquired patents and trademarks will ever be successfully commercialized. Due to these risks and uncertainties, we expense the acquisition of patents and trademarks.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for all stock-based payments and awards under the fair value-based method.\nThe fair value of all share purchase options and warrants are expensed over their contractual vesting period, or over the expected performance period for only the portion of awards expected to vest, in the case of milestone-based vesting, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.\nCompensation costs for stock-based payments with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis. Stock based compensation expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures of unvested awards as they occur.\nWe have granted share purchase option awards that vest upon achievement of certain performance criteria, or milestone-based awards. We estimate an implicit service period for achieving performance criteria for each award and recognizes the resulting fair value as expense over the implicit service period when we conclude that achieving the performance criteria is probable. We periodically review and update as appropriate our estimates of implicit service periods and conclusions on achieving the performance criteria. Performance awards vest upon achievement of the performance criteria.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of share purchase options and warrants at the date of the grant. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility, and expected life of each award. These assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions, which are inherently uncertain, and therefore, are subject to managements judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their possible effect on our results, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our excess cash in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and liquidity. To achieve this objective, our investment policy allows for investments in domestic money market certificates, certificates of deposit, money market funds, commercial papers, bonds or commercial papers, and establishes diversification and credit quality requirements and limits investments by maturity and issuer. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the majority of our excess cash was held in a JP Morgan Chase Prime Money Market Fund. The average amount invested at any given time throughout the year ended September 30, 2022 was $132.7 million (high: $133.2 million; low: $132.2 million) and the average rate of return was 0.74%. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have a material impact on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. To date, we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments and as of September 30, 2022 we did not have any allowance for credit losses from our cash and cash equivalents.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe face foreign exchange risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and as a result of the existence of sales and tax incentive receivables denominated in other than U.S. dollars. Due to the uncertain timing of expected payments in foreign currencies, we do not utilize any forward exchange contracts. All foreign transactions settle on the applicable spot exchange basis at the time such payments are made. Volatile market conditions and supply chain shortages may result in significant changes in exchange rates, and in particular a change in foreign currencies values relative to the U.S. dollar may affect our operating expenses as expressed in U.S. dollars. An adverse movement in foreign exchange rates could have a material effect on payments made to foreign suppliers.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, a majority of our expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates applied to foreign currency transactions for the year ended September 30, 2022 would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAt September 30, 2022, we held net assets of $6.4 million (AUD $9.9 million) denominated in Australian dollars. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates at September 30, 2022 would result in a change in reported net assets of +/- $0.6 million.\nInflation Risk\nInflation generally may affect us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during the periods presented. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nANAVEX LIFE SCIENCES CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeptember 30, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Anavex Life Sciences Corp.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nNovember 28, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Anavex Life Sciences Corp.

Statements\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 1\nNote 1 \tBusiness Description and Basis of Presentation\nBusiness\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp. (Anavex or the Company) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics by applying precision medicine to central nervous system (CNS) diseases with high unmet need. Anavex analyzes genomic data from clinical studies to identify biomarkers, which are used to select patients that will receive the therapeutic benefit for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. The Companys lead compound ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 is being developed to treat Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases, including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a rare severe neurological monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2).\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the instructions to Form 10-K and have been prepared under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nLiquidity\nAll of the Companys potential drug compounds are in the clinical development stage and the Company cannot be certain that its research and development efforts will be successful or, if successful, that its potential drug compounds will ever be approved for sale or generate commercial revenues. To date, we have not generated any revenues from our operations. The Company expects the business to continue to experience negative cash flows for the foreseeable future and cannot predict when, if ever, its business might become profitable.\nManagement believes that the current working capital position will be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital requirements beyond the next 12 months after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The process of drug development can be costly, and the timing and outcomes of clinical trials is uncertain. The assumptions upon which the Company has based its estimates are routinely evaluated and may be subject to change. The actual amount of the Companys expenditures will vary depending upon a number of factors including but not limited to the design, timing and duration of future clinical trials, the progress of the Companys research and development programs and the level of financial resources available. The Company has the ability to adjust its operating plan spending levels based on the timing of future clinical trials.\nOther than our rights related to the Sales Agreement (as defined below in Note 5), there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If the Company is not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, it will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of its research and development activities.\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nThe recent global outbreak of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on the Companys result of operations or financial condition for the year ended September 30, 2022. However, the future course of the pandemic could have adverse effects in the U.S and global economies and thus negatively impact our business and financial results.\nNote 2\tSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to accounting for research and development costs, incentive income receivable, valuation and recoverability of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the book values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 2\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Anavex Life Sciences Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Anavex Australia Pty Limited. (Anavex Australia), a company incorporated under the laws of Australia, Anavex Germany GmbH, a company incorporated under the laws of Germany, and Anavex Canada Ltd., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nCash and equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nHighly liquid investments that are considered cash equivalents include money market accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these securities. The Companys investment policy allows for investments in domestic money market certificates, certificates of deposit, money market funds, bonds or commercial papers, and establishes diversification and credit quality requirements and limits investments by maturity and issuer. The Company currently maintains its investments at one large well known financial institution.\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000, under current regulations. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the Companys cash balances were in excess of these federally insured limits. The Company mitigates this risk by maintaining the majority of its cash balances in a large well-known financial institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses are comprised of the costs of the Companys proprietary research and development efforts, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing costs, employee salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation expense, contract services including external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties such as contract research organizations (CROs), facilities costs, overhead costs and other related expenses. Milestone payments made by the Company to third parties are expensed when the specific milestone has been achieved. Manufacturing costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 730, Research and Development, as these materials have no alternative future use outside of their intended use.\nNonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and amortized over the period that the goods are delivered, or the related services are performed, subject to an assessment of recoverability. The Company makes estimates of costs incurred in relation to external CROs, and clinical site costs. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies including the phase or completion of events, invoices received and contracted costs. Judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Companys estimates. The Companys historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from actual costs.\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 3\nIn addition, the Company incurs expenses in respect of intellectual property costs relating to patents and trademarks. The probability of success and length of time to develop commercial applications of the drugs subject to the underlying patent and trademark costs is difficult to determine and numerous risks and uncertainties exist with respect to the timely completion of the development projects. There is no assurance the drugs subject to the underlying patents and trademarks will ever be successfully commercialized.\nDue to these risks and uncertainties, the patent and trademark costs do not meet the definition of an asset and thus are expensed as incurred within general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and Development Incentive Income\nThe Company is eligible to obtain certain research and development tax credits, including the Australian research and development tax incentive credit (the Australia R&D credit) through a program administered through the Australian Tax Office (the ATO) and AusIndustry, a division of the Australian Governments Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (AusIndustry), which provides for a cash refund based on a percentage of eligible research and development activities undertaken in Australia by the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, Anavex Australia. Anavex Australia is also eligible under the Australia R&D credit program to receive the cash refund for certain research and development expenses incurred by Anavex Australia outside of Australia, to the extent such expenses are pre-approved by AusIndustry pursuant to an advanced overseas finding application.\nThe Australia R&D credit program is available to eligible companies with an annual aggregate revenue of less than $20.0 million Australian during the reimbursable period.\nThe tax incentives are available on the basis of specific criteria with which the Company must comply. Although the tax incentive may be administered through the local tax authority, the Company has accounted for the incentives outside of the scope of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), since the incentives are not linked to the Companys taxable income and can be realized regardless of whether the Company has generated taxable income in the respective jurisdictions.\nWith respect to the Australia R&D credit, as there is no authoritative guidance under GAAP for accounting for grants to for-profit business entities, the Company accounts for the grant by analogy to IAS20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance (IAS 20). The Company recognizes the Research and Development Incentive income as it incurs costs eligible for reimbursement under the Australia R&D credit Program when it is reasonably assured that the cash incentive will be received, as evidenced through enrollment in the program and when the applicable conditions under the program have been met. The Company accrues for the amount of cash refund it expects to receive in relation to research and development expenses outside of Australia only to the extent it has received advanced approval from AusIndustry, pursuant to an approved advanced overseas finding application.\nIn addition, Anavex Australia and Anavex Canada incur Goods and Services Tax (GST) on certain services provided by local vendors. As a domestic entity in those jurisdictions, Anavex Australia and Anavex Canada are entitled to a refund of the GST paid. Similarly, Anavex Germany incurs Value Added Tax (VAT) on certain services provided by local vendors, to which it is entitled to a refund of such VAT paid. The Companys estimate of the amount of cash refund it expects to receive related to GST and VAT incurred is included in Incentive and tax receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nBasic income/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income/(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common stockholders by the sum of (1) the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, (2) the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of options and warrants using the treasury stock method and (3) the dilutive effect of other potentially dilutive securities. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, options and warrants are potentially dilutive securities and are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 4\nAs of September 30, 2022, diluted loss per share excludes 13,329,616 potentially dilutive common shares (2021 - diluted loss per share excludes 11,540,903 potentially dilutive common shares; 2020 - diluted loss per share excludes 10,576,266 potentially dilutive common shares) related to outstanding options and warrants, as their effect was anti-dilutive.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe book value of the Companys financial instruments, consisting of cash and equivalents, incentive and tax receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is managements opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of the Company is the US dollar. Monetary items denominated in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and non-monetary items are translated at exchange rates prevailing when the assets were acquired, or obligations incurred. Foreign currency denominated expense items are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Unrealized gains or losses arising from the translations are credited or charged to income in the period in which they occur.\nThe Company has determined that the functional currency of Anavex Australia Pty Limited, Anavex Germany GmbH, and Anavex Canada Ltd. is also the US dollar.\nSegment and Geographic Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business as one operating segment, which is the business of developing novel therapies for the management of CNS diseases.\nGrant Income\nGrant income is recognized at the fair value of the grant when it is received, and all substantive conditions have been satisfied. Grants received from government and other agencies in advance of the specific research and development costs to which they relate are deferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period they are earned and when the related research and development costs are incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740, which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 5\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740 regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company initially recognizes tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Application requires numerous estimates based on available information. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, and its recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. As additional information is obtained, there may be a need to periodically adjust the recognized tax positions and tax benefits. These periodic adjustments may have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2022 the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to current income tax expense on the interest income, net line, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no interest and penalties related to current income tax expense during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for all stock-based payments and awards under the fair value method.\nThe fair value of all share purchase options and warrants are expensed over their contractual vesting period, or over the expected performance period for only the portion of awards expected to vest, in the case of milestone-based vesting, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.\nCompensation costs for stock-based payments with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis. Stock based compensation expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures of unvested awards as they occur.\nThe Company has granted share purchase option awards that vest upon achievement of certain performance criteria, or milestone-based awards. The Company estimates an implicit service period for achieving performance criteria for each award and recognizes the resulting fair value as expense over the implicit service period when it concludes that achieving the performance criteria is probable. The Company periodically reviews and updates as appropriate its estimates of implicit service periods and conclusions on achieving the performance criteria. Performance awards vest upon achievement of the performance criteria.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of share purchase options and warrants at the date of the grant. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility and expected life of each award. The Company uses the U.S. Treasury daily treasury yield curve rates for the expected term of the option as the risk-free rate. The expected term represents the period that options granted are expected to be outstanding using the simplified method. The Companys historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term. Expected volatility is based on the average of the daily share price changes over the expected term. The Company does not estimate forfeitures and elects to record actual forfeitures as they occur. The Company has not paid any dividends on its common stock historically, therefore no assumption of dividend payments is made in the model. These assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions, which are inherently uncertain, and therefore, are subject to managements judgment. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nThe purchase price of options or warrants may be paid in cash or, if approved by the Companys compensation committee in advance, net settled in shares of the Companys common stock. In a net settlement of an option or warrant, the Company does not receive payment of the exercise price from the holder but reduces the number of shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of the stock option or warrant by the smallest number of whole shares that have an aggregate fair market value equal to or over the aggregate exercise price for the option shares covered by the option or warrant exercised. Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants are issued from the Companys treasury.\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 6\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are reported using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 - \tquoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active \t\tmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and\nLevel 3 - \tassets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nEffective October 1, 2021, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASC 740), which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application. There was no material impact on the Companys operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10). ASU 2021-10 increases the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of (1) the types of assistance, (2) an entitys accounting for the assistance, and (3) the effect of the assistance on an entitys financial statements. ASU 2021-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. Upon implementation, the Company may use either a prospective or retrospective method of adoption when adopting the ASU. The adoption of ASU 2021-10 will impact the disclosures related to the research and development incentive income that the Company receives from the ATO for its clinical trials in Australia. The Company currently plans to adopt the provisions of this ASU on October 1, 2022.\nNote 3\tAccrued Liabilities\nThe principal components of accrued liabilities consist of:\nSchedule of components of accrued liabilities\nAccrued clinical site and patient visits costs\n$ 2,031,105\n$ 2,035,800\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n1,297,337\n1,201,903\nFixed contract accruals\n417,414\n649,649\nAll other accrued liabilities\n2,199,097\n1,727,422\nTotal accrued liabilities\n$ 5,944,953\n$ 5,614,774\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 7\nNote 4\tOther Income\nGrant income\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company received $0 (2021: $497,931; 2020: $0) of a $995,862 research grant awarded during the year ended September 30, 2021, by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research. The grant will be used to fund a clinical trial of the Companys lead compound, ANAVEX\u00ae2-73 related to Parkinsons disease.\nThe grant income is being deferred when received and amortized to other income as the related research and development expenditures are incurred. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized $Nil 0 (2021: $54,100; 2020: $Nil 0) of this grant on its statements of operations within grant income.

The Company had approximately $10.6 million (approximately AU$ 14.9 million) (2021: $7.9 million (approximately AU$ 11.2 million)) of net operating loss carryforwards in Australia, which have an indefinite life, available to offset future taxable income in those jurisdictions.\nThe Company evaluates its valuation allowance requirements based on available evidence. When circumstances change, and this causes a change in managements judgment about the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is reflected in current income. Because management of the Company does not currently believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will receive the benefit of these assets, a full valuation allowance has been established at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2022 Page 13\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and local and foreign jurisdictions. The Companys tax returns are subject to tax examinations by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, or examinations by foreign tax authorities until the respective statutes of limitation expire. The Company is subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for all taxation years commencing on or after 2018.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, NOL and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of an over 50% cumulative change in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period, as well as similar state tax provisions.\nThe Company conducted a Section 382 study during the year ended September 30, 2021 and determined that, during the year ended September 30, 2015, there was a change in ownership which resulted in $25.8 million of federal NOLs being subject to an annual limitation of $439,914. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company reduced its federal NOLs by $12.1 million and its Research and Development tax credit carryforwards by $0.8 million, which are the amount of tax assets that will expire unutilized pursuant to the Section 382 study. This resulted in a reduction of $2.5 million of NOLs and $0.8 million of research and development credits and a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance of $3.3 million, which was recorded in the 2021 fiscal year. Subsequent ownership changes in future years could trigger additional limitations of the Companys NOLs. During the year ended September 30, 2022 the Company determined that there were no changes in ownership pursuant to Section 382.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company did not provide any foreign withholding taxes related to its foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings, as such earnings have been retained and are intended to be indefinitely reinvested to fund ongoing operations of the foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these earnings, because such tax, if any, is dependent upon circumstances existing if and when remittance occur.
