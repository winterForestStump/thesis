Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain information contained in this MD&A includes forward-looking statements. Statements which are not historical reflect our current expectations and projections about our future results, performance, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, prospects and opportunities and are based upon information currently available to us and our management and their interpretation of what is believed to be significant factors affecting our existing and proposed business, including many assumptions regarding future events. Actual results, performance, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, prospects and opportunities could differ materially and perhaps substantially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those risks described in detail in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nForward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words may, should, would, will, could, scheduled, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, intend, seek, or project or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology.\nIn light of these risks and uncertainties, and especially given the nature of our existing and proposed business, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will in fact occur. Potential investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason.\nOverview\nWe are a real estate investment and management company focused on acquisition, construction, selling and managing vacation rentals of residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. We seek to create value through the targeting and acquisition, development, and up-cycling, rebranding, and repositioning of currently undervalued operating and shovel ready residential/resort communities in global travel destinations, with the intention to relaunch these assets under the Awaysis brand with the goals of creating a network of residential and resort enclave communities that will optimize both sales and rental revenues, providing attractive returns to owners and exceptional vacation experiences to travelers. At least initially, our target acquisitions are resorts that have not been completed nor have a prior operational history. As such we intend to purchase the real estate and finish the development, then we would sell the finished units and put them in a rental pool.\nThe Company seeks to own and grow a stable, cash generating, diversified portfolio of single-family and luxury resort/residence properties in the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and the United States.\nOur business strategy entails targeting and identifying undervalued assets in emerging markets located in proximity to high demand travel destinations. The Company intends to focus these efforts on shovel-ready properties and/or other assets that we believe can be used to optimize sales and rental revenues. We have currently identified five properties in the country of Belize, all of which are expected to constitute our initial real estate portfolio. To that effect, on June 30, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of certain real estate assets in San Pedro, Belize (the Casamora Awaysis Assets), pursuant to our previously announced series of Agreements of Purchase and Sale, all dated April 15, 2022. The total consideration paid by us for the properties subject to the agreements was at the appraisal value of $11.4 million (excluding transaction costs and fees) and was settled in a combination of a Purchase Money Mortgage of $2.6 million at 0% interest rate, payable on demand, a Purchase Money Mortgage of $280,000 at 0% interest rate that was paid on August 8, 2022 and 56.8 million shares of the Companys common stock based on a per share price equal to the market price on the date of appraisal of $0.150. As the first acquisition by the Company in Belize and an important milestone, the Company expects to rebrand the Casamora Awaysis Asset, so it is easily identifiable as an Awaysis Property and fit perfectly with its strategy of creating a countrywide network of Awaysis residential enclave communities in the country for owners and guests to travel, work and play.\nRevenues\nAs of June 30, 2023 our revenue consists primarily of monthly rental income of villas and commission from the sale of real property.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and other personnel-related expenses, which may include share-based compensation, for employees engaged in sales, marketing and support of our products and services, promotional and public relations expenses and management and administration expenses in support of sales and marketing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, and other personnel-related costs, which include share-based compensation, associated with administrative and support staff, as well as legal and accounting costs, insurance costs, and other administrative fees.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022\nWe commenced activities and started to incur material costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as a result of our change in control transaction in November 2021 and commencement in February 2022 of our business strategy of acquiring, developing, and managing residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. Our business strategy continued throughout the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, showing substantial growth in operating expenses in preparation for expected future growth in revenue.\nWe have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.\nWe expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.\nRevenues\nWe recognized revenue of $107,760 and $-0- during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue generated during fiscal year 2023 consisted of a few months worth of a monthly rental of 2 units and commissions from a property sale. Fiscal year 2022 had no revenue generating activities during this period.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred sales and marketing expenses of $91,319 and $49,269, respectively, consisting of marketing and support of our products and services, promotional and public relations expenses and management and administration expenses in support of sales and marketing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $4,312,499 and $190,582, respectively, consisting of audit and accounting fees, travel and entertainment, payroll and employee benefits, legal fees, filing fees and transfer agent fees, all relating to both sustaining the corporate existence of the Company and public company-related expenses and transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company under its new management.\nOperating Loss\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized operating losses of $(4,296,058) and $(239,851), respectively. These losses were primarily attributable to increased operating expenses related to salaries due to the Company transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company under its new management and brand.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred interest expenses of $612 and $0, respectively, consisting of a gain on foreign exchange transaction and interest earned.\nNet Loss\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net losses of $(4,295,446) and $(239,851), respectively. These losses were primarily attributable to accounting, marketing, legal, filing fees and transfer agent fees to sustaining the corporate existence of the Company and public company related expenses, and transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company under its new management and brand.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had cash of $79 and had a positive working capital of $5,742,463, of which was mainly from the issuance of shares for real estate inventory and sale of shares from our private placement of common stock. We do not have sufficient cash or commitments for funding to satisfy our basic operations for at least 12 months, and expect the anticipated cost of development of our first properties to come from pre-sales, investors subscriptions, advances from its principal shareholders and not cash-on-hand. We will need to raise additional cash to satisfy both our short and long-term requirements.\nHistorically, our principal shareholder has advanced funds on our behalf as we have required for the Company to become, and remain, a fully reporting public company while seeking to create value for shareholders by pursuing our business plan to reinvent the Company as a real estate investment and management company. The shareholder has indicated its intention to continue to do so; provided, however, that such intentions do not represent a binding commitment by the principal shareholder and there is no guarantee that our principal shareholder will be able to provide the funding necessary to achieve this objective. To date, our principal shareholder has advanced an aggregate of approximately $255,000 on behalf of the Company to cover certain of the Companys expenses. Neither the shareholder nor the Company have entered into any agreement with respect to the terms and conditions of such advances, including any repayment terms, although we expect to do so.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional advances from our principal shareholder, we anticipate facing major challenges in raising the necessary funding to affect our business plan. Raising debt or equity funding for small publicly quoted, penny stock companies is extremely challenging. We can provide no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts it needs or on terms acceptable to it, if at all. If we are not able to secure adequate additional working capital when it becomes needed, it may be required to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible and/or suspend or curtail planned acquisitions and developments. Any of these actions could materially harm our planned business.\nOur plan for satisfying our cash requirements and to remain operational for the next 12 months and beyond or to further expand our asset base is through the sale of shares of our capital stock to third parties and advances from our principal shareholder. While we are seeking to raise up to $25 million through the sale of our common stock or through other offerings of securities, we cannot assure you we will be successful in raising any or all of such capital and in meeting our working capital needs. Through June 30, 2023, we have raised an aggregate of $1,918,000 in our recent private placement and can give no assurance that we will be successful in raising the remaining funds being sought. The capital raises from issuances of equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. In addition, to the extent we determine to incur indebtedness, our incurrence of debt could result in debt service obligations and operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nThe following table provides a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the periods set forth below:\nYear ended June 30,\nCash used in operating activities $ (257,255 ) $ (157,645 )\nCash provided by investing activities (29,631 ) (22,145 )\nCash provided by financing activities (195,000 ) 661,755\nChange in cash $ (481,886 ) $ 481,965\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. Net cash flows used in operating activities were $(257,255) and $(157,645) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, net cash flow used for investing activities was $(29,631) and $(22,145), respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2021, we financed our operations primarily by way of advances from notes payable from a former director and former majority shareholder, and in 2022 through June 30, 2023, we have financed our operations by way of advances from our current majority shareholders, issuance of shares and debt for real estate inventory, in addition to cash raised from the private placement offering. The Company offered up to $25 million worth of restricted shares of common stock to a limited number of accredited investors, at a price per share of $1.00.\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, net cash from financing activities was $(195,000) and $661,755, respectively.\nWe are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan to become a real estate investment and management company. In addition, we are dependent upon our controlling shareholder to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe company applies judgment and estimates that may have material effect in the eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, accounts receivable, inventory and goodwill. The following explains the basis and the procedure where judgment and estimates are applied.\nInventories\nNew real estate inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished inventories determined on the specific identification method is removed from inventories and recorded as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized. In addition, an allocation of depreciation and amortization is included in cost of goods sold. Under the specific identification method, if finished real estate inventory can be sold for a profit there is no basis to write down the inventory below the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nGoing Concern\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, we had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2023 and 2022, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting periods then ended. As of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had cash in the amount of $79 and $481,965, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had executed subscriptions pending funding in the amount of $943,000 and $1,193,000, respectively.\nThe Company is commencing operations and seeking to generate sufficient revenue to support its current basic operations for at least the next 12 months; however, the Companys current cash position is not sufficient to support the Companys strategy. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue to further develop its first properties through presales, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to further implement its business plan, generate sufficient revenue through presales or otherwise, and its ability to raise additional funds by way of private offering or debt. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot required. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe consolidated financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K immediately following Part IV and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company needs to implement disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an assessment, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our then existing disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). As of the date of this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, primarily as a result of the Companys recent transitions with respect to its auditor and its CFO. The Companys management is seeking to remedy this deficiency. Additionally, we have implemented a quarterly newsletter to communicate to our Board and investor community.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a - 15(f) of the Exchange Act). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a -15(f) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2023, and have concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during our last fiscal quarter and year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

All company officers have been appointed to serve until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. Information regarding our executive officers is set forth above under Board of Directors.\nName\nAge\nTitles\nMichael Singh\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nDr. Andrew E. Trumbach\nDirector and President and CFO\nLisa-Marie Iannitelli\nExecutive Vice President, Investor Relations and Director\nTyler Trumbach\nChief Legal Counsel and Director\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nStructure and Operation of the Board\nPresently, our Board of Directors maintains a standing Audit Committee that does not yet satisfy Nasdaqs definition of independence. The Company does not have a standing compensation or nominating committee. However, the full Board performs all of the functions of a standing compensation committee and nominating committee. The Board currently consists of six directors: Mr. Singh (Chairman), Dr. Trumbach, Ms. Iannitelli, Dr. Stuart, Dr. Kini and Mr. Trumbach. The following is a brief description of these functions of the Board:\nNomination of Directors\nThe Board does not currently have a standing nominating committee, and thus we do not have a nominating committee charter. Due to our small size and limited operations to date, the Board determined that it was appropriate for the entire Board to act as the nominating committee. The full Board currently has the responsibility of selecting individuals to be nominated for election to the Board. Board candidates are typically identified by existing directors or members of management. The Board will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders. Any such candidates will be evaluated on the same basis as other candidates being evaluated by the Board. Information with respect to such candidates should be sent to Awaysis Capital, Inc., 3400 Lakeview Drive, Suite 100, Miramar, FL 33027; c/o Chairman. The Board considers the needs for the Board as a whole when identifying and evaluating nominees and, among other things, considers diversity in background, age, experience, qualifications, attributes and skills in identifying nominees, although it does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity.\nAudit Committee\nOur recently-formed Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Trumbach, Stuart and Kini. The Board has determined that Messrs. Stuart and Kini are independent, and Mr. Trumbach is an audit committee financial expert as defined in SEC rules, although he is not independent. The Audit Committee has not yet adopted a written charter but expects to do so.\nThe primary functions of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board in overseeing (i) the effectiveness of the Companys accounting and financial reporting processes and internal controls and the audits of the Companys financial statements, (ii) the qualifications, independence, appointment, retention, compensation and performance of the Companys registered public accounting firm, and (iii) the performance of the Companys internal audit department or department or person(s) having the equivalent responsibility and functions.\nBecause the Companys common stock is traded on the OTC Pink market, the Company is not subject to the listing requirements of any securities exchange regarding audit committee related matters.\nRisk Oversight\nThe Boards risk oversight is administered primarily through the following:\n\u25cf review and approval of an annual business plan;\n\u25cf review of a summary of risks and opportunities at meetings of the Board;\n\u25cf review of business developments, business plan implementation and financial results;\n\u25cf oversight of internal controls over financial reporting; and\n\u25cf review of employee compensation and its relationship to our business plans.\nDue to the small size and early stage of the Company, we have not adopted a formal policy on whether there should be a separate Non-Executive Chairman.\nCompensation Committee Related Function\nThe Board does not currently have a standing compensation committee, and thus we do not have a compensation committee charter. Due to our small size and limited operations to date, the Board determined that it was appropriate for the entire Board to act as the compensation committee. The full Board currently has the responsibility for reviewing and establishing compensation for executive officers and making policy decisions concerning salaries and incentive compensation for executive officers of the Company.\nThe Companys executive compensation program is administered by the Board, which determines the compensation of the executive officers of the Company. In reviewing the compensation of the individual executive officers, the Board intends to consider the recommendations of the executive officers, published compensation surveys and current market conditions.\nCommunication with Shareholders\nShareholders wishing to communicate with the Board can send an email to info@awaysiscapital.com or write or telephone to the Companys corporate offices:\nAwaysis Capital, Inc.\nChairman\nLakeview Drive, Suite 100\nMiramar, FL 33027\nTelephone: (855) 795-3311\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nWe adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, our principal executive officers, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCorporate Governance\nSection 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC reports of ownership of our securities and changes in reported ownership. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations from the reporting persons that no Form 5 was required, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, with the exception of one untimely Form 3 for Mr. Amir Vasquez, our former CFO, and one untimely Form 4 for each of Tyler Trumbach and Narendra Kini, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners have been met.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nRelated Person Transaction\nThe Board intends to implement a policy to review, approve and oversee any transaction between us and any related person and any other potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis, and develops policies and procedures for the approval of related party transactions. Prior to consideration of a transaction with a related person, the material facts as to the related persons relationship or interest in the transaction would be disclosed to the disinterested directors. The transaction would not be approved unless a majority of the members of the Board who are not interested in the transaction approve the transaction. The Board intends to take into account, among other factors that it deems appropriate, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available in a transaction with an unrelated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related persons interest in the related person transaction.\nEach of Mr. Singh, Dr. Trumbach and Ms. Iannitelli are Executive Directors of Harthorne, the owner of approximately 38.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, Harthorne advanced $255,489 and $12,497, respectively, relating to costs paid on behalf of the Company.\nTyler Trumbach, a director of the Company and its Chief Legal Officer, performed certain general counsel and legal services for the Company through The Law Offices of Tyler A.

NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Companys Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\u25cf The director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company;\n\u25cf The director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);\n\u25cf A family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company;\n\u25cf The director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);\n\u25cf The director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or\n\u25cf The director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the companys outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the companys outside auditor, and who worked on the companys audit.\nUnder such definitions, two of our directors can be considered independent.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThe financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and for the year then ended were audited by other auditors whose report dated November 4, 2023, on those statements included an explanatory paragraph that described the substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nWe determined that there are no critical audit matters.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2023.\nMoore Belize LLP (PCAOB ID 6999)\nBelize City Belize CA\nOctober 14, 2023\nReynaldo Maga\u00f1a is a licensed practicing member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Belize and a Licensed CPA of the State of Florida and Michigan and is duly authorized to carry out company audit work in Belize and the United States.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nNature of Business\nAwaysis Capital, Inc. (formerly known as JV Group, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, (Awaysis, JV Group, the Company, we, us or our) is a publicly quoted operating company. We are a vacation rental company focused on acquisition, construction, selling and managing rentals of residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. We seek to create value through the targeting and acquisition, development, and up-cycling, rebranding, and repositioning of currently undervalued residential/resort communities in global travel destinations, with the intention to relaunch these assets under the Awaysis brand with the goals of creating a network of residential and resort enclave communities that will optimize revenues, providing attractive returns to investors and exceptional vacation experiences to travelers.\nCompany History\nJV Group was formed in Delaware on September 29, 2008 under the name ASPI, Inc.\nOn May 18, 2022, we changed our name from JV Group, Inc. to Awaysis Capital, Inc. In connection with this name change, we changed our ticker symbol from ASZP to AWCA and effective May 25, 2022, we began trading on the OTC Market under our new symbol.\nIn December 2021, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Awaysis Capital, LLC, a Florida single member limited liability corporation to hold the office lease and to become the master payroll company for Awaysis Capital Inc.\nWe also formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Awaysis Casamora Limited, a Belize single member limited liability corporation to hold the title to the acquisition of the Casamora assets.\nFrom October 2015 to February 2022, we were a publicly quoted shell company seeking to merge with an entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create values for our shareholders. In February 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company determined to pursue a business strategy of acquiring, developing and managing residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations.\nThe Companys principal executive office is located at 3400 Lakeside Drive, Suite 100, Miramar, FL 33027 and its main number is 855-795-3377. The Companys website address is www.awaysisgroup.com.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in the understanding of the consolidated financial statements. These policies conform to GAAP and have been consistently applied. The Company has selected June 30 as its financial year end. The Company did not earn any revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and has earned $107,760 of revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nPrincipals of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include accounts of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries Awaysis Capital, LLC, Awaysis Cove Limited, Awaysis Chial Limited and Awaysis Casamora Limited. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe maintain cash balances in a non-interest-bearing account and unrestricted cash in escrow that currently does not exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2022, our cash balance was $481,965 and as of June 30, 2023 our cash balance was $79. The Company will hold payments made by guest in advance of reservations in a restricted escrow accounts until the rescission period expires in accordance with U.S. state regulations.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\nLevel 3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.\nOur financial accounts consist of prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accounts payable due to related parties and note payable. The carrying amount of our prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accounts payable - related party and note payable - related party approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturities.\nRelated Party Transactions\nA related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of our membership interests including such persons immediate families, (ii) our management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence our financial and operating decisions. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The fixed assets include property, equipment and software which ownership is maintained by the Company.\nLeases\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and all related amendments on January 1, 2022, on a modified retrospective basis. Under Topic 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option and when doing so is at the Companys sole discretion. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception for all classes of assets, and therefore has not applied the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to leases of 12 months or less. The Company has also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. The Companys classes of assets that are leased include real estate leases and equipment leases. Real estate leases typically pertain to the Companys corporate office locations, field operation locations, or vacation properties whereby the Company takes control of a third partys property during the lease period for the purpose of renting the property on a short-term basis.\nThe Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Companys lease agreements may contain variable costs such as common area maintenance, operating expenses or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) as assets, operating lease non-current liabilities, and operating lease current liabilities in our balance sheet. Finance leases are property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet.\nROU assets represent the right to use an asset for the lease term and lease liability represent the obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over lease term. As most of the leases doesnt provide an implicit rate, we generally use the incremental borrowing rate on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over lease term.\nWe were party to an operating lease agreement which commenced during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, We were not party to an operating lease agreement at June 30, 2022. See Note 8 below for details of lessee leases.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Section 740-10-25). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\nManagement makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Recognition Standard, ASC 606 is used by the Company to recognize revenue. ASC 606 standards were jointly issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The total booking value is generally due prior to the commencement of the reservation. The total booking value collected in advance of the reservation is recorded on the balance sheets as funds payable to owners, hospitality and sales taxes payable and deferred revenue in the amount obligated to the homeowner, the taxing authority, and the Company, respectively.\nThe Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company is a development stage corporation. We have identified certain revenue streams during the development stage.\nThe Company currently derives its revenue primarily from the short-term unit rentals of sold and unsold inventory at the resort we own and manage.\nRevenue from rentals is recognized over the period in which a guest completes a stay.\nRevenue recognized from rentals was $72,460 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nOther services consist of revenue derived from our real estate brokerage and other related services.\nRevenue recognized from these other services was $35,300 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nOther Services\nIn addition to providing vacation rental platform services, the Company provides other services including real estate brokerage and management services to the home owners associations. The purpose of these services is to attract and retain homeowners as customers of the Companys vacation rental platform. As such, the Company enters into an exclusive rental management contract with each home owners associations it controls. Under the real estate brokerage services, the Company assists home buyers and sellers in listing, marketing, selling and finding homes. Real estate commissions earned by the Companys real estate brokerage business are recorded as revenue at a point in time which is upon the closing of a real estate transaction (i.e., purchase or sale of a home). The commissions the Company pays to real estate agents are recognized concurrently with associated revenues and presented as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Under the home owners association management services, the Company provides common area property management, community governance, and association accounting services to community and homeowner associations in exchange for a management fee and other incrementally billed services. The services represent an individual performance obligation in which the Company has determined it is primarily responsible. Revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered for the management fee and incrementally billed services are recognized at a point in time.\nInventory\nNew real estate inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished inventories determined on the specific identification method is removed from inventories and recorded as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized. In addition, an allocation of depreciation and amortization is included in cost of goods sold. Under the specific identification method, if finished real estate inventory can be sold for a profit there is no basis to write down the inventory below the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nInventory of real estate under construction was $11,323,226 and $11,409,500 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFinancial Instruments\nFair Value of Financial Instruments - From inception, the Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard also expands disclosures about instruments measured at fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\u25cf Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\n\u25cf Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash, accounts payable, warrant liability and notes payable approximated fair value as of June 30, 2023, and 2022 due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments.\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs\nWe expense advertising costs when advertisements occur. Advertising for the Company consists primarily of the creation and marketing of the Awaysis brand guideline, logo, wordmark, tagline, and website. Advertising expenses amounted to approximately $10,612 and $44,800 as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe cost of equity instruments issued to employees and non-employees in return for goods and services is measured by the grant date fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The related expense is recognized as services are rendered or vesting periods elapse.\nStock-based compensation of $112,557 and $42,736 was issued for services during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in the General and Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Loss per Share Calculation\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nNo potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued or outstanding during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAs of June 30, 2023, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n3. GOING CONCERN\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). The Companys financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2023 and 2022, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting periods then ended. As of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, it has cash in the amount of $79 and $481,965, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has executed subscription to be funded in the amount of $943,000 and $1,193,000, respectively.\nThe Company is commencing operations and seeking to generate sufficient revenue to support its current basic operations for at least the next 12 months; however, the Companys cash position is not sufficient to support the Companys - strategy. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue to further develop its first properties through presales, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to further implement its business plan, generate sufficient revenue through presales or otherwise, and its ability to raise additional funds by way of private offering or debt. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n4.
