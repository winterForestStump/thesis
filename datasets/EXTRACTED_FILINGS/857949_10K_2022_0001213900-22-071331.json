    "content": "Item 1. Business\nChina Green Agriculture, Inc. (\u2018we or the Company) is primarily engaged in the research, development, production, and sale of various types of fertilizers and agricultural products in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) through its wholly owned Chinese subsidiaries, Jinong Shaanxi TechTeam Jinong Humic Acid Product Co., Ltd. (Jinong), and Beijing Gufeng Chemical Products Co., Ltd., (Gufeng), both of which are engaged in fertilizer production. In addition, we operate through variable interest entities (the VIEs), including Xian Hu County Yuxing Agriculture Technology Development Co., Ltd. (Yuxing), engaged in agricultural products production, and Tianjuyuan Fertilizer Co. Ltd. Our primary business is fertilizer products, specifically humic acid-based compound fertilizer produced through Jinong; and compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizers, highly concentrated water-soluble fertilizers, and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer produced through Gufeng. In addition, through Yuxing, we develop and produce agricultural products, such as top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings.\nSince June 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Jinong, entered into strategic acquisition agreements and a series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of the following eight companies that are organized under the laws of the PRC and are deemed as VIEs: Shaanxi Lishijie Agrochemical Co., Ltd., Songyuan Jinyangguang Sannong Service Co., Ltd., Shenqiu County Zhenbai Agriculture Co., Ltd., Weinan City Linwei District Wangtian Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., Aksu Xindeguo Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., and Xinjiang Xinyulei Eco-agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Sunwu County Xiangrong Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., and Anhui Fengnong Seed Co., Ltd.

Our total annual production capacity was 555,000 metric tons as of June 30, 2022.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we sold our products through a network of 1,398 regional distributors covering 22 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 4 central government-controlled municipalities in China. We do not rely on any single distributor. Our top five distributors accounted for approximately 49.9% of our fertilizer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we have developed 416 different fertilizer products. We conduct our research and development activities through Yuxing, one of Jinongs VIEs, which tests new fertilizers and grows high quality flowers, vegetables and seedlings for commercial sales.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our revenues from continuing and discontinued operations were $181,806,425, $239,927,726, and $249,243,496, respectively; our net income (loss) for these periods was $(98,364,332), $(119,747,617), and $(134,689,311), respectively.\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Acquisitions:\nOn June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, through Jinong, we entered (i) Strategic Acquisition Agreements (the SAA), and (ii) Agreements for Convertible Notes (the ACN), with the shareholders of the companies as identified below (the Targets).\nJune 30, 2016:\nCash\nPrincipal of\nPayment for\nNotes for\nAcquisition\nAcquisition\nCompany Name\nBusiness Scope\n(RMB[1])\n(RMB)\nShaanxi Lishijie\nAgrochemical Co., Ltd.\nSales of pesticides, agricultural chemicals, chemical fertilizers, agricultural materials; Manufacture and sales of mulches.\n10,000,000\n3,000,000\nSongyuan\nJinyangguang Sannong Service Co., Ltd.\nPromotion and consulting services regarding agricultural technologies; Retail sales of chemical fertilizers (including compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers); Wholesale and retail sales of pesticides, agricultural machinery and accessories; Collection of agricultural information; Development of saline-alkali soil; Promotion and development of high-efficiency agriculture and related information technology solutions for agriculture, agricultural and biological engineering high technologies; E-commerce; Cultivation of freshwater fish, poultry, fruits, flowers, vegetables, and seeds; Recycling and complex utilization of straw and stalk; Technology transfer and training; Recycling of agricultural materials; Ecological industry planning.\n8,000,000\n12,000,000\nShenqiu County Zhenbai Agriculture Co., Ltd.(2)\nCultivation of crops; Storage, sales, preliminary processing and logistics distribution of agricultural by-products; Promotion and application of agricultural technologies; Purchase and sales of agricultural materials; Electronic commerce.\n3,000,000\n12,000,000\nWeinan City Linwei District Wangtian Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd.\nPromotion and application of new agricultural technologies; Professional prevention of plant diseases and insect pests; Sales of plant protection products, plastic mulches, material, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural medicines, micronutrient fertilizers, hormones, agricultural machinery and medicines, and gardening tools.\n6,000,000\n12,000,000\nAksu Xindeguo Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd.(3)\nWholesale and retail sales of pesticides; Sales of chemical fertilizers, packaged seeds, agricultural mulches, micronutrient fertilizers, compound fertilizers, plant growth regulators, agricultural machinery, and water economizers; Consulting services for agricultural technologies; Purchase and sales of agricultural by- products.\n10,000,000\n12,000,000\nXinjiang Xinyulei Eco-agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd (3)\nSales of chemical fertilizers, packaged seeds, agricultural mulches, micronutrient fertilizers, organic fertilizers, plant growth regulators, agricultural machineries, and water economizers; Purchase and sales of agricultural by-products; Cultivation of fruits and vegetables; Consulting services and training for agricultural technologies; Storage services; Sales of articles of daily use, food and oil; On-line sales of the above-mentioned products.\nTotal\n37,000,000\n51,000,000\n(1) The exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars on June 30, 2016 was RMB1=US$0.1508, according to the exchange rate published by Bank of China.\n(2) On November 30, 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, discontinued the strategic acquisition agreements and the series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of Zhenbai.

In return, the shareholders of Fengnong agreed to pay cash with amount of RMB8,750,000(approximately $1,306,375) to the Company.\nPursuant to the SAA and the ACN, the shareholders of the Targets, while retaining possession of the equity interests and continuing to be the legal owners of such interests, agreed to pledge and entrust all of their equity interests, including the proceeds thereof (but excluding any claims or encumbrances), and the operations and management of its business to Jinong, in exchange for an aggregate amount of RMB45,000,000 (approximately $6,718,500), to be paid by Jinong within three days following the execution of the SAA, ACN and the VIE Agreements, and convertible notes with an aggregate face value of RMB63,000,000 (approximately $9,405,900), with an annual fixed compound interest rate of 3% and a term of three years.\nThe SAA contains representations and warranties by both Jinong and the shareholders of the Targets, including:\nShould the shareholders of the Targets fail to satisfy the conditions listed in the exhibit to the SAA, i.e., the entry into the VIE Agreements, or breach of any the representations or warranties in the SAA, other than the direct and consequential damages that may cause to Jinong, they are to pay RMB100,000 (approximately $14,930) as liquidated damages.\nThe shareholders of the Targets also agreed to ensure that its management and principal technology employees enter into noncompetition agreements prohibiting them from any direct or indirect operation or ownership of any business that is in competition with the Targets.\nThe shareholders of the Targets also represented that there are no claims or encumbrances against their interests, as defined in the SAA, and that there are no actions or other legal proceedings pending against the Targets that would have a material adverse effect on the Targets capacity to fulfill their contractual obligations. The Targets are to have a minimum of 10% annual compound growth rate (the Growth Rate) within the three years after the closing of the acquisitions (the Closing).\nPursuant to the SAA, all the existing employees continue to be the employees of the Targets after the Closing based on their current employment terms, subject to the decisions of the new Boards of Directors of the Targets to be formed after the Closing.\nUnder the agreements relating to the convertible notes, each convertible note has a face value of RMB100, with a term of three years and an annual fixed compound interest rate of 3%. The convertible notes take priority over the preferred stock and common stock of Jinong, and any other class or series of capital stock Jinong issues in the future, in terms of interest and payments in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Jinong. On or after the third anniversary of the issuance date of each note (the Maturity Date), noteholders may convert the notes into Common Stock of the Company. The noteholders may not convert the notes prior to the Maturity Date. If a note is converted into the Companys common stock, the noteholder will become a holder of the Companys common stock.\nThe per share conversion price of the notes is the greater of the following: (i) $5.00 per share or (ii) 75% of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date the noteholder delivers the conversion notice.\nIf the profits of the Targets hit certain levels of sales set by the parties, i.e., the Growth Rate, Jinong may, at its discretion, convert the notes to (i) cash, (ii) the Companys common stock, or (iii) to a combination of cash and the Companys common stock, in the amount of the face value of the notes with compound interest for three years.\nUpon the Maturity Date of the note, the noteholder can (i) request Jinong to convert all or a part of the note; (ii) continue to hold the note until the holder elects to deliver a conversion request; however, if the holder chooses to hold the note after the Maturity Date, no interest accrues on the note after the three-year term.\nIn the event that the actions of the Targets or noteholders materially impair Jinong or if any of the Targets fail to achieve the Growth Rate, Jinong may request noteholders to redeem the shares they hold of the Targets for (i) an amount represented by the convertible notes including the accrued interest and the cash payment Jinong made on the Closing of the acquisition and (ii) 15% of the amount under (i) mentioned immediately prior to this item. However, the noteholder can elect to offset the payment of the interest of the note by the annual increase rate the Targets realizes, despite a lower rate.\nVIE Structure with the Targets\nJinong, the Targets, and the shareholders of the Targets also entered into a series of contractual agreements for the Targets to qualify as variable interest entities or VIEs (the VIE Agreements). The VIE Agreements can be summarized as follows:\nEntrusted Management Agreements\nPursuant to the terms of certain Entrusted Management Agreements dated June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, between Jinong and the shareholders of the sales VIE Companies (the Entrusted Management Agreements), the sales VIE Companies and their shareholders agreed to entrust the operations and management of its business to Jinong. According to the Entrusted Management Agreement, Jinong possesses the full and exclusive right to manage the sales VIE Companies operations, assets and personnel, has the right to control all the sales VIE Companies cash flows through an entrusted bank account, is entitled to the sales VIE Companies net profits as a management fee, is obligated to pay all the sales VIE Companies payables and loan payments, and bears all losses of the sales VIE Companies. The Entrusted Management Agreements will remain in effect until (i) the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement; (ii) the dissolution of the sales VIE Companies; or (iii) Jinong acquires all the assets or equity of the sales VIE Companies (as more fully described below under Exclusive Option Agreements).\nExclusive Technology Supply Agreements\nPursuant to the terms of certain Exclusive Technology Supply Agreements dated June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, between Jinong and the sales VIE companies (the Exclusive Technology Supply Agreements), Jinong is the exclusive technology provider to the sales VIE companies. The sales VIE companies agreed to pay Jinong all fees payable for technology supply prior to making any payments under the Entrusted Management Agreement. The Exclusive Technology Supply Agreements shall remain in effect until (i) the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement; (ii) the dissolution of the sales VIE companies; or (iii) Jinong acquires the sales VIE companies (as more fully described below under Exclusive Option Agreements).\nShareholders Voting Proxy Agreements\nPursuant to the terms of certain Shareholders Voting Proxy Agreements dated June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, among Jinong and the shareholders of the sales VIE companies (the Shareholders Voting Proxy Agreements), the shareholders of the sales VIE companies irrevocably appointed Jinong as their proxy to exercise on such shareholders behalf all of their voting rights as shareholders pursuant to PRC law and the Articles of Association of the sales VIE companies, including the appointment and election of directors of the sales VIE companies. Jinong agreed that it shall maintain a board of directors, the composition and appointment of which shall be approved by the Board of the Company. The Shareholders Voting Proxy Agreements will remain in effect until Jinong acquires all the assets or equity of the sales VIE companies.\nExclusive Option Agreements\nPursuant to the terms of certain Exclusive Option Agreements dated June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, among Jinong, the sales VIE companies, and the shareholders of the sales VIE companies (the Exclusive Option Agreements), the shareholders of the sales VIE companies granted Jinong an irrevocable and exclusive purchase option (the Option) to acquire the sales VIE companies equity interests and/or remaining assets, but only to the extent that the acquisition does not violate limitations imposed by PRC law on such transactions. The Option is exercisable at any time at Jinongs discretion so long as such exercise and subsequent acquisition of the sales VIE companies does not violate PRC law. The consideration for the exercise of the Option is to be determined by the parties and memorialized in the future by definitive agreements setting forth the kind and value of such consideration. Jinong may transfer all rights and obligations under the Exclusive Option Agreements to any third parties without the approval of the shareholders of the sales VIE companies so long as a written notice is provided. The Exclusive Option Agreements may be terminated by mutual agreements or by 30 days written notice by Jinong.\nEquity Pledge Agreements\nPursuant to the terms of certain Equity Pledge Agreements dated June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, among Jinong and the shareholders of the sales VIE companies (the Pledge Agreements), the shareholders of the sales VIE companies pledged all of their equity interests in the sales VIE companies to Jinong, including the proceeds thereof, to guarantee all of Jinongs rights and benefits under the Entrusted Management Agreements, the Exclusive Technology Supply Agreements, the Shareholder Voting Proxy Agreements and the Exclusive Option Agreements. Prior to termination of the Pledge Agreements, the pledged equity interests cannot be transferred without Jinongs prior written consent. The Pledge Agreements may be terminated only upon the written agreement of the parties.\nNon-Compete Agreements\nPursuant to the terms of certain Non-Compete Agreements dated June 30, 2016 and January 1, 2017, among Jinong and the shareholders of the Targets (the Non-Compete Agreements), the shareholders of the Targets agreed that during the period beginning on the initial date of their services with Jinong, and ending five (5) years after termination of their services with Jinong, without Jinongs prior written consent, they will not provide services or accept positions (including partners, directors, shareholders, managers, proxies or consultants) with by any profit making organizations with businesses that may compete with Jinong. They will not solicit or interfere with any of Jinongs customers, or solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any person engaged or employed by Jinong to terminate his or her service or engagement.\nJinong acquired the Targets using the VIE arrangement based on our need to further develop our business and comply with the regulatory requirements under the PRC laws.\nAs our business focuses on the production of fertilizer, all our business activities intertwine with those in the agriculture industry in China. Specifically, we deal with compliance, regulation, safety, inspection, and licenses in fertilizer production, farmland use and transfer, growing and distribution of agriculture goods, agriculture basic supplies, seeds, pesticides, and trades of grains. It is an industry in which stringent regulations are implemented and strictly enforced. In addition, e-commerce, which is also under strict government regulations in the PRC, has lately become a sale and distribution channel for agricultural products. Currently, we are developing an online platform to connect the physical distribution network we either own or lease.\nCompared with the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions, the regulatory environment in the PRC is unique. For example, On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies promulgated the Regulation on Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (the M&A Rules), which became effective on September 8, 2006. The M&A Rules require that an offshore special purpose vehicle controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals and formed for purposes of overseas listing through acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC) prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicles securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles.\nFor both e-commerce and agriculture industries, PRC regulators limit the investment from foreign entities and set rules for foreign-owned entities to conduct business. We expect these limitations on foreign-owned entities will continue to exist in e-commerce and agriculture industries. VIE arrangements, however, provide feasibility for obtaining administrative approval process and avoiding industry restrictions that may be imposed on an entity that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign entity. The VIE agreements reduce uncertainty and the current limitation risk. It is our understanding that the VIE agreements, as well as the control we obtained through VIE arrangement, are valid and enforceable. We believe that this legal structure does not violate the known, published, and current PRC laws. While there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that the PRC authorities will take a view that is not contrary to or otherwise different from our belief and understanding stated above, we believe the substantial difficulty that we experienced previously to conduct business in agriculture as a foreign ownership company can be greatly reduced by the VIE arrangement. Further, as an integral part of the VIE arrangement, the underlying equity pledge agreements provide legal protection for the control we obtained. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, we have completed the equity pledge processes with the Targets to ensure the complete control of the interests in the Targets. The shareholders of the Targets are not entitled to transfer any shares to the third party under the exclusive option agreements. If necessary, they may transfer shares to us without consideration.\nWhile the VIE arrangement provides us with the feasibility to conduct our business in the e-commerce and agriculture industries, validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, (ii) possible judicial or administrative actions or any PRC Laws affecting creditors rights, (iii) certain equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the validity and enforceability of contractual rights generally under concepts of public interest, interests of the State, national security, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and applicable statutes of limitation; (iv) any circumstance in connection with formulation, execution or implementation of any legal documents that would be deemed materially mistaken, clearly unconscionable, fraudulent, coercive at the conclusions thereof; and (v) judicial discretion with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses, the calculation of damages, the entitlement to attorneys fees and other costs, and the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process. Validity and enforceability of VIE arrangements is also subject to risk derived from the discretion of any competent PRC legislative, administrative or judicial bodies in exercising their authority in the PRC. As a result, there can be no assurance that any of such PRC Laws will not be changed, amended or replaced in the immediate future or in the longer term with or without retrospective effect.\nOur History\nThe Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Kansas on February 6, 1987 under the name Videophone, Inc. The Company had no operations from December 1996 to December 2007. In October 2007, the Company was reincorporated in the state of Nevada. On December 26, 2007, the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Green New Jersey, through a share exchange (the Share Exchange). Because of the Share Exchange, the Company owns 100% of Green New Jersey. The Share Exchange occurred simultaneously with a private placement of $20,519,255 on December 26, 2007.\nGreen New Jersey was incorporated on January 27, 2007 under the laws of the State of New Jersey. On August 24, 2007, Green New Jersey acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Jinong, a company incorporated in the PRC on June 19, 2000.\nAfter the acquisition of Green New Jersey, the Company changed its name to China Green Agriculture, Inc., effective on February 5, 2008.\nOn July 23, 2009, Yuxing became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Jinong to facilitate the research and development of agricultural products and fertilizers. Effective June 16, 2013, Yuxing was converted into a PRC domestic enterprise wholly owned by an individual who entered into a series of contractual agreements with Jinong pursuant to which Yuxing became Jinongs variable interest entity or VIE.\nOn March 9, 2009, the Companys common stock was listed on the NYSE MKT, formerly known as NYSE Amex Equities under the trading symbol CGA. On December 4, 2009, the Company voluntarily ceased trading its common stock on the NYSE Amex Equities and transferred its listing to the New York Stock Exchange on December 7, 2009. The Companys ticker symbol remains CGA.\nOn July 2, 2010, the Company, through Jinong, consummated a transaction to acquire all equity interests of Gufeng and its subsidiary Tianjuyuan. As a result, Gufeng and Tianjuyuan became wholly owned subsidiaries of Jinong and indirect subsidiaries of the Company.\nOn June 30, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Jinong, entered strategic acquisition agreements and a series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of the following six companies that are organized under the laws of the PRC and would be deemed as our VIEs: Shaanxi Lishijie Agrochemical Co., Ltd., Songyuan Jinyangguang Sannong Service Co., Ltd., Shenqiu County Zhenbai Agriculture Co., Ltd., Weinan City Linwei District Wangtian Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., Aksu Xindeguo Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., and Xinjiang Xinyulei Eco-agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd.\nOn January 1, 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, entered into strategic acquisition agreements and a series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of the following two companies that are organized under the laws of the PRC and would be deemed as our VIEs: Sunwu County Xiangrong Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd. and Anhui Fengnong Seed Co., Ltd.\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, discontinued the strategic acquisition agreements and the series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of Zhenbai.\nOn June 2, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, discontinued the strategic acquisition agreements and the series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of Aksu Xindeguo Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd., Xinjiang Xinyulei Eco-agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd., and Sunwu County Xiangrong Agricultural Materials Co., Ltd.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, discontinued the strategic acquisition agreements and the series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of Lishijie.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, discontinued the strategic acquisition agreements and the series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of Fengnong.\nOn March 31, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Jinong, discontinued the strategic acquisition agreements and the series of contractual agreements with the shareholders of Jinyangguang and Wangtian.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 3rd Floor, Borough A, Block A. No. 181, South Taibai Road, Xian, Shaanxi Province, Peoples Republic of China 710065 and our telephone number is +86-29-88266368. Our website address is www.cgagri.com. The Company routinely posts important information on its website.\nOur current corporate structure is set forth in the following diagram:\nYuxing may also collectively be referred to as the VIE Company.\nIndustry Analysis\nFertilizer Market in China\nInfluenced by the sluggish demand in domestic and international fertilizer markets, Chinas fertilizer market is in a downturn during this fiscal year. In terms of production, the growth of fertilizer output remained limited during the fiscal year. Meanwhile, large inventories of fertilizer placed downward pressure on prices. Market prices of the raw material were volatile; the price of fertilizer is uncertain and can be hard to increase. In terms of domestic consumption, though grain prices increased to some extent, the domestic consumption capacity is limited; as for export, international markets are depressed continuously, resulting from the declines in export prices. During this fiscal year, the fertilizer industry was in a downward trend as profits are compressed again and the losses of enterprises are enlarged. Under the pressure of sluggish growth in the fertilizer market, industrial restructuring, merger and reorganization activity in the industry increased, reducing the number of enterprises in the market. At the same time, the production equipment and technological level was largely improved: coal-water slurry gasification technology, powdered coal pressure gasification technology, large sulfur-based compound fertilizer technology and beneficiation technology of mid-low-grade phosphate were widely used, while new fertilizer products such as slow controlled release fertilizer and microbial fertilizer have been rapidly developed and resulted in significant market expansion. In the last few years, as the growth of Chinas economy has gradually slowed down and the risk of economic downturn therefore exists, the government has adopted various measures to maintain the growth and the Company needs structural adjustment and growth pattern transformation.\nOn the one hand, governments support to agricultural production includes intensive agricultural investment, subsidies and minimum purchasing price increases for farm products. China has seen another bumper year of grain production, while increased fertilizer consumption remains highly uncertain. The country has achieved consecutive years of rising grain harvests since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China in 1949. As the concentration of the fertilizer industry is steadily improving, the influence on market from key enterprises have increased, which appeared to help to ease the weakened market volatility. On the other hand, the current oversupply problem is difficult to relieve. Mechanisms of price reform for raw materials (such as coal, natural gas, sulfur phosphate ore, etc.) are accelerating, which caused pressure on production costs. A stricter export tariff policy is expected to last indefinitely, and the external economic situation may limit the operation and expansion of fertilizer enterprises in international markets.\nThe interaction of the above factors complicated the situation in fertilizer markets since 2017. The overall growth rate of this industry has continually slowed down, and the market has fluctuated violently. The transformation for Chinas fertilizer industry from quantitative growth pattern to qualitative growth pattern is irreversible. The centralization of production, high-end oriented product, service-oriented marketing and market-oriented raw materials dominated the developments in the fertilizer market.\nAdditionally, government support for the agriculture industry in China can act as an additional boost to the fertilizer industry in China. However, we anticipate organic fertilizers will become an emerging segment in the coming years, given the additional subsidies for farming, elimination of certain land taxes, and land reform initiatives to be implemented by the PRC government to promote the growing of organic produce. We believe the demand for fertilizer will continue to grow because of increase in food demand, decrease in arable land and reduction of crop yields. The demand for fertilizers nationwide is continuously expected to increase by millions of tons of nutrient, with an expected compound annual growth rate of 7.7% from 2016 to 2022.\nOrganic versus Chemical Fertilizers\nIn general, fertilizer products are categorized into organic and chemical fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can be natural or developed artificially. Natural organic fertilizers include manure, slurry, worm castings, peat, seaweed, humic acid, brassin and guano. Artificial organic fertilizers include compost, blood meal, bone meal, humic acid, and are typically supplemented with other nutrient ingredients. Chemical fertilizers normally are composed of synthetic chemicals such as phosphate and potassium compounds. The primary difference between organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers is in the sourcing process of ingredients, as the nutrient contents are largely the same.\nOver the past 20 years, the use of chemical fertilizers in China substantially increased, but years of use created unintended consequences for the agriculture industry-agricultural products gradually lack certain minerals, since chemical fertilizers applied fell short of natural minerals which made soil infertile.\nIn addition, heavy use of chemical fertilizers can create fertilizer burn, the over-fertilization of a single nutrient such as nitrogen, which can dry roots and suspend crop growth due to the upset of balance in compound salts and soil acidification. Another drawback caused by chemical fertilizers is that soil is easily depleted by irrigation, rainfall and flooding. In addition, the production of chemical fertilizers consumes a great deal of natural resources. For example, the production of synthetic ammonia, a common chemical fertilizer, comprises about 5% of the worlds natural gas consumption.\nOrganic fertilizers, on the other hand, improve the biodiversity and long-term productivity of soil. Organic nutrients increase the abundance of soil organisms by providing organic micronutrients. Unlike chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizer nutrients are diluted with better solubility. It requires less application on soil to reach the same result as of chemical fertilizers, which maintains soil fertility and avoid the runoff caused by components like soluble nitrogen and phosphorus. However, the composition of organic fertilizer is more complex and costly than chemical products. As an alternative to pure chemical fertilizer use, farmers can also use inorganic fertilizer supplemented with a small portion of organic fertilizers.\nSince the 1980s, China has intensified the use of chemical fertilizers to increase crop yields. While the increase in crop yield slowed down in recent years, the overuse of chemical fertilizers also caused many environmental issues ranging from water pollution to soil damage. As a result, the PRC government has been promoting the use of environmentally friendly green fertilizers, such as humic acid-based organic compound fertilizers and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizers, because they provide crops with incremental yield by adding various nutrients essential to soil. Although being relatively new to farmers, the demand for these green fertilizers is increasing and we expect this trend to continue in the coming years. Although we expanded business among other Asian and Southeast Asian countries, the PRC remained our principal market for organic compound fertilizers and related agricultural products.\nThe Green Food Industry in the PRC\nThe rise of the PRC industry for food free from pollutants or harmful chemicals, or green food, raises the demand for organic fertilizers. Green Food, the certificate for agricultural products promoted by the Chinese Government, is positioned between ordinary agricultural food from common farming practice and organic food and has two levels: AA Green Food and A Green Food. The AA Green Food standard indicates products that are equal to those of organic agriculture. Since the market for organic agricultural products in China has huge potential, it is forecasted that the increase of organic agricultural products consumption in China will exceed that of the average organic agricultural products consumption in the world in the next few years. The market for Chinese organic agricultural products reached USD 5 billion in 2015, with an incremental 20 percent increase year over year during the following years.\nWith the rapid development of the organic food industry in China, an increasing number of companies have been entering into the green food sector to utilize market opportunities. In 1990, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture began to promote the production of green food. In 1992, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture established the China Green Food Development Center (CGFDC) to supervise the development and management of green food at the national and provincial levels in the PRC. In 1993, the PRC Ministry of Agriculture established regulations for green food labeling; in 1996, a trademark for green food was registered and put into use in the PRC.\nCrops grown with the use of our products are qualified for the AA Green Food certificate. As noted above, the AA rating indicates that the crops contain minimal chemical residue from fertilizers. Although our products are not qualified for the AA Green Food certificate, they are (except for the products from Gufeng) certified as Green Food Production Material by the CGFDC.\nAccording to the statistics from the CGFDC, Chinas annual output of green food reached 15 million tons in 2008. However, the domestic consumption level remains relatively low, comprising approximately 3% of the market share of food commodities. The low consumption level is primarily due to: (i) small scale of production of green food; (ii) lack of consumer awareness of green food and (iii) the presence of counterfeit green food products that adversely affect consumers perception of green food.\nAs described by the CGFDC, the development strategies for Chinas green food industry are as follows: first, maintain high quality standards and focus on developing key products; second, promote and facilitate the industrialization of green food; third, implement an integrated development strategy emphasizing producers, production base and farmers; fourth, accelerate the pace of development with the aid of the government; and fifth, to carry out an international development strategy aimed at promoting exports.\nAccording to the Investment and Forecast Report on China Green Food Industry 2012-2016 by Research in China, a Chinese market research company, the green food industry is a high growth industry with significant investment potential. According to the report, leading green food producers will experience huge growth when they achieve national and provincial agricultural industrialization with the support of favorable government policies and tax incentives.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe believe that our increased production capacity and our research and development capability, along with the new sales segment, positions us to benefit from the anticipated growth of the PRC fertilizer market. We expect to expand sales and grow revenues through the following strategies:\n\u2610 Expand Capacity and Diversify Product Offerings. Our current annual fertilizer production capacity is 555,000 metric tons and our production portfolio of fertilizers includes 416 products. In the future, we will expand our existing production lines, develop new products and acquire certain PRC fertilizer manufacturers that complement our product lines.\n\u2610 Capitalize on Synergies Created by Research and Development Efforts. Regarding the construction of Yuxings research and development center, we have established 98 sunlight greenhouses and six intelligent greenhouses. We expect the Yuxing facility to help us shorten the fertilizer market cycle by providing an advanced testing field for new products which are manufactured by Jinong. In addition, by making efforts in research and development, we expect to simultaneously facilitate the production of superior agricultural products, such as flower bulbs, flowers, fruits and vegetables, which would eventually increase revenues.\n\u2610 Develop new advanced highly efficient fertilizers. The new fertilizer products represented by slow controlled-release fertilizer, microbial fertilizer and others, are developed rapidly with high market expansion. Gufeng develops the Tianjuyuan controlled-release fertilizer. The objective is to provide Gufeng with fertilizer agent to improve the control release effectiveness when producing controlled-release compound fertilizers. We expect that Gufengs controlled-release compound fertilizer will have an advantageous position in the market.\nProducts\nOur principal products are our own fertilizers, which consist of liquid, granular and powdered fertilizers and various kinds of compound fertilizers developed to increase crop yields. We can manufacture 416 fertilizer products from humic acid-based fertilizers to compound fertilizers. In Yuxing, we produce high quality agricultural products such as fruits, vegetables and flowers for commercial sale. In our sales segment, we sell various products such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds. These products are either manufactured by us or by other manufacturers.\nFertilizer Products\nFertilizer manufacturing is our core business, which accounts for approximately 88.4% of total revenues. The self-manufactured fertilizers are produced and sold through Jinong and Gufeng. We believe that Jinong utilizes one of the most advanced automated humic acid production lines in China. Humic acid is a complex with natural, organic ingredients essential to make soil fertile. Humic acid-rich material, such as peat, lignite or weathered coal generating naturally from decomposed plant or animal remains, is one of the major organic constituents for soil composition. Humic acid exhibits a high capacity for cation exchange (a chemical process in which cations of like charge are exchanged equally between a solid and a solution), which serves to chelate plant nutrient elements and release them as the plant requires. The chelation process prevents leaching of nutrients by holding them in the soil solution. Moreover, humic acids can bind soil toxins along with plant nutrients, thereby strongly stabilizing soil. The regular use of humic acid organic liquid compound fertilizer can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizer, insecticide, herbicide and water. This mechanism contributes to environmental protection by preventing contamination of water sources caused by runoff.\nIn nature, humic acid improves soil structure and aeration, nutrient absorption and water retention. It also increases soils buffering capacity against fluctuations in PH levels, and reduces soil crusting and erosion from wind and water as well as radical toxic pollutants. Humic acid promotes the developing of root systems, seed germination and overall plant growth. It also enhances health, resilience and overall appearance of plants. We believe there is no synthetic material currently known to match humic acids effectiveness and versatility.\nThe pure humic acid used in our fertilizers is distilled and extracted from weathered coal by way of alkaline digestion and acid recrystallization. Our Jinong fertilizers are principally used as a foliar fertilizer (a liquid, water-soluble fertilizer applied to a plants foliage by a fine spray, so the plant absorbs the nutrients through its leaves), through spraying directly on soil or injecting into the irrigation systems. Benefits of using our products are to stimulate the growth and yield of plants, protecting them from drought, disease and temperature damages while improving soil structure and fertility.\nGufeng and Tianjuyuan produce compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizers, highly concentrated water-soluble fertilizers, and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer. Gufeng sells its products under four brands: KEBA, Mei Er An, Huang Cheng Gen and SPR HOP, which are all registered trademarks in the PRC. Tianjuyuans products are marketed under the brands AGR GFJ and T.J.Y. which are both PRC registered trademarks.\nWe have a multi-tiered product line of 416 fertilizer products, covering humic acid-based compound fertilizer produced through Jinong, and organic/inorganic compound fertilizer through Gufeng.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $160,657,513, $200,245,680, and $200,185,739, respectively, in gross revenues from sales of our fertilizer products, representing 88.4%, 83.5%, and 80.3% of our total revenues for such periods. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan manufacture a total of 336 fertilizer products. 47.7% of Gufengs fertilizer revenue came from humic acid compound fertilizers and 52.3% from compound fertilizer for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nAgricultural Products\nOur subsidiary, Yuxing, one of Jinongs VIEs, produces top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings for commercial sale. The gross revenues from the sale of our agricultural products for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $11,356,390, $11,038,666, and $9,227,113, respectively, representing 6.2%, 4.6%, and 3.7% of our total revenues, respectively.\nYuxing was originally established to be the research and development base for humic acid fertilizers produced by Jinong. By simulating the growing conditions and cycles of various plants, such as flowers, vegetables and seedlings, Yuxing regularly conducts experimental testing to enhance the efficacy of our new fertilizers.\nFertilizer Manufacturing Process\nOur production lines employ scientifically designed production procedures and strict quality control systems to ensure high quality in our products. These production lines are fully automated and operated by a central control system with minimal manual input by technicians. The machinery and vats for the line are supplied by a local medical machinery manufacturer and the automatic control systems were developed by us. Our access management system always protects the proprietary ingredient mixes from any unauthorized use. Our computer server is connected to the electronic scales on each of the material input bins to ensure that the exact quantity of each element or ingredient is delivered correctly, thus maintaining product quality and reduce waste. Our production line producing liquid fertilizer and powered fertilizer is centrally controlled by a wireless panoramic audio and video monitoring system that allows connectivity with mobile terminals such as cell phones.\nIn Jinong, we operate a 6,495 square meters (69,911 square feet) facility that manufactures liquid fertilizer products and a 13,803-square meter (148,576 square feet) facility that produces liquid and highly concentrated (powdered) fertilizers. Jinongs total annual production capacity at these facilities is 55,000 metric tons.\nIn Gufeng and Tianjuyuan, we operate eight manufacturing facilities located in No. 6 Mafang Logistics Park, Pinggu, Beijing. These facilities produce various kinds of fertilizers and have a total annual production capacity of 500,000 metric tons.\nThe manufacturing techniques utilized by Gufeng include extruder granulation, rotary drum steam granulation, urea-based spraying granulation and resin-coated sustained release, which enable Gufeng to effectively meet the production requirements of all different compound fertilizers. To ensure high quality, Gufeng and Tianjuyuan employ strict quality controls from the raw materials purchases to the products sales to end users.\nWe produced and sold a total of approximately 287,160 metric tons of fertilizer products during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nRaw Materials and Suppliers\nFertilizer Products\nAmong the three materials utilized to produce humic acid (weathered coal, lignite and peat), we have chosen weathered coal as a key raw material because it is abundant and economical for production. We have been sourcing the humic acid from different regions including Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.\nIn addition to weathered coal, we use approximately 50 different components in our production process, including elements such as sodium, calcium, zinc, iron and potassium, all of which can be readily obtained from local markets. We utilize spectral analysis technology to select raw materials with the best quality, and we have specially trained buyers to ensure the consistency of raw materials procured.\nThe fertilizer products that Gufeng and Tianjuyuan manufacture incorporate over 50 different raw materials, including coal, sulfuric acid and NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) related compounds such as amide and hydro nitrogen. Gufeng sources these supplies largely from neighboring provinces and regions, such as Hebei and Shaanxi provinces, and the Municipality of Beijing, for the economical transportation costs.\nOur products are packaged in bottles, bags and boxes. Each type of packaging material, along with packaging labels, is readily available for purchase from manufacturers in Shaanxi, Beijing, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces.\nAgricultural Products\nThe plants that generate our top-grade flowers and multi-colored seedlings are mainly planted and cultivated in research and development facilities maintained by Yuxing. We purchase seeds of green vegetables and fruits from agricultural companies, such as RijkZwaan Company, which imports the seeds from foreign markets, including Holland. We cultivate our agricultural products by applying fertilizers produced by Jinong.\nInventory\nFor our fertilizer products, our efficient production methods allow us to maintain appropriate inventory levels, which keep inventory costs reasonable. We purchase raw materials and packaging materials based on demands and business forecasts. Products, in various formulas and different batches, with customized volumes, are shipped to distributors and users after production in response to orders we receive.\nFor our agricultural products, we maintain corresponding inventory to both the anticipated demand from customers and other needs, as we often use certain agricultural products to serve our product testing base for research and development purposes.\nSeasonality\nThe peak season to sell fertilizer products is from January through June. However, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, Jinong did not experience significant seasonal variation with respect to its fertilizer sales since approximately 44.8% of its annual sales revenue occurred in the third fiscal quarter (winter) and the fourth fiscal quarter (spring). Usually, Gufengs sales of compound fertilizer undergoes significant seasonal variation in China. Correspondingly, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, Gufeng experienced seasonal variation. 65.0% of Gufengs annual sales revenue occurred in the third fiscal quarter (winter) and the fourth fiscal quarter (spring).\nThe purchase of its raw material, basic fertilizers, is affected by the supply and demand in the fertilizer market with seasonality. Over non-peak sales season, when the raw material price is low and economical, Gufeng may choose to place larger orders for raw materials as its export business offsets the seasonality when exports are made to southern Asia, such as India, where the selling season corresponds to the non-peak season in China.\nThe peak selling season for our agricultural products is from October until March, namely our second fiscal quarter (fall) and the third fiscal quarter (winter). This is primarily due to the strong demand for high-end fruits and decorative flowers during the holiday seasons.\nMarketing, Distribution and Customers\nOverview\nWe currently market our own fertilizer products to private wholesalers and retailers of agricultural farm products in 22 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 4 central government-controlled municipalities in China. For the fiscal year 2022, the following five PRC provinces collectively accounted for 70.2% of our fertilizer manufacturing revenue: Hebei (34.4%), Heilongjiang (12.6%), Inner Mongolia (9.4%), Liaoning (9.1%), and Shaanxi (4.7%). We believe this geographically diverse distribution helps us to become a leader in the compound fertilizer market as compared to regional competitors because we are not heavily dependent on any single geographic area for sales and are able to raise our brand and product awareness nationwide. We also manufacture our fertilizer products for export through contracted distributors in foreign countries, including India and Africa. Total revenues from exported products accounted for approximately 0.3% of our total fertilizer revenues in fiscal 2022.\nOur agricultural products are distributed through various channels in Shaanxi Province and other provinces. Decorative flowers are usually sold through our fertilizer distributors to end-users such as flower shops, luxury hotels and government agencies. Fruits and vegetables are sold to high-end supermarkets and upscale restaurants. Seedlings are sold primarily to departments of city planning.\nA multi-tiered product strategy allows us to tailor our fertilizer products to the needs and preferences of the various geographic regions in China. Our fertilizers can be tailored to different crops grown in varying climate and soil conditions. For example, climate and rainfall conditions in Southern and Eastern China allow farmers to grow high margin crops such as fruit and seasonal vegetables. As a result, these farmers are willing to invest in expensive and specialized fertilizers. In contrast, we market low-cost fertilizers to farmers in the Northwest areas of China due to the inclement weather.\nOur research and development capabilities allow us to tailor products to meet specific farming needs in considering different factors such as crops species, humidity, weather and soil conditions.\nMarketing\nOur marketing staff is trained to closely work with distributors and customers, including retailers and farmers, providing professional advice on customizing our products to customer needs and offering agricultural knowledge and other extensive customer support. In addition, our employees educate and communicate with distributors and customers by regularly organizing training courses on new agricultural techniques.\nCompared with industry norms, we believe our product development cycle of three to nine months is relatively short. Through our regular collection of market data, including growth records of a variety of plants cultivated in different soil and climate conditions, together with feedbacks from our end-users, we can conduct nationwide market analysis, ascertain new product needs, estimate demand and customer demographics and develop new products tailored to current market needs.\nAlthough we utilize television advertisements and mass media, most of our marketing efforts are conducted through joint activities with distributors. Our sales and marketing staff work with and train distributors and retail clients through lectures and interactive meetings. We emphasize the technological components of our products to end-users to help them understand the differences in products and how to effectively use them. Word-of-mouth advertising and sample trials of new products in new areas are also essential components of our marketing efforts. In addition, we have established nationwide telephone hotlines to answer questions and have constructed an SMS text message platform to allow real-time interaction with customers.\nOur best-selling self-manufactured fertilizers, based on revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, are listed below:\nPercent of\nVolume\nRevenues\nFertilizer\nRanking\nProduct Names\n(Tons)\n(USD)\nSales\nOrganic/Inorganic Compound Fertilizer (humic acid) NPK46%\n102,528\n48,749,704\n29.5 %\nGufeng Compound Fertilizer NPK40%\n108,463\n48,130,731\n29.1 %\nGufeng Compound Fertilizer Other\n8,270\n1,867,499\n1.1 %\nGufeng Compound Fertilizer NPK51%\n2,748\n1,243,049\n0.8 %\nJinong Chongshifei Fertilizer (humic acid)\n1,182,603\n0.7 %\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn the fiscal year 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread rapidly across the world in the first half year of 2020 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to significantly affect our operating businesses in February and March and adversely affected nearly all our operations in the second quarter, although such effects may vary significantly. The duration and extent of the effects over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The risks and uncertainties resulting from the pandemic that may affect our future earnings, cash flows and financial condition include the closure of our various office buildings and facilities and the long-term effect on the demand for our products and services. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including the evaluations of bad debt expense. More information concerning the effects of COVID-19 is included in Note 22.\nFertilizer Products\nThe fertilizer product market in China is highly fragmented. Our primary sales strategy is to establish contractual relationships with qualified distributors throughout the country, who, in turn, will distribute our products to wholesalers and retailers, and ultimately, the farmers.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we sold our products through a nationwide constructed network of about 1,398 distributors covering 22 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 4 central government-controlled municipalities in China.\nThe distributors sell our products to the smaller, local wholesale and retail outlets who then sell to the end-users, typically farmers. We do not grant provincial or regional exclusivity because there is currently no single distributor sufficiently dominant to warrant exclusivity. We enter into non-exclusive written distribution agreements with chosen distributors that demonstrate their ability in regional sales networks. The distribution agreements do not dictate distribution quantity because changes in weather and local market could dramatically affect sales quotas.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, sales of our self-manufactured products to our top five distributors accounted for approximately 49.9% of our revenues. As we do not depend on specific customers, we believe that the loss of single customers would not have any significant effect on our business.\nAgricultural Products\nWe distribute our agricultural products through several networks depending on the type of product. Our top-grade flowers are mainly distributed through our fertilizer distribution network; our green vegetables and fruits are mainly distributed to a variety of wholesale markets and supermarkets in Xian, while our multi-colored seedlings are distributed to the seedling centers and planting companies in China with which we have had long-term cooperation.\nRetail Stores and Authorized Retailers\nWe have successfully implemented two marketing programs in Shaanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu and Guangzhou provinces. These marketing programs consist of: (i) establishment of Company directly owned retail stores to sell fertilizer products produced by Jinong and Gufeng through the designated sales personnel (the Pilot Program) and (ii) selection of qualified retailers from the Companys distributor base to be designated as authorized retailers. With the Pilot Program, we have worked closely with our distributors, with each distributors outlet having an assigned territory in order not to compete with other existing distributors. We had entered into agreements with these retailers on their exhibits, and we had well-positioned standardized shelves and product displays in their retail stores. In addition, we provide the retailers with educational materials on proper product use and billboard ads with our product logo to attract target farmers.\nResearch and Development\nWe conduct the bulk of our research and development activities through Yuxing. Through Yuxing, we cultivate high-quality flowers, green vegetables and fruits in our own greenhouses and sell them to various end-users, including airlines, hotels and restaurants. Yuxing operates advanced research and development facilities that: (i) provide testing and an experimental data collection base for new fertilizers produced by Jinong by simulating the growing conditions and development stages of a variety of plants, such as flowers, vegetables and seedlings, and (ii) increase our capability to produce more products while shortening the new product development cycle, which allows us to release products to market quickly, thus increasing revenues and market share. In addition, our research and development capabilities allow us to develop products tailored to specific farming needs generated by different crop species, humidity, weather and soil conditions. Flowers, fruits and vegetables grown from experimental testing of Jinongs humic acid compound fertilizers are of high quality and are sold to local supermarkets and airline companies.\nThe capital expenditure and other payments on Yuxings construction, net of accumulated depreciation, were approximately $6,988,882, $8,295,772 and $8,414,911 during the fiscal years ending of June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The research and development center helps expand our output of high-quality agricultural products for commercial sale while providing an advanced testing field for new products. The facility at Yuxing enhances our capability to produce more products while shortening the development cycle, thus increasing revenues and market share. In addition to developing new humic acid-based fertilizer products, we plan to develop other agricultural derivatives such as humic-acid based organic pesticides, which can provide additional revenue sources. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we sold approximately $11,356,390 of these agricultural products.\nFY 2022 FY 2021 FY 2020\nMachines, Buildings and Equipment $ 6,926,023 $ 8,198,256 $ 8,355,336\nConstruction in Progress $ 10,600 $ 97,516 $ 59,575\nTotal $ 6,988,882 $ 8,295,772 $ 8,414,911\nNew Products\nWith our research and development capabilities, we have developed 416 products and continue to develop new products. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we developed 11 new products of liquid fertilizers.\nIn addition to developing new fertilizer products, we also developed soilless seeding and breeding of colored-leaf plants, rare flowers and new species of fruits and vegetables.\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold the following trademarks registered with the PRC Trademark Offices of National Industrial and Commerce Administrative Bureau (the PRC Trademark Offices):\nTrademark\nRegistration Number\nValid term\nHuang Cheng Gen\nNo.5219720\nJune 28, 2019 to June 27,\nMei Er An\nNo.1508004\nJanuary 21, 2021 to January 20, 2031\nKEBA\nNo.10045980\nDecember 07, 2012 to December 06, 2022\nKEBA\nNo.10046405\nDecember 14, 2012 to December 13, 2022\nKEBA\nNo.10045898\nMarch 07, 2013 to March 06, 2023\nKEBA\nNo.10046344\nMarch 07, 2013 to March 06, 2023\nAGR GFJ\nNo.3320281\nMay 28, 2014 to May 27,\nSPR HOP\nNo.3320282\nMay 28, 2014 to May 27,\nT.J.Y\nNo.3320283\nMay 28, 2014 to May 27,\nKEBA\nNo.760379\nAugust 14, 2005 to August 13, 2025\nA registered trademark is protected in China for a term of 10 years, and it is renewable for another 10-year term under the PRC trademark law if the renewal application is submitted to the PRC Trademark Offices within 6 months prior to the expiration of the previous term.\nListed below are Jinongs four patents for a fertilizer formulation and a proprietary production line and manufacturing processes.\nInventors\nDate of\nPatent/Pending\nPatent No./\nName and\nDate of\nPublication and\nPatent Application\nType of Patent\nApplication No.\nPatent Holder\nApplication\nTerm\nPatent:\nUtility Model\nApplication No.:\nApplicant:\nFebruary 1, 2007\nNovember 24,\nMethod and recipe of the water-soluble humic acid fertilizers\nPatent\nZL200710017334.x\nJinong\n2010;\n20 years\nPatent:\nUtility Model\nApplication No.:\nApplicant:\nSeptember 22, 2011\nDecember 4, 2013;\nProduction method of Organic Fertilizer\nPatent\nZL201110282544.8\nJinong\nyears\nPatent:\nUtility Model\nApplication No.:\nApplicant:\nAugust 15, 2013\nFebruary 11, 2015;\nMethod and recipe of the water-soluble high concentration humic acid fertilizers\nPatent\nZL201310357167.9\nJinong\nyears\nPatent:\nUtility Model\nApplication No.:\nApplicant:\nJanuary 17, 2014\nApril 08, 2015;\nProduction method of Multifunctional liquid calcium fertilizer\nPatent\nNL 201410020442.2\nJinong\nYears\nThe PRC Patent Law was adopted by the PRC National Peoples Congress in 1984 and was subsequently amended in 1992 and 2000. Under the PRC Patent Law, an invention patent is valid for a term of 20 years and a utility or design patent is valid for a term of 10 years. Both of our registered patents are utility patents. Any use of our patent without consent or a proper license from us constitutes an infringement of patent rights.\nIn addition to trademark and patent protection in China, we also rely on contractual confidentiality provisions to protect our brand and intellectual property rights. To safeguard these rights our research and development personnel and executive officers are subject to confidentiality agreements. They are also subject to a non-competition covenant following the termination of employment. They also agree that all work products belong to us. Moreover, we take steps to limit the number of personnel involved in the production process and, instead of disclosing fertilizer ingredients to employees, we refer to the ingredients by numbers.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe our products possess the following competitive advantages which enable us to compete in the PRC fertilizer market.\nNation-wide sales network. In the highly fragmented Chinese fertilizer market, we have established our own distribution channels with private distributors that sell our products to retail stores and farmers throughout China. We have over 1,398 distributors nationwide across 22 provinces, 4 autonomous regions and 4 central government-controlled municipalities in China. Most of our competitors do not have a sales team as large as ours that specializes in the sale of compound fertilizer products. Moreover, we believe the regional strengths of Gufengs distribution network have expanded and will continue to expand our sales coverage to certain cities and counties as well as foreign markets.\nStrong Research and Development. Our research and development are managed effectively. Typically, it takes only three to nine months from the decision to develop a new product to mass production, which ensures product flow and helps to maintain market share. Our strong research and development department is based on our intelligent greenhouse facilities. The advanced equipment and soil-free techniques in such facilities simulate the natural environment in different areas and control selected factors. Since most of Jinongs experimental work is conducted in Yuxings greenhouse facilities, thereby speeding up development cycles, we can reduce costs without sacrificing accurate results. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we generated approximately $11,356,390 revenue from sales of Yuxings agricultural products, and we anticipate that this source of revenue will grow in the future. We have built 98 sunlight greenhouses and six intelligent greenhouses on an 88-acre parcel of land relating to Yuxings pending research and development center, which expands output of high-quality agricultural products for commercial sale while providing an advanced testing field for new products.\nGufeng and Tianjuyuan have developed seven technologies:\n(1) Drying fan for urea-based compound fertilizer;\n(2) Heat balance control system for flexible compound fertilizer;\n(3) Automatic control system for the anti-block of compound fertilizer;\n(4) Water control technology for low nitrogen, low potassium and high phosphorus compound fertilizer;\n(5) Manufacturing technology for salt-alkaline resistance and soil improvement of compound fertilizer (The company won the third prize for Progress in Science and Technology in Pinggu District Beijing with this technology);\n(6) Manufacturing technology for compound HA fertilizer with high density (NPK \u2265 51%); and\n(7) Manufacturing technology for the sustained release of blending and compound fertilizer.\nWhile we believe our greenhouse facilities provide us with a competitive advantage over the competitors, some of them may still have better understanding in certain local markets where they have successfully marketed products over a period and have developed specifically formulated fertilizers for local plants, soil and climate conditions. To enhance our competitiveness, we will seek to diversify our fertilizers to benefit a wider range of plants and soil conditions.\nWell-known Brands. We believe customers have strong brand recognition and make purchase decisions accordingly. Jinong, KEBA and T.J.Y. are registered trademarks and are well recognized by end users; in addition, certain large national fertilizer traders, such as Sinoagri Holding Company Limited, one of the largest domestic fertilizer traders in China, had strong brand preference for Gufengs fertilizer products. Gufeng sells its products under four brands, namely KEBA, Mei Er An, Huangchenggen and SPR HOP. Tianjuyuans products are marketed under the brands AGR GFJ and T.J.Y. The primary products sold under the Gufeng and Tianjuyuan brands include organic/inorganic compound fertilizer (humic acid) with NPK \u2265 40%, and organic /inorganic compound fertilizer (humic acid) with NPK \u2265 48%.\nAutomated Production Line and Process. All Jinongs major production procedures are controlled by a centralized computer system only accessible by authorized personnel. Jinongs production lines are fully automated to ensure that content in each product is measured exactly according to its recipe by linking the computer server with the electronic weights on each material input bin. In addition, spectral analysis is used to accurately check the composition of materials. During the fiscal year 2021, Jinongs highly advanced production lines can manufacture a multi-tiered line of 103 fertilizer products, and we believe that Jinongs production lines are among the few advanced lines in the Chinese industry. As mentioned above, we have patent protection for Jinongs two proprietary production lines, one of which has medical grade production equipment with precise quality control, and the other can produce liquid, powder and granular fertilizers. We currently have an annual production capacity of 555,000 metric tons.\nCompetition\nFertilizer Products\nBased on our internal estimates, there are approximately 2,000 organic fertilizer manufacturers in China, with no discernible market leaders in the sector. We believe our competitors are currently comprised of approximately 90% small-sized local manufacturers and 10% large national manufacturers. We believe we are among the large national fertilizer manufacturers.\nGufengs primary competitor is Stanley Fertilizer Co., Ltd. (Stanley), a compound fertilizer manufacturer based in Linyi, Shandong Province, which was listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange (China) in June 2011. Stanley manufactures various kinds of compound fertilizers and tailored fertilizers which directly compete with Gufeng.\nThe smaller competitors are generally producers of amino acid compound fertilizers, which are very price competitive.\nHowever, lacking adequate quality or process control technologies, these companies often sell products with inconsistent quality.\nThe Chinese fertilizer market has been fully opened to foreign companies since Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2006. Accordingly, the PRC government has increased its fertilizer import quota and, since January 2007, has reduced the import tariffs on foreign fertilizer to 1%. However, foreign fertilizers are generally more expensive than PRC manufactured fertilizers and are not customized to soil conditions influenced by Chinas diverse climate and terrains.\nAgricultural Products\nThe competitive market of our agriculture products varies among our three main products: Top-grade flowers, green vegetables and fruits, multi-colored seedlings.\nTop-grade Flowers: The growers in the flowers and flower seedlings businesses are largely locally based. We believe that our flower products have comparative advantages in terms of the advanced technologies we apply, the superior species of the seedlings we select and the efficiency and stability due to strict quality control. In addition, our greenhouse facilities enable us to produce flower seedlings year-round.\nGreen Vegetables and Fruits: Our competitors are primarily the vegetable planting centers and planters in Shaanxi, Shandong and Gansu provinces that produce vegetables such as cucumbers and peppers. With the aid from our green fertilizers that improve soil conditions and limit bacterial growth, our competitive advantage lies in the advanced greenhouse facilities which contribute to the pollution-free end products.\nMulti-colored Seedlings: In the market of Multi-colored seedlings, our competitors are from nationwide. Some of our products, such as red photiniaserrulata, are also imported from other countries with high survival rates.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business operations are subject to various laws, including environmental, health and workplace safety laws issued by governmental agencies on the provincial and state levels. Business and company registrations, along with the products, are monitored through the issuance of licenses and certificates including the following:\nGreen Certification. Except for those manufactured by Gufeng and Tianjuyuan, all our fertilizer products are certified by the CGFDC as Green Food Production Material. Currently, the CGFDC provides two different certifications within the green food industry: Green Food Certification granted to edible foods, and Green Food Production Material Certification granted to production materials such as our fertilizers. A Green Food Production Material Certification was issued to Jinong in March 2015 and renewed in 2018 and 2021. The certificate is renewable with an application within 90 days prior to the expiration.\nOperating license. Our operating license enables us to (1) undertake research and development, production, sales and services of humic-acid liquid fertilizer, (2) sell pesticides, and (3) export and import products, technology and equipment. Jinongs license (Registration No. 610000100003655) is valid until August 8, 2057, and the license is renewable. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan maintain valid operating licenses with expiration dates of August 1, 2043 (for the license with Registration No. 110000008250498) and August 7, 2021 (for the license with Registration No.110117003157142), respectively.\nFertilizer Registration. Fertilizer registration is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the PRC and is required for producing fertilizers. There are two kinds of registrations: interim registration and formal registration. The interim registration is valid for one year and applies to fertilizers in the stages of in-the-field testing and test selling; fertilizers that have completed in-the-field testing and test selling must obtain formal registration, which, if granted, is valid for five years, and thereafter must be renewed every five years. Jinong currently holds 16 formal fertilizer registration certificates. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan hold 11 interim fertilizer certificates and 259 formal certificates.\nAs of the date of this Report, we believe we are in material compliance with all registrations and requirements for the issuance and maintenance of all licenses required to conduct our businesses and operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Report. Our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these risks, which could result in a decline in the market price of our securities, causing you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe industry in which we do business is highly fragmented and competitive and we face competition from numerous fertilizer manufacturers in China and elsewhere.\nWe compete with numerous local Chinese fertilizer manufacturers. Although we may have greater resources than many of our competitors, most of which are small local fertilizer companies, it is possible that these competitors have better access in certain local markets, an enhanced ability to customize products to certain regions and better-established local distribution channels. We also compete with large national competitors in the PRC. Although we have advanced automated humic acid-based fertilizer production lines and greenhouse supported research and development centers, we cannot assure that such large competitors will not develop their own similar production or research and development facilities. Further, Chinas access into the World Trade Organization has led to increased foreign competition for us. International producers and traders import products into China that generally are of higher quality than those produced by the local Chinese manufacturers. If they are localized and become familiar with fertilizers we produce, we may face additional competition. If we are not successful in our research, development and production of new products and/or in our marketing and advertising efforts to increase awareness of our brands, our revenues could decline, which might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nOur major competitors may be able to endure downturns in our industrial sector more than we are. When facing reduced demand for our products, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing selling prices to meet competition, or to maintain the prices while sacrificing a portion of market share. Our overall profitability likely would be reduced in either case. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional competitors will not enter our existing markets, or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nIf we are unable to design, manufacture, and market fertilizer products in a timely and efficient manner, we may not remain as competitive.\nMany of our fertilizer products are characterized by short product development cycles as they target the unique climate and soil conditions where our customers are located. Accordingly, we devote a substantial number of resources to product development. To compete successfully, we must develop new and/or improved fertilizer products that cater to customer needs. New fertilizers may not be easily developed. As a result, we may experience performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks and cost overruns. Our inability to develop and offer new and/or improved fertilizer products or to achieve customer acceptance of these products could limit our ability to compete in the market or to grow revenues at a desired rate.\nOur proprietary fertilizer formula may become obsolete or be unintentionally disclosed to competitors, which could materially adversely affect the competitiveness of our future fertilizer products.\nOur proprietary fertilizer formula is the base for producing our fertilizer. Our future success will depend upon our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supplying existing humic acid fertilizer products and by developing new products on a timely basis that keep pace with the evolving industry standards and changing customer requests. If our proprietary formula becomes obsolete because our competitors develop better products, our future business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality agreements with key employees, we cannot assure that if there were a breach of such agreement by an employee, we would not lose any competitive advantage that we currently have with respect to our proprietary fertilizer formula. If we are forced to take legal action to protect our proprietary formula, we will incur significant expense, and a favorable outcome cannot be guaranteed.\nIf our warehouse selling and credit sales of certain fertilizer products continue to increase and we fail to collect the accounts receivables that are due in a timely manner, our financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.\nWe had accounts receivable of $28,792,891 as of June 30, 2022, as compared to $102,783,004 and $99,052,071 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, decreases of $73,990,113 and increases of $3,730,933, or 72.0% and 3.8% year over year. The decreases were primarily due to discontinuing sales VIEs.\nWe offer a tentative credit period up to 180 days to our customers. Although we perform routine assessment of our customers creditworthiness, evaluate the structure and collectability of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts, when necessary, we may not be able to receive or collect payment for our products on time or at all if our customers encounter difficulties in their businesses. Any such failure may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur concentration of customers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nGufengs top five distributors accounted for 80.9% of its revenues, with its largest distributor accounting for 16.4% of total revenues for the 2022 fiscal year. Jinongs top five distributors accounted for 4.6% of its fertilizer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. If those major customers reduce or discontinue their product purchases from us and we are unable to find their replacements, it will adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be exposed to intellectual property infringement and the value of our intellectual property rights could diminish.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nJinong is the holder of four registered patents. The first patent is a fertilizer formulation named Method and Recipe of the Water-Soluble Humic Acid Fertilizers. The second patent, Production Facility of Humic Acid Products, relates to our proprietary production line and manufacturing processes in the PRC. The third patent is Production Method of Organic Fertilizer. The fourth patent is Production method of Multifunctional liquid calcium fertilizer. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan do not have patents but currently possess seven proprietary technologies. However, we cannot predict the degree and range of protection patents and confidentiality agreements with respect to proprietary technologies will defend us against competitors. Third parties may find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents and proprietary technologies. Third parties may attempt to obtain patents claiming aspects like our patent applications. We cannot assure you that our current or potential competitors do not have, and will not obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products in the PRC.\nIf we need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings, such actions may be costly and may divert management attention as well as consume other resources which could otherwise have been devoted to our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation. In addition, historically, implementation of PRC intellectual property-related laws has been lacking, primarily because of ambiguities in the PRC laws and difficulties in enforcement. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as those in the United States or other countries, which increases the risk that we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property. Moreover, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Future litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our managements attention and resources, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Given the relative unpredictability of Chinas legal system and potential difficulties enforcing court judgments in China, there is no guarantee that we would be able to halt any unauthorized use of our intellectual property through litigation.\nIf we infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages and compelled to defend against claims by third parties, which, if successful, could cause us to pay significant damage awards and incur other costs.\nOur success also depends in large part on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. As litigation becomes more common in the PRC in resolving commercial disputes, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. The validity and scope of claims relating to humic acid fertilizer production technology and related devices and machine patents involve complex technical, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. Also, the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability, including damage awards to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all), to pay ongoing royalties, or to redesign our products or subject us to injunctions preventing the manufacture and sale of our products. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation.\nDisruptions in the supply of raw materials used in our products could cause us to be unable to meet customer demand in a timely manner, which could result in the loss of customers and net sales or could result in a lower profit margin for us.\nJinong is supplied with approximately fifty different types of raw materials, of which weathered coal is the primary one as it is the raw material from which humic acid is extracted and applied to the manufacturing of our products. Although there are numerous weathered coal suppliers available in the market, we have been using major suppliers of weathered coal in northern China. If suppliers do not intend to supply us the raw material for any reason, or if there are any business interruptions at the suppliers and we are unable to source alternative supplies in a timely manner or on the same terms, we may not be able to meet customer demand for humic acid-based fertilizers in a timely manner or maintain our standards of quality for humic acid-based fertilizers during the transitional period, which may result in the loss of customers and net sales or we may not be able to keep our profit margin as before for our humic acid-based fertilizers.\nGufeng and Tianjuyuan are supplied with over fifty types of raw materials from a diversified pool of suppliers. Neither Gufeng nor Tianjuyuan are dependent on any single supplier for its raw materials; however, if we experience a significant increase in demand or if we need to replace any of these suppliers, we cannot be assured that the adequate supply of raw materials or a replacement supplier will be acquired in a timely manner to avoid any material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nAny significant fluctuation in our production costs may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe prices for the raw materials and other inputs to manufacture our fertilizer products are subject to market forces largely beyond our control, including the price of weathered coal, energy costs, mineral and non-mineral elements, and freight costs. The costs for these inputs may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the economy and markets. Although we may pass any increase of such costs to our customers, in the event we are unable to do so, we could incur significant losses and a diminution of our share price.\nWe do not presently maintain business disruption insurance. Any disruption of the operations in our factories would damage our business.\nOur operations could be interrupted by fire, flood, earthquake and other events beyond our control for which we do not carry adequate insurance. While we have property damage insurance and automobile insurance, we do not carry business disruption insurance, which is not readily available in China. Any disruption of the operations in our factories would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture and deliver products, which would cause a potential diminution in sales, the cancellation of orders, damage to our reputation and potential lawsuits.\nWe do not presently maintain product liability insurance, and our property and equipment insurance does not cover the full value of our property and equipment, which leaves us with exposure in the event of loss or damage to our properties or claims filed against us.\nWe currently do not carry any product liability or other similar insurance. We cannot assure that we would not face liability in the event of the failure of any of our products. We also cannot assure you that, especially as Chinas domestic consumer economy and industrial economy continues to expand, product liability exposure and litigation will not become more commonplace in the PRC, or that we will not face product liability exposure or actual liability as we expand our sales into international markets where product liability claims could be more prevalent.\nThe occurrence of any acts of God, war, terrorist attacks and other emergencies which are beyond our control may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nActs of God, war, terrorist attacks and other emergencies which are beyond our control may have a material adverse effect on the economy and infrastructure in the PRC and on the livelihood of the Chinese population. Our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected should such events occur. We cannot give assurance that any acts of God such as floods, earthquakes, drought or any war, terrorist attack or other hostilities in any part of the PRC or even the world, potential or threatened, will not, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we cannot renew our fertilizer registration certificates, we will be unable to sell some or all our products. If we do not receive the formal fertilizer registration certificates for our new products, upon the expiration of the temporary registration certificates, we cannot continue to produce such new products.\nAll fertilizers produced in China must be registered with the PRC Ministry of Agriculture. No fertilizer can be manufactured without such registration. There are two kinds of registrations: interim registration and formal registration. The interim registration is valid for one year and applies to fertilizers in the stages of in-the-field testing and test selling. Fertilizers that have completed in-the-field testing and test selling must obtain formal registration, which is valid for five years, and thereafter must be renewed each five years. Jinong has 16 formal registration certificates. Gufeng and Tianjuyuan have 19 interim fertilizer certificates and 259 formal certificates. We plan to apply for formal certificates for each of our interim certificates before the applicable expiration dates.\nOur belief is that the PRC Ministry of Agriculture generally grants an application for renewal in the absence of illegal activity by the applicant. However, there is no assurance that the PRC Ministry of Agriculture will grant renewal of our formal Fertilizer Registration Certificates. If we cannot obtain the necessary renewal, we will not be able to manufacture and sell such fertilizer products without certificates, which will cause the termination of commercial operations for such fertilizer products. With respect to the transformation of the interim fertilizer registration certificates to formal fertilizer registration certificates, we believe that we can receive formal fertilizer registration certificates for our 19 interim fertilizer registration certificates in due course; however, if the government imposes additional burden on the application procedure or put temporary suspension on its certificate granting process due to any unexpected incidents in China, we cannot assure that our formal fertilizer registration certificates can be obtained without delay or can be obtained at all, in which case our production could be adversely affected.\nWe may not possess all the licenses required to operate our business or may fail to maintain the licenses we currently hold. This could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition to a fertilizer registration certificate, we are required to hold a variety of other permits, licenses and certificates to conduct our business in China. We may not possess or receive all the permits, licenses and certificates required for our business or for which application has been made. In addition, there may be circumstances under which the approvals, permits, licenses or certificates granted by the governmental agencies are subject to change without substantial notice in advance. If we fail to obtain or to maintain such permits, licenses or certificates or renewals are granted with onerous conditions, we could be subject to fines and other penalties and be limited in the number or the quality of the products that we would be able to offer. As a result, our business, result of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nPotential environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to numerous laws, regulations, rules and specifications relating to the environment, including, among others, the Integrated Emission Standard of Air Pollutants GB 16297-1996 and the Standard of Environmental Noise of Urban Area GB 3096-93. Failure to comply with any laws and regulations and future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. Our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected if we were to be held liable for violating existing environmental regulations or if we were to incur significant expenditures to comply with environmental regulations affecting our operations.\nOur success depends on our management team and other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend, to a large extent, on the abilities and participation of our current management team, with a reliance upon Mr. Zhuoyu Li, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Zhibiao Pan, the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Li and/or Mr. Pan, for any reason, may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We do not carry key man life insurance for our key personnel.\nThe agricultural chemicals business is specialized and requires the employment of personnel with significant scientific and operational experience in the industry. Accordingly, we must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically and scientifically competent employees. Our ability to effectively implement our business strategy will depend upon, among other factors, the successful recruitment and retention of additional management and other key personnel that have the necessary scientific, technical and operational skills and experience with the fertilizer industry. These individuals are difficult to find in the PRC and we may not be able to retain such skilled employees. If we are unable to hire individuals with the requisite experience, we may not be able to produce enough products to optimize profits, and the research and development initiatives may be delayed which will negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nMr. Zhuoyu Li, our Chairman and CEO may not devote all his time to our business.\nOur Chairman and CEO, Mr. Zhuoyu Li, also serves as Chairman of Xian Techteam Science & Technology Industry (Group) Co. Ltd., a company engaged in hi-tech application fields in China, and Chairman and CEO of Xian Techteam Investment Holding (Group) Co., Ltd, a holding company for certain entities such as Gem Grain. This may give rise to further allocation of Mr. Lis time to each business. While Mr. Li anticipates having sufficient time to devote to our business, a lack of adequate time spent by him on our business may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nMr. Zhibiao Pan, our co-CEO may not devote all his time to our business.\nOur newly appointed co-CEO, Mr. Zhibiao Pan, also serves as the CEO of Poolin Group, a company engaged in blockchain and cryptocurrency business globally. This may give rise to further allocation of Mr. Pans time to the business of Poolin Group. While Mr. Pan anticipates having sufficient time to devote to our business, a lack of adequate time spent by him on our business may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to annually furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report must contain, among other matters, an assessment by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including a statement as to whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of our fiscal year. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Performing the system and process documentation and evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is both costly and challenging. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We cannot provide assurance that we will not fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment on an ongoing basis, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors.\nOur Bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against costs and expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. Consequently, we may be required to expend substantial funds to satisfy these indemnity obligations.\nOur inability to effectively improve the financial performance of Gufeng may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile Gufeng had sales revenues of $102,755,286, for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, Gufengs net income for such period was $(80,547,966). This was primarily due to the lower profit margins on Gufengs products, inefficiencies in production and daily operations and negative working capital. In addition, rising transportation costs passed on by Gufengs distributors may further erode margins on Gufengs products. As Gufeng is based in Beijing, it is susceptible to rising costs of labor common in large cities such as Beijing, which may make it difficult for us to expand the workforce of Gufeng and Tianjuyuan to meet our strategic goals.\nAlthough we have continued making progress in terms of integrating Gufengs employees, products and distribution network into our business, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue effectively to do so, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have not obtained the land use right over the premises on which certain facilities of Gufeng, our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, is located. As a result, the lack of a proper title certificate may jeopardize our right to use the premises and our possession of the buildings we built on such premises.\nThrough Tianjuyuan, we rent approximately 47,333 square meters (509,488 square feet) of land in the Ping Gu District of Beijing (the Premises). Under the rental agreement dated February 16, 2004 with the village committee of Dong Gao Village and Zhen Nan Zhang Dai Village in the Beijing Ping Gu District (the rental agreement), Tianjuyuan rents the land at an annual rent of RMB 35,500 (approximately $5,300). The term of the rental agreement is from February 1, 2004 to January 31, 2054. We were informed by our PRC counsel that the rental agreement is invalid and unenforceable pursuant to the PRC Land Administration Law and related regulations. Therefore, we have been in the process of applying for the proper land use right certificate from the relevant government authorities to legitimize our right over the Premises. As of the date of this report, we were informed by the local government that our application materials for the land use right in issue has been moved up from the department in charge of general matters to the land administrative department of the local government and is under their review. However, there can be no assurance that such land use right certificate will be granted to us. Until we obtain the land use right certificate, there is a risk that the PRC government may declare the rental agreement invalid, evict our personnel from the Premises and tear down the buildings we built on the Premises. As of the date of this Report, we have no knowledge of any pending or threatened governmental actions relating to the Premises.\nA severe or prolonged downturn in the global economy could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe global market and economic conditions during the years 2008 through 2022 were unprecedented and challenging, with recessions occurring in most major economies. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long-term and wide-spread recession, energy costs, geopolitical issues, and the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth around the world. The difficult economic outlook has negatively affected businesses and consumer confidence and contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels.\nThe PRC economy also faces challenges. The PRC government has implemented various measures recently to curb inflation. If economic growth slows or an economic downturn occurs, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in the PRC\nSubstantially all our assets and operations are in the PRC, and substantially all our revenue is sourced from the PRC. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial position are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in the PRC, including the following risks:\nChanges in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of such business.\nThe PRCs economy is in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy, subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on economic conditions in China. Our interests may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including:\n\u25cf changes in laws, regulations or their interpretation;\n\u25cf confiscatory taxation;\n\u25cf restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies and export tariff;\n\u25cf expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nAlthough the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than two decades, we cannot assure you that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in China.\nThe PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. Any changes in such PRC laws and regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe and any future subsidiaries are considered foreign persons or foreign funded enterprises under PRC laws, and we are subject to PRC laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance from foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales in the PRC and any downturn in the Chinese economy could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nSubstantially all our operations are conducted in the PRC and substantially all our revenues are generated from sales in the PRC. We anticipate that revenues from sales of our products in the PRC will continue to represent a substantial proportion of our total revenues soon. Any significant decline in the condition of the PRC economy could, among other things, adversely affect the consumption of our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nInflation in the PRC could negatively affect our profitability and growth.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced rapid growth, it has been uneven among various sectors of the economy and in different geographical areas of the country. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our products do not rise at a rate that is sufficient to fully absorb inflation-driven increases in our costs of supplies, our profitability can be adversely affected.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund or IMF, the inflation rate in China fluctuated on an annual basis from a low rate of -1.4% in 1999 to the highest rate of 5.9% in 2008. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index for December 2019, 2020 and 2021 were increases of 4.5%, 0.2% and 1.5%, respectively. These fluctuations and economic factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. To control inflation in the past, the PRC government has imposed controls on bank credits, limits on loans for fixed assets and restrictions on state bank lending. The implementation of these and other similar policies can impede economic growth and thereby harm the market for our products.\nRestrictions on investigations by overseas securities regulators.\nUnder Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator can directly conduct investigations or evidence collection activities within the PRC and no entity or individual in China may provide documents and information relating to securities business activities to overseas regulators without Chinese government approval. As a result, our shareholders may not benefit from a regulatory environment that fosters effective enforcement of U.S. and other securities laws. This could adversely affect investor and shareholder protection, and it could cause securities exchanges and overseas regulators to impose additional requirements on us.\nRecent regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review and disclosure requirements, expose us to government interference, or otherwise restrict our ability to offer securities and raise capital outside China, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nAs our operations in China increasingly involve the provision of administrative support as well as information technology services to our operating entities within China, we may be subject to PRC laws relating to, among others, data security and restrictions over foreign investments in value-added telecommunications services and other industry sectors set out in the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment (2020 Edition). Specifically, we may be subject to PRC laws relating to the collection, use, sharing, retention, security, and transfer of confidential and private information, such as personal information and other data. These PRC laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China, and other parties with which we have commercial relations. These PRC laws and their interpretations and enforcement continue to develop and are subject to change, and the PRC government may adopt other rules and restrictions in the future.\nThe recent regulatory developments in China, with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, and the government-led cybersecurity reviews of certain companies with VIE structures, may lead to additional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States.\nPursuant to the PRC Cybersecurity Law, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress on November 7, 2016 and took effect on June 1, 2017, personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure operator in the course of its operations in China must be stored in China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services that affect or may affect national security, it should be subject to cybersecurity review by the CAC. The PRC Cybersecurity Law also establishes more stringent requirements applicable to operators of computer networks, especially to operators of networks which involve critical information infrastructure. The PRC Cybersecurity Law contains an overarching framework for regulating Internet security, protection of private and sensitive information, and safeguards for national cyberspace security and provisions for the continued government regulation of the Internet and content available in China. The PRC Cybersecurity Law emphasizes requirements for network products, services, operations and information security, as well as monitoring, early detection, emergency response and reporting. Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of critical information infrastructure operator remains unclear. On July 10, 2021, the CAC publicly issued the Cybersecurity Review Measures (the Draft Measures) for public comments until July 25, 2021. According to the Draft Measures, the scope of cybersecurity reviews is extended to data processing operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. The Draft Measures further requires that any operator applying for listing on a foreign exchange must go through cybersecurity review if it possesses personal information of more than one million users. According to the Draft Measures, a cybersecurity review assesses potential national security risks that may be brought about by any procurement, data processing, or overseas listing. The review focuses on several factors, including, among others, (1) the risk of theft, leakage, corruption, illegal use or export of any core or important data, or a large amount of personal information, and (2) the risk of any critical information infrastructure, core or important data, or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled or maliciously exploited by a foreign government after a company is listed overseas. While the Draft Measures had been released for consultation purpose, there is still uncertainty regarding the Draft Measures as to its final content, its adoption timeline or effective date, its final interpretation and implementation, and other aspects. Furthermore, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC (PIPL), which will become effective from November 1, 2021, and requires general network operators to obtain a personal information protection certification issued by recognized institutions in accordance with the CAC regulation before such information can be transferred out of China.\nOn July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of the SEC issued a statement requesting additional disclosures from offshore issuers with China-based operating companies before their registration statements will be declared effective, including detailed disclosure related to VIE structures and whether the VIE and the issuer, when applicable, received or were denied permission from the PRC authorities to list on U.S. exchanges and the risks that such approval could be denied or rescinded. On August 1, 2021, the CSRC issued a statement that it had taken note of the new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory developments in China, and that the securities regulators in both countries should strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers.\nAs of the date of this report, we have taken preliminary steps to expand our business into that of blockchain applications and cryptocurrency mining in international markets. Our remaining operations in China do not involve the processing of any significant amount of personal information. However, if the enacted version of the Draft Measures mandates clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific actions to be completed by companies aiming to offer securities outside China, we cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities will not subsequently require us to undergo the approval procedures and subject us to penalties for non-compliance, or that if we are required to obtain such clearance, such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all. If we become subject to cybersecurity inspection and/or review by the CAC or other PRC authorities or are required by them to take any specific actions, it could cause suspension or termination of the future offering of our securities, disruptions to our operations, result in negative publicity regarding our company, and divert our managerial and financial resources. We may also be subject to significant fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on paying dividends and making other payments to our subsidiary, Green New Jersey; as a result, we might therefore be unable to pay dividends to you.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in the State of Nevada and do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries, Green New Jersey, Jinong, Gufeng, and the VIE company. Because of our holding company structure, we rely entirely on dividends payments from our subsidiaries in the PRC. PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits, as determined in with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC accounting standards and regulations, our subsidiaries are also required to set aside a portion of their after-tax profits to fund certain reserves. We may experience difficulties such as lengthy processing time from the foreign exchange administrative bureaus side and administrative formalities in completing the procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency. Furthermore, if any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or Green New Jersey are unable to receive any profits from the operations of our subsidiaries in the PRC, we may be unable to pay dividends to our common stockholders.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of our common stock.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi (RMB) into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. We receive substantially all our revenues in RMB, which is currently not a freely convertible currency. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends, or otherwise satisfy foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from the transaction, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate governmental authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of the PRC to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nThe PRC government also may at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay certain of our expenses as they come due.\nThe fluctuation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our common stock.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRCs political and economic conditions. As we rely entirely on revenues earned in the PRC, any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and financial condition. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from an offering of our securities into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could lead the RMB equivalent of the U.S. dollars to be reduced and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for making dividend payments on our common stock or for other business purposes and the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the RMB we convert would be reduced. In the fiscal year 2022, Chinas currency decreased by a cumulative 3.4% against the U.S. dollar on hopes of boosting the domestic economy, making Chinese exports more expensive and imports into China cheaper by that amount. The effect on trade can be substantial. In addition, the depreciation of significant U.S. dollar denominated assets could result in a charge to our income statement and a reduction in the value of these assets.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC domestic residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners to personal liability, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nSAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as SAFE Circular 75 promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 (the SAFE Notice) requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE regarding their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle (the SPV). SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under the SAFE Notice, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth above could result in liability under Chinese law for foreign exchange evasion and may result in penalties and legal sanctions, including fines, the imposition of restrictions on a Chinese subsidiarys foreign exchange activities and its ability to distribute dividends to the SPV, its ability to pay the SPV proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the Chinese subsidiary and the SPVs ability to contribute additional capital into or provide loans to the Chinese subsidiary. After consultation with China counsel, we do not believe that any of our PRC domestic resident stockholders are subject to the SAFE registration requirement. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all our stockholders who are PRC residents will not be required to make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by these SAFE regulations in the future. The failure or inability of our PRC resident stockholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth therein may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, or limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends or obtain foreign-exchange-dominated loans to our company.\nAs it is uncertain how the SAFE regulations will be interpreted or implemented, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe may be subject to fines and legal sanctions by SAFE or other PRC government authorities if we or our employees who are PRC citizens fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee stock options granted by offshore listed companies to PRC citizens.\nOn March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Operating Procedures for Foreign Exchange Administration of Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Stock Option Plans of Offshore Listed Companies, or Circular 78. Under Circular 78, Chinese citizens who are granted share options by an offshore listed company are required, through a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of the offshore listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures, including applications for foreign exchange purchase quotas and opening special bank accounts. We and our Chinese employees who have been granted share options are subject to Circular 78. Failure to comply with these regulations may subject us or our Chinese employees to fines and legal sanctions imposed by SAFE or other PRC government authorities and may prevent us from further granting options under our share incentive plans to our employees. Such events could adversely affect our business operations.\nOur business and financial performance may be materially adversely affected if the PRC regulatory authorities determine that our acquisition of Jinong constitutes a Round-trip Investment without the PRC Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) approval.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies promulgated the Regulation on Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (the 2006 M&A Rules), which became effective on September 8, 2006. According to the 2006 M&A Rules, a Round-trip Investment is defined as having taken place when a PRC business that is owned, directly or indirectly, by PRC individual(s) is sold to a non-PRC entity that is established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by those same PRC individual(s) and their PRC affiliates. Under the 2006 M&A Rules, any Round-trip Investment must be approved by the MOFCOM. The application of the 2006 M&A Rules with respect to the definition of Round-trip Investment remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing among the leading PRC law firms regarding the definition, scope of the applicability of the MOFCOM approval.\nWe, through Green New Jersey, acquired 100% of the capital stock of Jinong (the Jinong Acquisition.) Jinong is a PRC business whose stockholders were two PRC individuals and a PRC entity, of which Mr. Tao Li, our former Chairman and CEO, was the controlling stockholder, holding 31% of its shares. The PRC regulatory authorities could take the view that the Jinong Acquisition may be part of a Round-trip Investment. The PRC legal counsel of Jinong has opined that the Jinong Acquisition did not violate any PRC law, which would include the 2006 M&A Rules. We, however, cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authority, MOFCOM, will take the same view as the PRC legal counsel. If the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the Jinong Acquisition constitutes a Round-trip Investment under the 2006 M&A Rules, we cannot be assured that we may be able to obtain the approval required from MOFCOM.\nIf the PRC regulatory authorities take the view that the Jinong Acquisition constitutes a Round-trip Investment without MOFCOM approval, they could invalidate our acquisition and ownership of Jinong. Additionally, the PRC regulatory authorities may take the view that the Jinong Acquisition constitutes a transaction which requires the prior approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, before MOFCOM approval is obtained. We believe that if this takes place, we may be able to find a way to re-establish control of Jinongs business operations through a series of contractual arrangements rather than an outright purchase of Jinong. We cannot assure you that such contractual arrangements will be protected by PRC law or that we can receive as complete or effective economic benefit and overall control of Jinongs business than if the Company had direct ownership of Jinong. In addition, we cannot assure you that such contractual arrangements can be successfully affected under PRC law. If we cannot obtain MOFCOM or CSRC approval if required by the PRC regulatory authorities to do so, and if we cannot put in place or enforce relevant contractual arrangements as an alternative and equivalent means of control of Jinong, our corporate structure could be materially adversely affected.\nJinongs contractual arrangements with Yuxing may result in adverse tax consequences to us.\nWe could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that Jinongs contractual arrangements with Yuxing were not made on an arms length basis and adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could result in a reduction, for PRC tax purposes, of adjustments recorded by Yuxing, which could adversely affect us by increasing Yuxings tax liability without reducing Jinongs tax liability, which could further result in late payment fees and other penalties to Yuxing for underpaid taxes.\nWe control Yuxing through contractual arrangements which may not be as effective in providing control over Yuxing as direct ownership, and if Yuxing or its shareholders breach the contractual arrangements, we would have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, which may not be available or effective, to enforce or protect our rights.\nEffective June 16, 2013, we conduct substantially all our operations on agriculture products, and generate substantially all our revenues from agriculture products, through contractual arrangements with our VIE, Yuxing, that provide us, through our ownership of Green New Jersey and its ownership of Jinong, with effective control over Yuxing. We have no direct ownership interest in Yuxing. We depend on Yuxing to hold and maintain agriculture products contracts with our customers. Yuxing also owns substantially all our property, facilities and other assets relating to the operation of our agriculture products business and employs the personnel for substantially all our agriculture products business. Neither we nor Jinong has any direct ownership interest in Yuxing. Although we believe that that each contract under Jinongs contractual arrangements with Yuxing is valid, binding and enforceable under current PRC laws and regulations in effect, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Yuxing as direct ownership of Yuxing would be. In addition, Yuxing may breach the contractual arrangements. For example, Yuxing may decide not to make contractual payments to Jinong, and consequently to us, in accordance with the existing contractual arrangements. In the event of any such breach, we would have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be available or effective, particularly considering uncertainties in the PRC legal system.\nYuxing may also seek to renew its agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with substantial ability to control Yuxing, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. If we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire or enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.\nIn addition, although we do not rely on Yuxings revenue, Yuxings VIE structure is subject to uncertainty amid the PRCs changing legislative practice. In January 2015, Chinas Ministry of Commerce unveiled draft legislation that could change how the government regulates corporate structures, especially for VIEs controlled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at ownership, the draft law focuses on the entities or individuals who control a VIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled by foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a negative list, where only companies controlled by Chinese nationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs.\nIf the draft law is implemented in any form, and the Companys business is characterized as one of the restricted or prohibited sectors, Yuxing may be barred from operation, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nPRC laws and regulations governing our businesses and the validity of certain of our contractual arrangements are uncertain. If we are found to be in violation of such PRC laws and regulations, we could be subject to sanctions. In addition, changes in such PRC laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of Yuxings contractual arrangements with Jinong. Jinong is considered a foreign invested enterprise under PRC law. As a result, Jinong is subject to PRC law limitations on its businesses and foreign ownership of Chinese companies. These laws and regulations are relatively new and may be subject to change, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively.\nThe PRC government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. Licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked later by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PRC environmental laws and regulations may adversely impact on our business.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to numerous environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. These laws, ordinances and regulations address and regulate, among other matters, wastewater discharge, air quality and the generation, handling, storage, treatment, disposal and transportation of solid and hazardous waste. It is possible that compliance with a new regulatory requirement could impose significant compliance costs on us. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased global focus on environmental and social issues could result in the adoption of more stringent standards in these areas by the PRC.\nWe believe that we have obtained all permits, licenses and approvals, and filed all registrations required for the conduct of our business, except where the failure to obtain such permit, license or approval, or file any registration would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have not been notified by any governmental authority of any continuing noncompliance, liability or other claim relating to any of our properties or business operations, nor are we aware of any other material environmental condition with respect to any of our properties or arising out of our business operations at any other location.\nHowever, no assurance can be given that all potential environmental liabilities have been identified or properly quantified or that any prior owner, operator, or tenant has not created an environmental condition unknown to us. Moreover, no assurance can be given that (i) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or (ii) the current environmental condition of the properties will not be affected by the condition of land or operations near the properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us.\nPRC regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds we receive from any offerings to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or to make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nWe are a holding company in the United States conducting our operations in China through our PRC subsidiaries. In utilizing the proceeds, we may receive from any offerings, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, whether currently in existence or to be formed in the future, or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries.\nAny loans we make to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE, or its local counterparts. Under applicable PRC law, the government authorities must approve a foreign-invested enterprises registered capital amount, which represents the total amount of capital contributions made by the stockholders that have registered with the registration authorities. In addition, the authorities must also approve the foreign-invested enterprises total investment, which is equal to the companys registered capital plus the amount of stockholder loans it is permitted to borrow under the law. The ratio of registered capital to total investment cannot be lower than the minimum statutory requirement. If we make loans to our operating subsidiaries in China that do not exceed the current maximum amount of borrowings, we will have to register each loan with SAFE or its local counterpart for the issuance of a registration certificate of foreign debts. In practice, it could be time-consuming to complete such SAFE registration process. Alternatively, or concurrently with the loans, we might make capital contributions to our operating subsidiaries in China and such capital contributions involve uncertainties of their own. Further, SAFE promulgated a new circular (known as Circular 142) in August 2008 with respect to the administration of conversion of foreign exchange capital contributions of a foreign-invested enterprise. The circular clarifies that RMB converted from foreign exchange capital contributions can only be used for the activities within the approved business scope of such foreign-invested enterprise and cannot be used for domestic equity investments unless otherwise permitted.\nWhile we do not foresee this to happen soon, with respect to future loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries, we cannot be assured that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, when the need arises. If circumstances call and if we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we receive from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely and materially affect our ability to fund and expand our business.\nThe PRC government has significant influence over companies with China-based operations by enforcing existing rules and regulation, adopting new ones, or changing relevant industrial policies in a manner that may materially increase our compliance cost, change the relevant industry landscape or otherwise cause significant changes to our remaining business operations in China, which could result in material and adverse changes in our operations and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nThe PRC government has significant influence over China-based operations of any company by allocating resources, providing preferential treatment to industries or companies, or imposing industry-wide policies on certain industries. The PRC government may also amend or enforce existing rules and regulation, or adopt ones, which could materially increase our compliance cost, change the relevant industry landscape, or cause significant changes to our business operations in China. In addition, the PRC regulatory system is based in part on government policies and internal guidance, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and some of which may even have a retroactive effect. We may not be always aware of all non-compliance incidents, and may face regulatory investigation, fines, and other penalties as a result. As a result of the changes in the industrial policies of the PRC government, including the amendment to and/or enforcement of the related laws and regulations, companies with China-based operations face significant compliance and operational risks and uncertainties. For example, on July 24, 2021, Chinese state media, including Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television, announced a broad set of reforms targeting private education companies providing after-school tutoring services and prohibiting foreign investments in institutions providing such after-school tutoring services. As a result, the market value of certain U.S. listed companies with China-based operations in the affected sectors declined substantially. On August 30, 2021, the PRC government-imposed restrictions over the provision of online gaming services to minors, aiming at curbing excessive indulgence in online gaming and protecting minors mental and physical health, which could adversely affect the development of the online gaming industry in China. The PRC government has also imposed severe restrictions over the operations of cryptocurrency business, which changed the entire industry landscape in China. In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission of China may classify cryptocurrency mining operations as an industry to be eliminated. We have adopted a development strategy to focus on the development and expansion of our blockchain and cryptocurrency mining operations into international markets. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any similar regulations that may be adopted to significantly curtail our existing business operations in China. However, if such other adverse regulations or policies are adopted in China, our existing operations in China will be materially and adversely affected, and we may have to relocate our offices and certain assets to international markets outside China, which may significantly disrupt our international operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to be deemed as a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we could be subject to tax on our global income at the rate of 25% under the Enterprise Income Tax Law (2008 EIT Law) in the PRC and our non-PRC shareholders could be subject to certain PRC taxes.\nUnder the 2008 EIT Law and the implementing rules, both of which became effective January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with de facto management bodies within the PRC may be considered a PRC resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. The implementing rules of the 2008 EIT Law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise. If we were to be considered a resident enterprise by the PRC tax authorities, our global income would be taxable under the 2008 EIT Law at the rate of 25% and, to the extent we were to generate a substantial amount of income outside of PRC in the future, we would be subject to additional taxes. In addition, the dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and gains derived by such shareholders from the transfer of our shares may also be subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate up to 10%, if such income were regarded as China-sourced income. In addition, the circular mentioned above details that certain Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese group enterprises will be classified as resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in China: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, company seal, and minutes of board meetings and stockholders meetings; and half or more of the directors with voting rights or senior management. However, as of the date hereof, no final interpretation on the implementation of the resident enterprise designation is available. Moreover, any such designation, when made by PRC tax authorities, will be determined based on the facts and circumstances of individual cases. As a result, we cannot determine the likelihood or consequences of our being designated a resident enterprise as of the date hereof.\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise, we may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide income and dividends paid by us to our non-PRC stockholders as well as capital gains recognized by them with respect to the sale of our stock may be subject to a PRC withholding tax. This will have an impact on our effective tax rate, a material adverse effect on our net income and results of operations, and it may require us to withhold tax on our non-PRC stockholders.\nBecause our principal assets are located outside of the United States and because almost all our directors and officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to use the United States Federal securities laws to enforce your rights against us and our officers and most of our directors or to enforce judgments of United States courts against us or most of our directors and officers in the PRC.\nAlmost all our present officers and directors reside outside of the United States; accordingly, it may be difficult to serve them with process in case of a legal action against them. In addition, our operating subsidiaries are in the PRC and substantially all their assets are located outside of the United States. It may therefore be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights based on the civil liability provisions of the United States Federal securities laws against us or our officers and directors in the courts of either the United States or the PRC and, even if civil judgments are obtained in courts of the United States, to enforce such judgments in PRC courts. It is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and the PRC would permit effective enforcement against us or most of our directors and officers of criminal penalties, under the United States Federal securities laws or otherwise. In addition, enforcement of a foreign judgment in the PRC may be limited or otherwise affected by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, arrangement, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and will be subject to a statutory limitation of time within which proceedings may be brought.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices may occur in the PRC. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business, which would put us at a disadvantage. We can make no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty managing the risk associated with doing business in the Chinese fertilizer and agricultural products sectors.\nIn general, the fertilizer and agricultural products sectors in China are affected by a series of factors, including, but not limited to, natural, economic and social such as climate, market, technology, regulation, and globalization, which makes risk management difficult. Fertilizer and agricultural products operations in China face similar risks as present in other countries; however, in the PRC these can either be mitigated or exacerbated due to governmental intervention through policy promulgation and implementation either in the fertilizer and agricultural products or sectors which provide critical inputs to fertilizer and agricultural products such as energy or outputs such as transportation. While not an exhaustive list, the following factors could significantly affect our ability to do business:\n\u25cf food, feed, and energy demand including liquid fuels and crude oil;\n\u25cf agricultural, financial, energy and renewable energy and trade policies;\n\u25cf input and output pricing due to market factors and regulatory policies;\n\u25cf production and crop progress due to adverse weather conditions, equipment deliveries, and water and irrigation conditions; and\n\u25cf infrastructure conditions and policies.\nCurrently, we do not hold and do not intend to purchase insurance policies to protect revenue in the case that the above conditions cause losses of revenue.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Stock.\nWe may not pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe paid a cash dividend on January 30, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of October 31, 2014. However, we may not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay, or may be unable to pay, any dividends. At present we intend to retain all earnings for our companys operations.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, which may adversely affect the price at which you can sell our shares.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operations results;\n\u25cf filing of a class action lawsuit against us and certain of our current and former officers;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u25cf conditions in foreign or domestic fertilizer and agricultural markets;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies in the same industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf intellectual property litigation;\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the PRC; and\n\u25cf Other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain required additional financing when needed.\nWe may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to fund future capital expenditures. Additional equity may result in dilution to the holders of our outstanding shares of capital stock. Additional debt financing may include conditions that would restrict our freedom to operate our business, such as conditions that:\n\u25cf limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consent for the payment of dividends;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nA SEC investor bulletin regarding reverse mergers may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nOn June 9, 2011, the SEC issued an investor bulletin in which it explained the process by which a company becomes a public company by means of a reverse merger, described the potential risks of investing in a reverse merger company and detailed recent enforcement actions taken by it against certain reverse merger companies. The investor bulletin raised specific concerns with respect to foreign companies that access the U.S. markets through the reverse merger process, as we did. The SEC investor bulletin could lead investors in our common stock to sell their shares and may cause other investors not to invest in us, thus driving down the market price of our common stock or making it more difficult for us to raise funds in the future.\nStockholders should have no expectation of any dividends in the future.\nWe paid a cash dividend on January 30, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of October 31, 2014. However, the Board of Directors may not intend to declare any dividends on our common stock soon, but instead currently intends to retain all earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we decide to pay dividends, foreign exchange and other regulations in China may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from China or convert those payments from Renminbi into foreign currencies.\nIf our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with the New York Stock Exchange, it may be subject to the so-called penny stock rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2.

On December 11, 2009, our stockholders approved the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan gives us the ability to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other stock-based awards to our employees, consultants and to non-employee members of our advisory board or our Board or the board of directors of any of our subsidiaries. On October 3, 2012, October 25, 2013 and May 15, 2015, our Board approved the amendment to increase the shares covered by the Incentive Plan by three million shares. On April 23, 2019, our Board approved the fourth amendment to increase the shares covered by the Incentive Plan by 3.9 million shares and an extension of the Plan for an additional ten years. All four amendments were approved by our stockholders on the annual meetings held on December 15, 2012, December 22, 2013, June 30, 2015, and June 22, 2019, respectively. As a result, a total of 3.9 million shares of Common Stock have been reserved under the Incentive Plan.\nAs of June 30, 2022, there was no outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock granted under the Plan.

Our primary business is fertilizer products, specifically humic-acid based compound fertilizer produced by Jinong and compound fertilizer, blended fertilizer, organic compound fertilizer, slow-release fertilizer, highly concentrated water-soluble fertilizer, and mixed organic-inorganic compound fertilizer produced by Gufeng. In addition, through Yuxing, we develop and produce various agricultural products, such as top-grade fruits, vegetables, flowers and colored seedlings. For financial reporting purposes, our operations are organized into three business segments: fertilizer products (Jinong), fertilizer products (Gufeng) and agricultural products (Yuxing).\nThe fertilizer business conducted by Jinong and Gufeng generated approximately 86.4% and 71.0% of our total revenues for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In return, the shareholders of Fengnong agreed to pay cash with amount of RMB8,750,000 (approximately $1,306,375) to the Company.\nPursuant to the SAA and the ACN, the shareholders of the Targets, while retaining possession of the equity interests and continuing to be the legal owners of such interests, agreed to pledge and entrust all of their equity interests, including the proceeds thereof but excluding any claims or encumbrances, and the operations and management of its business to Jinong, in exchange of an aggregate amount of RMB45,000,000 (approximately $6,718,500) to be paid by Jinong within three days following the execution of the SAA, ACN and the VIE Agreements, and convertible notes with an aggregate face value of RMB 63,000,000 (approximately $9,405,900) with an annual fixed compound interest rate of 3% and term of three years.\nJinong acquired the Targets using the VIE arrangement based on our need to further develop our business and comply with the regulatory requirements under the PRC laws.\nAs our business focuses on the production of fertilizer, all our business activities intertwine with those in the agriculture industry in China. Specifically, we deal with compliance, regulation, safety, inspection, and licenses in fertilizer production, farmland use and transfer, growing and distribution of agriculture goods, agriculture basic supplies, seeds, pesticides, and trades of grains. It is an industry in which heavy regulations get implemented and strictly enforced. In addition, E-commerce, which is also under strict government regulation in the PRC, has lately become a sales and distribution channel for agricultural products. Currently, we are developing an online platform to connect the physical distribution network we either own or lease.\nCompared with the regulatory environment in other jurisdictions, the regulatory environment in the PRC is unique. For example, the M&A Rules purports to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals and formed for purposes of overseas listing through acquisition of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC) prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicles securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles.\nFor both e-commerce and agriculture industries, PRC regulators limit the investment from foreign entities and set particularly rules for foreign-owned entities to conduct business. We expect these limitations on foreign-owned entities will continue to exist in e-commerce and agriculture industries. The VIE arrangement, however, provides feasibility for obtaining administrative approval process and avoiding industry restrictions that can be imposed on an entity that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign entity. The VIE agreements reduce uncertainty and the current limitation risk. It is our understanding that the VIE agreements, as well as the control we obtained through VIE arrangement, are valid and enforceable. Such legal structure does not violate the known, published, and current PRC laws. While there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that the PRC authorities will take a view that is not contrary to or otherwise different from our belief and understanding stated above, we believe the substantial difficulty that we experienced previously to conduct business in agriculture as a foreign ownership can be greatly reduced by the VIE arrangement. Further, as an integral part of the VIE arrangement, the underlying equity pledge agreements provide legal protection for the control we obtained. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements, we have completed the equity pledge processes with the Targets to ensure the complete control of the interests in the Targets. The shareholders of the Targets are not entitled to transfer any shares to a third party under the exclusive option agreements. If necessary, they may transfer shares to our company without consideration.\nWhile the VIE arrangement provides us with the feasibility to conduct our business in the E-Commerce and agriculture industries, validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is subject to (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, (ii) possible judicial or administrative actions or any PRC Laws affecting creditors rights, (iii) certain equitable, legal or statutory principles affecting the validity and enforceability of contractual rights generally under concepts of public interest, interests of the State, national security, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and applicable statutes of limitation; (iv) any circumstance in connection with formulation, execution or implementation of any legal documents that would be deemed materially mistaken, clearly unconscionable, fraudulent, coercive at the conclusions thereof; and (v) judicial discretion with respect to the availability of indemnifications, remedies or defenses, the calculation of damages, the entitlement to attorneys fees and other costs, and the waiver of immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from legal process. Validity and enforceability of VIE arrangement is also subject to risk derived from the discretion of any competent PRC legislative, administrative or judicial bodies in exercising their authority in the PRC. As a result, there can no assurance that any of such PRC Laws will not be changed, amended or replaced in the immediate future or in the longer term with or without retrospective effect.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year ended June 30, 2022 Compared to the Year ended June 30, 2021.\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30\nChange\n$ Change\n%\nSales\nJinong $ 54,339,228 $ 59,409,169 (5,069,941 ) -8.5 %\nGufeng 102,755,286 110,834,918 (8,079,632 ) -7.3 %\nYuxing 11,356,390 11,038,666 317,724 2.9 %\nNet sales 168,450,904 181,282,753 (12,831,849 ) -7.1 %\nCost of goods sold\nJinong 39,651,439 43,566,629 (3,915,190 ) -9.0 %\nGufeng 90,065,842 96,860,527 (6,794,685 ) -7.0 %\nYuxing 9,527,341 8,991,518 535,823 6.0 %\nCost of goods sold 139,244,622 149,418,674 (10,174,052 ) -6.8 %\nGross profit 29,206,282 31,864,079 (2,657,797 ) -8.3 %\nOperating expenses\nSelling expenses 11,195,153 12,968,729 (1,773,576 ) -13.7 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 101,809,233 141,187,368 (39,378,135 ) -27.9 %\nTotal operating expenses 113,004,386 154,156,097 (41,151,711 ) -26.7 %\nIncome from operations (83,798,104 ) (122,292,018 ) 38,493,914 -31.5 %\nOther income (expense)\nOther income (expense) 2,046,137 438,121 1,608,016 367.0 %\nInterest income 194,228 105,944 88,284 83.3 %\nInterest expense (256,785 ) (266,304 ) 9,519 -3.6 %\nTotal other income (expense) 1,983,580 277,761 1,705,819 614.1 %\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes (81,814,524 ) (122,014,257 ) 40,199,733 -32.9 %\nProvision for income taxes (1,291,828 ) 2,979,552 (4,271,380 ) -143.4 %\n(Loss) from continuing operations (80,522,696 ) (124,993,809 ) 44,471,113 -35.6 %\nNet (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of taxes (17,841,636 ) 5,246,192 (23,087,828 ) -440.1 %\nNet (Loss) (98,364,332 ) (119,747,617 ) 21,383,285 -17.9 %\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nForeign currency translation gain (loss) (8,832,901 ) 29,682,548 ) (38,515,449 ) -129.8 %\nComprehensive income (loss) $ (107,197,233 ) $ (90,065,069 ) (17,132,164 ) 19.0 %\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 9,348,100 6,847,732 2,500,368 36.5 %\nBasic net (loss) per share - from continuing operations (8.61 ) (18.25 ) 9.64 -52.8 %\nBasic net (loss) per share - from discontinued operations (1.91 ) 0.77 (2.67 ) -349.1 %\nBasic net (loss) per share $ (10.52 ) $ (17.49 ) 6.96 39.8 %\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 9,348,100 6,847,732 2,500,368 36.5 %\nDiluted net (loss) per share-from continuing operations (8.61 ) (18.25 ) 9.64 -52.8 %\nDiluted net (loss) earnings per share-from discontinued operations (1.91 ) 0.77 (2.67 ) -349.1 %\nDiluted net (loss) per share $ (10.52 ) $ (17.49 ) 6.96 -39.8 %\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 were $168,450,904, a decrease of $12,831,849 or 7.1%, from $181,282,753 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

Each of the segments has its own annual budget about development, production and sales.\nEach of the three operating segments referenced above has separate and distinct general ledgers. The chief operating decision maker (CODM) makes decisions with respect to resources allocation and performance assessment upon receiving financial information, including revenue, gross margin, operating income and net income produced from the various general ledger systems; however, net income by segment is the principal benchmark to measure profit or loss adopted by the CODM.\nFor Jinong, net loss decreased 85.0%, by $17,419,136 to $(3,063,634) for the year ended June 30, 2022, from $(20,482,770) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

We believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow from operations to support our business growth for the next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions or expansions. However, if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected, we may be required to seek additional capital and/or to reduce certain discretionary spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous, which may include additional debt and/or equity financings. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (19,948,216 ) $ (12,879,517 )\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 7,131,374 (476,180 )\nNet cash provided by financing activities 54,454,275 14,302,100\nEffect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents (2,461,073 ) 5,712,763\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 39,176,360 6,659,166\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning balance 18,593,944 11,934,778\nCash and cash equivalents, ending balance $ 57,770,303 $ 18,593,944\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $19,948,216 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $7,068,699, or 54.9% from cash provided by operating activities of $12,879,517 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

The increase was mainly due to the proceeds from the sale of common stock with total amount of $54,017,145, compared to $14,000,000 of proceeds from the sale of common stock for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nAs of June 30, our loans payable was as follows:\nShort term loans payable: $ 4,031,100 $ 4,179,600\nTotal $ 4,031,100 $ 4,179,600\nAccounts Receivable\nWe had accounts receivable of $28,792,891 as of June 30, 2022, as compared to $67,422,866 as of June 30, 2021, a decrease of $38,629,975 or 57.3%.

And the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable was 66.8% as of June 30, 2022 and 29.2% as of June 30, 2021. The impact of COVID-19 caused the difficulty of accounts receivable collection, resulting in higher allowance for doubtful accounts of the company.\nDeferred Assets\nWe had no deferred assets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. During the twelve months, we assisted the distributors in certain marketing efforts and developing standard stores to expand our competitive advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts and store development will be expensed over three years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the amount owed by the distributor is payable to us immediately. The deferred assets had been fully amortized as of June 30, 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the Company to use the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the assets and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forward. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met.\nInventories\nWe had inventories of $42,198,186 as of June 30, 2022, compared to $57,634,145 as of June 30, 2021, a decrease of $15,435,959, or 26.8%. The principal reason for the decrease is due to the decrease of Gufengs inventory. As of June 30, 2022, Gufengs inventory was $19,463,691, compared to $36,617,573 as of June 30, 2021, a decrease of $17,153,882, or 46.8%.\nAdvances to Suppliers\nWe had advances to suppliers of $20,711,891 as of June 30, 2022, comparing to $23,607,209 as of June 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $2,895,318, or 12.3%. Our inventory level may fluctuate from time to time, depending how fast the raw material is consumed and replenished during the production process, and how fast the finished goods are sold. The replenishment of raw material relies on the managements estimate of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the raw materials future price, and spot price along with their volatility, as well as the seasonal demand and future price of finished fertilizer products. Such estimate may not be accurate, and the purchase decision of raw materials based on the estimate can cause excessive inventories in slow sales and insufficient inventories in peak times.\nAccounts Payable\nWe had accounts payable of $1,670,655 as of June 30, 2022 as compared to $2,132,530 as of June 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $461,875, or 21.7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower accounts payable for Gufeng. It has account payable of $448,167 as of June 30, 2022, comparing to $783,119 as of June 30, 2021, representing a decrease of $334,952, or 42.8%.\nUnearned Revenue (Customer Deposit)\nWe had unearned revenue of $7,994,669 as of June 30, 2022, comparing to $6,090,156 as of June 30, 2021, representing an increase of $1,904,513, or 31.3%. The increase was mainly attributable to Jinongs $3,539,323 unearned revenue as of June 30, 2022, comparing to $1,135,988 unearned revenue as of June 30, 2021, representing an increase of $2,403,335, or 211.6%, caused by the advancement of deposits made by client. We expect to deliver products to our customers during the next three months at which time we will recognize the revenue.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the following paragraphs reflect the most critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations:\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19.\nRevenue recognition\nSales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.\nOur revenue consists of invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (VAT). No product return or sales discount allowance is made as products delivered and accepted by customers are normally not returnable and sales discounts are normally not granted after products are delivered.\nCash and cash equivalents\nFor statement of cash flows purposes, we consider all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.\nAccounts receivable\nOur policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Any accounts receivable of Jinong and Gufeng that are outstanding for more than 180 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts, and any accounts receivable of Yuxing that are outstanding for more than 90 days will be accounted as allowance for bad debts.\nAssets held for sale\nAssets held for sale represent certain equipment from our Jintai facility that has been relocated. The carrying amount of the assets held for sale equals the fair value of the assets less disposal costs. These assets were sold prior to June 30, 2022.\nDeferred assets\nDeferred assets represent amounts the Company advanced to the distributors in their marketing and stores development to expand our competitive advantage and market shares. Based on the distributor agreements, the amount owed by the distributors in certain marketing efforts and store development will be expensed over three years if the distributors are actively selling our products. If a distributor defaults, breaches, or terminates the agreement with us earlier than the realization of the contractual terms, the unamortized portion of the amount owed by the distributor is to be refunded to us immediately. The deferred assets had been fully amortized as of June 30, 2022.\nSegment reporting\nFASB ASC 280 requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a companys management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other way management disaggregates a company.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we were organized into three main business units: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), and Yuxing (agricultural products production). For financial reporting purpose, our operations were organized into three main business segments based on locations and products: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production), and Yuxing (agricultural products production). Each of the segments has its own annual budget regarding development, production, and sales. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nDisclosures about Market Risk\nWe may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business. Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur because of movements in interest rates and equity prices. We currently do not, in the normal course of business, use financial instruments that are subject to changes in financial market conditions.\nCurrency Fluctuations and Foreign Currency Risk\nSubstantially all our revenues and expenses are denominated in RMB. However, we use the U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes. Conversion of RMB into foreign currencies is regulated by the Peoples Bank of China through a unified floating exchange rate system. Although the PRC government has stated its intention to support the value of RMB, there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that RMB will not devalue significantly against U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value, in U.S. dollar terms, of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the PRC.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Except for U.S. holding companies, all our consolidated revenues, consolidated costs and expenses, and our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates, and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. As of June 30, 2022, our accumulated other comprehensive loss was $13.4 million. We have not entered any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk. The value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRCs political and economic conditions. Between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022, Chinas currency decreased by a cumulative 3.4% against the U.S. dollar, making Chinese exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive by that percentage. The effect on trade can be substantial. Moreover, it is possible that, in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe deposit surplus funds with Chinese banks earning daily interest. We do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes. All our outstanding debt instruments carry fixed rates of interests. The amount of short-term debt outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 was $4.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short-term bank loans. Although the interest rates, which are based on the banks prime rates with respect to our short-term loans, are fixed for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically three to twelve months for short-term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal. There were no material changes in interest rates for short-term bank loans renewed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The original loan term on average is one year, and the remaining average life of the short term-loans is one year.\nManagement monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not entered any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk.\nCredit Risk\nWe have experienced higher credit risk than usual since 2020. With the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the overdue outstanding accounts receivable increased significantly compared with the years prior to the pandemic. Our accounts receivables are typically unsecured and are mainly derived from revenues earned from customers in the PRC. Most of our customers are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized. They may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. Many of the SMEs that we work with cannot weather COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or they cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak. Numerous distributors encountered significant difficulties and/or hardships in their businesses amid the pandemic. Even through our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers, the bad debts expenses are higher in recent 2 years comparing with the years before 2020.\nInflation Risk\nInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Notwithstanding the measures taken by the PRC government to control inflation, China still experienced an increase in inflation and our operating cost became higher than anticipated. The high rate of inflation had an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.\nRisk of epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, and credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us. We share most of these risks with all businesses.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 may cause a global recession, which would have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations, and this impact could exist for an extensive period.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Companys operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Companys control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.\nAdditional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Companys products and services; the Companys supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Companys ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Companys profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Companys business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described above. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nBalance sheets, as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, together with the related notes and the reports of our independent registered public accounting firms, are set forth on the F pages of this report. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nPursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), at the conclusion of the period ended March 31, 2022 we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and adequately designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that allowed for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAny system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected in a timely manner. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Therefore, any current evaluation of controls cannot and should not be projected to future periods.\nManagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of the year ended June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (COSO) in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a companys internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication, and (v) monitoring.\nBased on managements assessment using the COSO criteria, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe are not required to have our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 audited by our auditors because we are a smaller reporting company.\nChanges in internal controls\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(the Company) as of June 30, 2022, and 2021, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nEmphasis of a Matter\nAs discussed in Note 20 to the financial statements, the Companys financial statements have been presented with its former 4 VIEs Lishijie, Fengnong, Jinyangguang and Wangtian as a discontinued operation.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. As described in Note 3 to the financial statements, The Company has incurred operating losses and has negative operating cash flows in the fiscal year 2022. These factors, among others, raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLand Use Rights and Trademarks Subject to Amortization - Impairment Assessment\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has intangible assets subject to amortization including Land Use Rights and Trademarks. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of Land Use Rights and Trademarks is $14,935,488. The Company performed the impairment assessment of these Intangible assets subject to amortization on its elected assessment date of June 30, 2022, by assessing the recoverability and whether the assets carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The determination of the fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting units expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, market multiples, the discount rate, operating income before depreciation and amortization, cashflows and capital expenditures forecasts.\nWe identified the impairment testing of these intangible assets subject to amortization as a critical audit matter because of significant estimates and assumptions made by the management for the assessment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\n\u25cf We tested managements process for developing the fair value of the intangible assets subject to amortization.\n\u25cf We evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to managements forecast.\n\u25cf We evaluated the reasonableness of the qualitative adjustments for factors such as Company-specific risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be captured in the quantitatively derived results, and other relevant factors.\n\u25cf We tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used by management.\n\u25cf We evaluated the reasonableness and consistency of the selected valuation methodology and assumptions utilized by the Company.\n\u25cf We tested the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the fair value estimate.\n\u25cf We evaluated the significant assumptions provided by management including discount rate by considering (i) current and past performance of the entity; (ii) their consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/ SS Accounting & Auditing, Inc.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020\nPlano, Texas\nNovember 10, 2022\nPCAOB Firm ID: 6717\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF June 30, 2022, and 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 57,770,303 $ 18,340,378\nAccounts receivable, net 28,792,891 67,422,866\nInventories, net 42,198,186 57,634,145\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4,285,198 7,616,115\nAmount due from related parties 13,064 42,757\nAdvances to suppliers, net 20,711,891 23,607,209\nCurrent Assets of discontinued VIEs -\n43,050,718\nTotal Current Assets 153,771,533 217,714,188\nPlant, property and equipment, net 18,870,152 22,082,354\nOther assets 10,600 497,365\nOther non-current assets 7,527,422 9,888,518\nIntangible assets, net 14,935,488 15,734,438\nGoodwill -\n-\nNoncurrent assets of discontinued VIEs -\n811,875\nTotal Assets $ 195,115,195 $ 266,728,738\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 1,670,655 $ 2,132,530\nCustomer deposits 7,994,669 6,090,156\nAccrued expenses and other payables 13,734,764 12,855,251\nAmount due to related parties 5,192,496 4,976,689\nTaxes payable 26,954,838 26,991,503\nShort term loans 4,031,100 4,179,600\nInterest payable 765,909 794,124\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued VIEs -\n21,198,032\nTotal Current Liabilities 60,344,431 79,217,885\nTotal Liabilities $ 60,344,431 $ 79,217,885\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders Equity\nPreferred Stock, $.001 par value, 20,000,000 shares authorized, 0 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively -\n-\nCommon stock, $.001 par value, 115,197,165 shares authorized, 12,141,467 and 8,487,629 shares issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively 12,141 8,488\nAdditional paid-in capital 224,676,686 170,223,195\nStatutory reserve 26,870,968 27,673,245\nRetained earnings (103,374,589 ) (5,812,533 )\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (13,414,442 ) (4,581,541 )\nTotal Stockholders Equity 134,770,764 187,510,853\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders Equity $ 195,115,195 $ 266,728,738\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nThe Companys current corporate structure as of is set forth in the diagram below:\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nNOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciple of consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Green New Jersey, Jinong, Gufeng, Tianjuyuan, and the VIE Company. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFor purposes of comparability, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The Companys consolidated financial statements have been presented with its former VIEs, Lishijie, Jinyangguang, Wangtian and Fengnong as a discontinued operation. See Note 21, Discontinued Operations, for more information.\nEffective June 16, 2013, Yuxing was converted from being a wholly owned foreign enterprise 100% owned by Jinong to a domestic enterprise 100% owned one natural person, who is not affiliated to the Company (Yuxings Owner). Effective the same day, Yuxings Owner entered into a series of contractual agreements with Jinong pursuant to which Yuxing became the VIE of Jinong.\nVIE assessment\nA VIE is an entity (1) that has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other entities, (2) where the group of equity holders does not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, or the obligation to absorb the entitys expected losses or the right to receive the entitys expected residual returns, or both, or (3) where the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or both, and substantially all of the entitys activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. In order to determine if an entity is considered a VIE, the Company first performs a qualitative analysis, which requires certain subjective decisions regarding its assessments, including, but not limited to, the design of the entity, the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along to its interest holders, the rights of the parties, and the purpose of the arrangement. If the Company cannot conclude after a qualitative analysis whether an entity is a VIE, it performs a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis considered the design of the entity, the risks that cause variability, the purpose for which the entity was created, and the variability that the entity was designed to pass along to its variable interest holders. When the primary beneficiary could not be identified through a qualitative analysis, we used internal cash flow models to compute and allocate expected losses or expected residual returns to each variable interest holder based upon the relative contractual rights and preferences of each interest holder in the VIEs capital structure.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of a novel strain of the COVID-19.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the implicit rate is typically not readily determinable in the Companys lease agreements, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Companys specific rate of interest to borrow on a collateralized basis, over a similar term and in a similar economic environment as the lease. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its identified asset classes. As of June 30, 2022, the Company does not have any material leases for the implementation of ASC 842.\nCash and cash equivalents and concentration of cash\nFor statement of cash flows purposes, the Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit with state owned banks in the PRC and banks in the United States, and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains large sums of cash in three major banks in China. The aggregate cash in such accounts and on hand as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 was $57,714,868 and $18,262,263, respectively. There is no insurance securing these deposits in China. In addition, the Company also had $55,435 and $78,115 in cash in two banks in the United States as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash overdraft as of balance sheet date will be reflected as liabilities in the balance sheet. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash in bank accounts.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nAccounts receivable\nManagement regularly reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable at each year-end. Accounts considered uncollectible are provisioned for written off based upon managements assessment. As of June 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had accounts receivable of $28,792,891 and $67,422,866, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $58,000,266 and $19,720,287, respectively. The impact of COVID-19 caused the difficulty of accounts receivable collection in the fiscal year 2022 as numerous distributors encountered significant difficulties and/or hardships in their businesses amid the pandemic. The company recorded bad debt expense in the amount of $ 39 million and $81 million (included bad debt expense from discontinuing operations) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, respectively. The Company adopts no policy to accept product returns post to the sales delivery.\nInventories\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average basis) or market. Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process, finished goods and packaging materials. The Company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods and establishes reserves when determined necessary. As of June 30, 2022, and 2021 the Company had no reserve for obsolete goods.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal. The cost of improvements that extend the life of plant, property, and equipment are capitalized. These capitalized costs may include structural improvements, equipment, and fixtures. All ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nBuilding 10-25 years\nAgricultural assets 8 years\nMachinery and equipment 5-15 years\nVehicles 3-5 years\nConstruction in Progress\nConstruction in progress represents the costs incurred relating to the construction of buildings or new additions to the Companys plant facilities. Costs classified to construction in progress include all costs of obtaining the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for its intended use. No depreciation is provided for construction in progress until the assets are completed and are placed into service. Interest incurred during construction is capitalized into construction in progress.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. As of June 30, 2022, and 2021 the Company determined that there were no impairments of its long-lived assets.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company records intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group at fair value. Intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the entitys future cash flows. The Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The Company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually, or when events and circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, permits the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test required under ASC 350. ASC 350 also allows the option to skip the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative assessment.\nUnder the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test. Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner comparable to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. As of June 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company performed the required impairment review which resulted in impairment adjustment with amount of 0 in 2022 and impairment adjustment with amount of $5,984,611 in 2021. The impairment is reported in General and administrative expenses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic events will continue to evolve and the effects on our businesses may differ from what we currently estimate. If the effects prove to be worse than is reflected in our current estimates, additional goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges could be required.\nFair Value Measurement and Disclosures\nOur accounting for Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entitys own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel one - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel two - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel three - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The Company uses a binomial option pricing model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there is no derivative financial instruments.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606. ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entitys contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe Company has assessed the impact of the guidance by performing the following five steps analysis:\nStep 1: Identify the contract\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price\nStep 5: Recognize revenue\nBased on the assessment, the Company concluded that there was no change to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition for its current revenue streams in scope of Topic 606 and therefore there were no material changes to the Companys consolidated financial statements upon adoption of ASC 606.\nSales revenue is recognized on the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe Companys revenue consists of invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (VAT). No product return or sales discount allowance are made as products delivered and accepted by customers are not returnable and sales discounts are not granted after products are delivered.\nCustomer deposits\nPayments received before all the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as customer deposits. When all revenue recognition criteria are met, the customer deposits are recognized as revenue. As of June 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had customer deposits of $7,994,669 and $6,090,156, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe costs of all employee stock option, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award-the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Stock compensation for stock granted to non-employees is determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nIncome taxes\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 740, Income Taxes. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time. Changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. See Note 12, Taxes Payable, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding ASC 740.\nForeign currency translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the US dollar. The functional currency of the Company and Green New Jersey is the US dollar. The functional currency of the Chinese subsidiaries is the Chinese Yuan or Renminbi (RMB). For the subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the US dollar, all asset and liability accounts were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders equity is translated at the historical rates and items in the income statement and cash flow statements are translated at the average rate in each applicable period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the statement of shareholders equity. The resulting translation gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency is included in the results of operations as incurred.\nSegment reporting\nThe Company utilizes the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a companys management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other way management disaggregates a company.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company, through its subsidiaries is engaged into three main business segments based on location and product: Jinong (fertilizer production), Gufeng (fertilizer production) and Yuxing (agricultural products production). As of June 30, 2022, the Company maintained three main business segments.\nFair values of financial instruments\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized based on whether the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Companys financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, advances to suppliers, accounts payable, other payables, tax payable, and related party advances and borrowings.\nAs of the balance sheet dates, the estimated fair values of the financial instruments were not materially different from their carrying values as presented on the balance sheets. This is attributed to the short maturities of the instruments and that interest rates on the borrowings approximate those that would have been available for loans of similar remaining maturity and risk profile at respective balance sheet dates.\nStatement of cash flows\nThe Companys cash flows from operations are calculated based on the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows may not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.\nThe components of basic and diluted earnings per share consist of the following:\nYears Ended June 30,\n(Loss) from continuing operations for Basic Earnings Per Share $ (80,522,696 ) $ (124,993,809 )\n(Loss) Income from discontinued operations for Basic Earnings Per Share (17,841,636 ) 5,246,192\n(Loss) for Basic Earnings Per Share (98,364,332 ) (119,747,617 )\nBasic Weighted Average Number of Shares 9,348,100 6,847,732\n(Loss) from continuing operations Per Share - Basic $ (8.61 ) $ (18.25 )\n(Loss) Income from discontinued operations Per Share - Basic $ (1.91 ) $ 0.77\nNet (Loss) Per Share - Basic $ (10.52 ) $ (17.49 )\n(Loss) from continuing operations for Diluted Earnings Per Share $ (80,522,696 ) $ (124,993,809 )\n(Loss) Income from discontinued operations for Diluted Earnings Per Share $ (17,841,636 ) $ 5,246,192\n(Loss) for Diluted Earnings Per Share $ (98,364,332 ) $ (119,747,617 )\nDiluted Weighted Average Number of Shares 9,348,100 6,847,732\n(Loss) from continuing operations Per Share - Diluted $ (8.61 ) (18.25 )\n(Loss) Income from discontinued operations Per Share - Diluted $ (1.91 ) $ 0.77\nNet (Loss) Per Share - Diluted $ (10.52 ) $ (17.49 )\nReclassification\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior year consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2022 consolidated financial statement presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income or cash flows as previously reported.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU), ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of ASC 740 to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company evaluated the impact that with the adoption of ASU 2019-12, and it did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception and simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2023, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CERCERN\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows in the fiscal year 2022 and may continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows as the Company implements its future business plan. If the situation exists, there could be substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as going concern.\nTo meet its working capital needs through the next twelve months and to fund the growth of the Company, the Company may consider plans to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or borrow loan from local bank. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully execute its new business strategy and eventually attain profitable operations.\nThe accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as going concern.\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC.

On or after the third anniversary of the issuance date of the note, noteholders may request Jinong to process the note conversion to convert the note into shares of the Companys common stock. The notes cannot be converted prior to the mature date. The per share conversion price of the notes is the higher of the following: (i) $5.00 per share or (ii) 75% of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date the noteholder delivers the conversion notice. Due to the discontinuation of VIE agreements with Zhenbais shareholders, certain convertible notes issued on June 30, 2016 with a face amount of RMB 12,000,000 ($1,791,600) were tendered back to the Company. All outstanding balance of unpaid principal and accrued interest in the tendered convertible notes were forfeited.\nOn November 15, 2019, the Company issued 995,000 shares of common stock at the price of $5.00 per share for the total amount of $4,975,000 to the holders of the Companys convertible notes payable in connection with the payment of the convertible notes principal and interests.

The TCJA required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal year 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 27.5%.

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic. The epidemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China and in the U.S.\nXian City, where our headquarters are located, is one of the most affected areas in China. The Company has been following the orders of local government and health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its employees, including the closures of its offices and having employees work remotely from January of 2020 until March of 2020. An occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations and financial results.\nSubstantially all our revenues are generated in China. Consequently, our results of operations were adversely and materially affected by COVID-19. Any potential impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf temporary closure of offices, travel restrictions or suspension of transportation of our products to our customers and our suppliers have been negatively affected, and could continue to be negatively affected, on their ability to supply our demands;\n\u25cf our customers that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase our products and services, which may materially adversely impact our revenue;\n\u25cf we may have to provide significant sales incentives to our customers in response to the outbreak, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf the business operations of our customers and suppliers have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the outbreak, result in loss of customers or disruption of our services, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;\nCHINA GREEN AGRICULTURE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\n\u25cf any disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including causing our suppliers to cease manufacturing products for a period or materially delay delivery to customers, which may also lead to loss of customers, as well as reputational, competitive, and business harm to us;\n\u25cf many of our customers, distributors, suppliers, and other partners are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and they may be vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs that we work with cannot weather COVID-19 and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted;\n\u25cf the global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant decline from the COVID-19 outbreak, which could materially adversely affect our stock price;\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the COVID-19 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but our results for the full fiscal year of 2022 had been adversely affected.\nIn general, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus, or other outbreaks. In response to an epidemic or other outbreaks, government and other organizations may adopt regulations and policies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations, including temporary closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions may cause us and/or our partners to make internal adjustments, including but not limited to, temporarily closing business, limiting business hours, and setting restrictions on travel and/or visits with clients and partners for a prolonged period. Various impacts arising from severe conditions may cause business disruption, resulting in material, adverse effects to our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are taking significant measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 as well as additional actions to improve our liquidity through cost reduction and conservation measures.\nNOTE 23 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations after June 30, 2022 to the date these consolidated financial statements were available to be issued.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company completed the issuance of 1,117,142 shares of its Common Stock for $16,757,130 to P Kevin HODL Ltd, an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Zhibiao Pan, who was subsequently appointed as the Companys co-Chief Executive Officer on August 25, 2022.
