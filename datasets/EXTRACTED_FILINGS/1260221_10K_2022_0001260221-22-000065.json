    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nThe Company\nTD Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TransDigm Inc., is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. Our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers. We estimate that approximately 90% of our net sales for fiscal year 2022 were generated by proprietary products.\nMost of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft, we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft, which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years. A typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years, giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years. We estimate that approximately 55% of our net sales in fiscal year 2022 were generated from the aftermarket, the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets. Historically, these aftermarket revenues have produced a higher gross profit and have been more stable than net sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\nPre-pandemic, and as our business continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance we believe that due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long-term.\nProducts\nWe primarily design, produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components with significant aftermarket content. We seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. We attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. We typically choose not to compete for non-proprietary build to print business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products. We believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality, reliability and strong customer support.\nOur business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers. Our major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems. Each of our product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer.\nSegments\nThe Companys businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments: Power & Control, Airframe and Non-aviation.\nThe Power & Control segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technologies. Major product offerings include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, databus and power controls, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems. Primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.\nThe Airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that are used in non-power airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. Major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology and parachutes. Primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.\nThe Non-aviation segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market products for non-aviation markets. Major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications, mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls for space applications, hydraulic/electromechanical actuators and fuel valves for land-based gas turbines, and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries and turbine controls for the energy and oil and gas markets. Primary customers of this segment are off-road vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers, child restraint system suppliers, satellite and space system suppliers, manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries and turbine original equipment manufacturers, gas pipeline builders and electric utilities.\nThe primary measurement used by management to review and assess the operating performance of each segment is EBITDA As Defined. The Company defines EBITDA As Defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with the Companys stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, restructuring costs related to the Company's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. COVID-19 restructuring costs represented actions primarily taken by the Company in fiscal 2021 and 2020 to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand, as well as incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations (e.g., additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements, personal protective equipment). Acquisition and divestiture-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Companys operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments.\nFor financial information about our segments, refer to Note 17, Segments, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nSales and Marketing\nConsistent with our overall strategy, our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs. In particular, we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to high-margin, repeatable sales in the aftermarket.\nWe have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings, assigning a business unit manager to certain products. Each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings, net sales, new business and profitability for such products. The business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major OEM and aftermarket accounts. Account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel, organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals for each account and, together with the business unit managers, to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations. Most of our sales personnel are evaluated, in part, on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities.\nThough typically performed by employees, the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer, product and geographic location. We also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts. Boeing Distribution Services, Inc., Satair A/S (a subsidiary of Airbus S.A.S.) and AAR Corp., among others, are our major distributors.\nManufacturing and Engineering\nWe maintain approximately 100 manufacturing facilities. Most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing, distribution and engineering functions, and most facilities have certain administrative functions, including management, sales and finance. We continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs, including rationalization of operations, developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting, investing in equipment, tooling, information systems (including cybersecurity) and implementing broad-based employee training programs. Management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers.\nWe attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery. Our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income. Research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income. The aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 10% of our operating units aggregate costs, or approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2022. Our proprietary products, and particularly our new product initiatives, are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry. These proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers tolerance and quality requirements. Refer to Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to the total costs of research and development.\nWe use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements, specifications and aviation authority and OEM requirements. We perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers, such as testing under different temperature, humidity and altitude levels, flammability testing, shock and vibration testing and X-ray fluorescent measurement. These procedures, together with other customer approved techniques for document, process and quality control, are used throughout our manufacturing facilities.\nCustomers\nWe predominantly serve customers in the commercial, regional, business jet and general aviation aftermarket, which accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales for fiscal year 2022; the commercial aerospace OEM market, comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers, which accounted for approximately 21% of our net sales for fiscal year 2022; and the defense market (which includes defense OEMs and aftermarket sales to the U.S. and friendly foreign governments), which accounted for approximately 43% of our net sales for fiscal year 2022. Non-aerospace net sales comprised approximately 7% of our net sales for fiscal year 2022.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on air travel worldwide, the commercial aerospace industry has been significantly disrupted. To a lesser extent, the defense aerospace market has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with this impact arising primarily from supply chain shortages. This has led to the defense market comprising a greater percentage of our net sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 compared to pre-pandemic historical levels. In fiscal years 2015 through 2019, defense market net sales ranged from 29% to 37% of total net sales. As the commercial aerospace industry continues to recover, we expect defense market net sales to account for a percentage of total net sales that is relatively in line with our historical levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We began to see this expected trend in fiscal 2022, as defense sales represented 43% of net sales compared to 50% of net sales in fiscal 2021.\nOur customers include: (1) distributors of aerospace components; (2) worldwide commercial airlines, including national and regional airlines; (3) large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft OEMs; (4) various armed forces of the United States and friendly foreign governments; (5) defense OEMs; (6) system suppliers; and (7) various other industrial customers. Our top ten customers for fiscal year 2022 accounted for approximately 41% of our net sales. Products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms. None of our customers individually accounted for greater than 10% of our net sales for fiscal year 2022.\nThe markets in which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns. The demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on, among other things, the breadth of our installed OEM base, revenue passenger miles (RPMs), the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, the percentage of the worldwide fleet that is in warranty, and airline profitability. The demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends, military campaigns and political pressures.\nCompetition\nThe niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide. Due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry, competition in these categories comes from both U.S. and foreign companies. Competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately-held entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios.\nWe compete on the basis of engineering, manufacturing and marketing high quality products, which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers, consistent and timely delivery, and superior customer service and support. The industrys stringent regulatory, certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products. If customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards, we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process. In addition, we believe that the availability, dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue long-term supplier relationships.\nGovernment Contracts\nCompanies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to United States Government (U.S. Government) agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally: (1) suspend us from receiving new contracts; (2) terminate existing contracts; (3) reduce the value of existing contracts; (4) audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; (5) control and potentially prohibit the export of our products; and (6) seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances. Violations of government procurement laws could result in civil or criminal penalties.\nGovernmental Regulation\nThe commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in Europe and other agencies throughout the world, while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications. We, and the components we manufacture, are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies, and, in many cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.\nWe must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs and airlines that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations. In addition, the FAA and other aviation authorities require that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. We also maintain several FAA-approved repair stations.\nIn addition, our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters. Without limiting the foregoing, sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses, including the disposal of hazardous wastes, are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws.\nMarket Channels\nThe commercial aerospace industry, including the aftermarket and OEM markets, is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world. The commercial aerospace industry, in particular, has been significantly disrupted, both domestically and internationally, by the COVID-19 pandemic. The commercial aerospace industry experienced a steep decline in RPMs beginning in the second half of our fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemics impact on worldwide air travel demand. RPMs have significantly recovered from pandemic lows, but remained depressed in fiscal 2022 when compared to pre-pandemic levels. Also, as a result of the pandemic and decreased demand in commercial air travel, the commercial OEM sector experienced reductions in commercial OEM production rates, including reductions at the two largest commercial OEMs, The Boeing Company (Boeing) and Airbus S.A.S. (Airbus). Throughout fiscal 2022, the commercial aerospace industry continued to recover towards pre-pandemic levels. In fiscal 2022, commercial air travel demand trended upward, and both Boeing and Airbus increased OEM production rates. Boeing and Airbus are also expecting further improvement in OEM production rates during calendar 2023. These trends are favorable; however, uncertainty remains in the shape and pace of the commercial aerospace industrys path to a full recovery.\nThe defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints, the timing of orders, political pressures and the extent of global conflicts. It is not necessarily affected by the same general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry. The defense aerospace market has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market with this impact arising primarily from supply chain shortages. Additionally, within the defense market, the pace of U.S. government defense spending outlays and government funding reprioritization provides for uncertainty.\nHistorically, our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry has served to mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk. We service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry, and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft, which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform. At times, declines in net sales in one channel have been offset by increased net sales in another channel. However, due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to OEM and aftermarket customers, variation in product mix can cause variation in gross profit.\nOutside of the market disruption caused by COVID-19, there are many short-term factors (including customer inventory level adjustments, supply chain issues, unannounced changes in order patterns, strikes, facility shutdowns caused by fires, hurricanes, health crises or other incidents and mergers and acquisitions) that can cause short-term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years. As such, it can be difficult to determine longer-term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons. To normalize for short-term fluctuations, we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short-term periods. Additionally, there are fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket product mix from quarter-to-quarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit since commercial aftermarket net sales have historically produced higher gross profit margins than net sales to commercial OEMs. Again, in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators.\nCommercial Aftermarket\nThe key market factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide RPMs and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the stringent measures implemented to help control the pandemic, demand for air travel declined at a rapid pace and led to a significant reduction in flights. Although worldwide air traffic remains significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels, RPMs continued to steadily improve in fiscal 2022 and many aircraft parked by airlines have been returned to service. Commercial air travel in domestic markets continued to lead the air traffic recovery in fiscal 2022 with certain domestic markets nearing pre-pandemic air traffic levels. The pace of the international air traffic recovery has been slower than the domestic recovery, but international RPMs made positive strides in fiscal 2022 and are catching up to the domestic air traffic recovery. Current industry consensus indicates that worldwide RPMs will continue to recover in 2023. Overall, the timing and pace of the commercial aftermarket recovery remains uncertain and continues to evolve.\nCommercial OEM Market\nThe commercial OEM market remained depressed in fiscal 2022 primarily due to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain disruptions throughout the commercial OEM supply chain and Boeings ongoing regulatory and quality challenges with the 737 MAX aircraft (particularly in China) and the 787 aircraft. Our commercial transport OEM shipments and revenues generally run ahead of Boeing and Airbus aircraft delivery schedules. As a result, and consistent with prior years, our fiscal 2023 shipments will be a function of, among other things, the estimated 2023 and 2024 commercial aircraft production rates. We have been experiencing depressed net sales across the commercial OEM sector primarily due to the lower than pre-pandemic production rates at Boeing and Airbus, although production rates slowly began to improve in fiscal 2022. We expect demand for our commercial OEM products to continue to be reduced in the short-term. The commercial OEM market is now showing signs of recovery with airlines returning to the commercial OEMs to place orders; however, the commercial OEM supply chain challenges impacting Boeing and Airbus are slowing the pace of new aircraft manufacturing. Both Boeing and Airbus have disclosed further planned OEM production rate increases for calendar 2023. The pace of the recovery of the commercial OEM market remains uncertain and continues to evolve.\nOur businesses continually seek to provide solutions for our customers and others in the commercial aerospace industry. Our current initiatives include creating new products that are more environmentally friendly, such as radiation-free exciters, and creating new products that will help further improve commercial airlines efforts to keep passengers healthy and safe, such as touch-free aircraft lavatory suite products.\nDefense\nOur military business fluctuates from year-to-year, and is dependent, to a degree, on government budget constraints, the timing of orders, macro and micro dynamics with respect to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) procurement policy and the extent of global conflicts. Also, delays in government spending outlays and government funding reprioritization, such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic or efforts to assist Ukraine in the Russia and Ukraine conflict, provides for further unpredictability in the military spending outlook. For a variety of reasons, the military spending outlook is very uncertain, though recent DOD budgets have trended upwards.\nRaw Materials\nWe require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes. We purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers. We also purchase replacement parts, which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations. At times, we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships. Most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to disrupt the global supply chain to a certain extent and availability of raw materials, particularly electronic parts, which primarily are utilized to produce products in the defense market channel. Because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive FAA and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have various trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, which we believe, in the aggregate but not individually, are important to our business. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold using a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire in the future. The Company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis. Based on the broad scope of the Companys product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.\nFor information regarding environmental accruals, refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws during fiscal 2022 had no material impact on our capital expenditures or results of operations. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future. For further information on environmental-related risks, including climate change, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are material risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Strategy\nWe face risks related to the current COVID-19 pandemic and other health pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to cause an adverse impact on our employees, operations, supply chain and distribution system and the long-term impact to our business remains unknown. This is due to the numerous uncertainties that have risen from the pandemic, including the likelihood of resurgences and the emergence and spread of variants, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease, the continued efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, and unintended consequences of the foregoing.\nThe commercial aerospace industry, in particular, has been significantly disrupted, both domestically and internationally, by the pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments and other measures. As a result, demand for travel declined at a rapid pace beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 and has remained depressed compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted the global supply chain and availability of raw materials, particularly electronic parts. The disruption in the supply chain has resulted in increased freight costs, raw material costs and labor costs from the ongoing inflationary environment. Our business has been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in our ability to timely obtain raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive aviation authority and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part. Because the duration of the pandemic is unclear, it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the Companys future results. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, supply chain, consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur business focuses almost exclusively on the aerospace and defense industry.\nDuring a prolonged period of significant market disruption in the aerospace and defense industry, such as the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the commercial aerospace market, and other macroeconomic factors such as when recessions occur, our business may be disproportionately impacted compared to peer companies that are more diversified in the industries they serve. A more diversified company with significant sales and earnings derived from outside the aerospace and defense sector may be able to recover more quickly from significant market disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales.\nIn fiscal year 2022, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of the Companys net sales; however, our top ten customers for fiscal year 2022 accounted for approximately 41% of our net sales. A material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason, including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic or aerospace downturn, decreased production, strike or resourcing, could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products. Further, when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, we take the risk for cost overruns.\nAs is customary in our business, we do not generally have long-term contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and, therefore, do not have guaranteed future sales. Although we have long-term contracts with many of our OEM customers, many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and, in most cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements, and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize.\nWe also have entered into multi-year, fixed-price contracts with some of our customers, pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products. This risk is greater in a high inflationary environment, such as currently. Sometimes we accept a fixed-price contract for a product that we have not yet produced, and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices, taxes or labor costs.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions. Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms, or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations.\nA significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions. Any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. We intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support. In addition, we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions. Because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.\nWe regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities. If we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. Future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs.\nAcquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business. The successful integration of new businesses, with the most significant recent acquisition being the DART Aerospace acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they have to service, attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2022, our total indebtedness, excluding approximately $31 million in letters of credit outstanding, was approximately $20 billion, which was 123.5% of our total book capitalization.\nIn addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $779 million of unused commitments under our revolving credit facility. Although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior secured and senior subordinated notes outstanding (the Indentures) contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial. A breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the Indentures.\nAn increase in our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors. For example, it could:\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions;\nincrease the risk we are subjected to downgrade or put on a negative watch by the ratings agencies;\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, make investments and incur liens.\nAll of our debt under the senior secured credit facility, which includes $7.3 billion in term loans and a revolving credit facility of $810 million, bears interest at variable rates primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for deposits of U.S. dollars. Accordingly, if LIBOR or other variable interest rates increase, our debt service expense will also increase. In order to mitigate the interest rate risk of these variable rate borrowings, we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements that cover a significant portion of the existing variable rate debt. The Company's objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 85% of our total debt was fixed rate. For information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements, refer to Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Instruments, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for the remaining tenors of USD LIBOR (one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2023. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates. In February 2020, in connection with Amendment No. 7 and the Refinancing Facility Agreement (herein, Amendment No. 7) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 4, 2014 (the Credit Agreement), we amended our Credit Agreement to include a provision for the determination of an alternative reference interest rate. Additionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we have elected the LIBOR protocols issued by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, but the discontinuation of LIBOR may also require our derivative agreements to be amended in some way. Once the alternative interest rate has replaced LIBOR, our future interest expense could be impacted.\nOur indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness, including the Indentures. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Indentures, amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts due under our trade receivable securitization facility (Securitization Facility), and to fund our operations, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility, amounts borrowed under our Securitization Facility and the Indentures, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our debt, we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, the Securitization Facility, the Indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the Indentures.\nThe terms of the senior secured credit facility and Indentures may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nOur senior secured credit facility and the Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The senior secured credit facility and Indentures include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the senior secured credit facility) and TransDigm Inc. and its subsidiaries (in the case of the Indentures) to:\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\npay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;\nmake investments;\nsell assets;\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\nincur or allow to exist liens;\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries; and\nengage in certain business activities.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the Indentures. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior secured and senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility, the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes. If the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior secured or subordinated notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers, senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage, difficulty hiring similar employees, or ineffective succession planning could adversely affect our business.\nBecause our products are complicated and highly engineered, we depend on an educated and trained workforce. Historically, there has been substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aerospace and defense industry, and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees. We may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel. We cannot be assured that we can continue to hire, train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market, and there are currently significant inflationary and other pressures on wages.\nReduction in force actions, such as the actions primarily taken in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 to reduce our workforce to align operations with customer demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in difficulty in rehiring capable employees to refill the positions eliminated as needed once business recovers.\nAlthough we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable. Because we strive to limit the volume of finished goods inventory, any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers.\nIn addition, our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. If we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of key personnel, senior management and our executive officers, including our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. The Companys Board of Directors continually monitors this risk and we believe that the Companys succession plan, together with our straightforward strategy, clear value drivers, decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nOur sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical, and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us.\nOur sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft, such as Boeing, Airbus, and related OEM suppliers, as well as manufacturers of business jets have historically experienced periodic downturns. In the past, these sales have been affected by airline profitability, which is impacted by, among other things, fuel and labor costs, price competition, interest rates, downturns in the global economy and national and international events. In addition, sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by, among other things, downturns in the global economy. In recent years, such as in fiscal 2021 and the second half of fiscal 2020, we have experienced decreased sales across the commercial OEM sector driven primarily by the decrease in production by Boeing and Airbus related to reduced demand in the commercial aerospace industry from the COVID-19 pandemic, and airlines deferring or cancelling orders. Regulatory and quality challenges, such as with Boeings 737 MAX aircraft and 787 aircraft, also has an adverse impact. Downturns adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers.\nOur business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components. Our business, therefore, could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers (such as the destruction of our suppliers facilities or their distribution infrastructure, a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality), or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to disrupt the global supply chain. We currently are experiencing supply shortages and inflationary pressures for certain components and raw materials that are important to our manufacturing process, particularly electronic parts. Expected growth in the global economy may exacerbate these pressures on us and our suppliers, and we expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. Because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive aviation authority and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies. Competitors in our product lines are both U.S. and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately-held entities. We believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance, consistent high quality, short lead-time and timely delivery, competitive pricing, superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.\nClimate-related regulations designed to address climate change may result in additional compliance costs.\nOur operations and the products we sell are currently subject to rules limiting emissions and to other climate-related regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate. The increased prevalence of global climate change concerns may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us, our suppliers and customers. We are continuing to evaluate short-, medium- and long-term risks related to climate change. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers, in which case, the costs of raw materials and component parts could increase.\nAs a whole, because our manufacturing facilities primarily engage in assembly and light manufacturing and because we do not maintain any transportation infrastructure, we have relatively low Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any material adverse impact from increased carbon regulation directly on our manufacturing operations. Further, because of our wide portfolio of hundreds of thousands of products, we do not anticipate any material adverse impact from the reliance on a supplier or group of suppliers that may be subject to climate risks. However, regulation that would have a material adverse impact on air travel could have a material adverse impact on our business. Given the political significance and uncertainty around these issues, we cannot predict how legislation, regulation, and increased awareness of these issues will affect our operations and financial condition. We have established a science-aligned greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least a 50% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions on an absolute basis by the year 2031. Fiscal 2019 is the selected baseline year for TransDigm that we will compare against as we make progress towards our emissions reduction goal. We continue to evaluate ways to reduce our energy and water consumption and lower our greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency measures, the purchase of green power and other actions.\nOur operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nOur operations and those of our customers and suppliers have been and may again be subject to natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemics or other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses. Some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that may be impacted by severe weather events, such as increased storm frequency or severity in the Atlantic and fires in hotter and drier climates. These could result in potential damage to our physical assets as well as disruptions in manufacturing activities. Some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that may be at risk due to rising sea levels. Moreover, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that could experience decreased access to water due to climate issues.\nWe are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fire, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Disruptions could also occur due to health-related outbreaks and crises, cyber attacks, computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error or process failures. Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOperations and sales outside of the United States may be subject to additional risks.\nOur net sales to foreign customers were approximately $1.9 billion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including war, sanctions, global health crises, currency fluctuations, difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations, general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate, limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, change in trade policies, tariff regulation, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition.\nIssues with the global supply chain can also rise due to some of the aforementioned risks, as well as the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality or safety issues, shipping and transport availability and cost, increases in wage rates and taxes, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import. Such issues are often beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Furthermore, the Company is subject to laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and similar local anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their employees, agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject the Company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are monitoring the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. Although the conflict has not resulted in a direct material adverse impact on TransDigm's business to date, the implications of the Russia and Ukraine conflict in the short-term and long-term are difficult to predict at this time. Factors such as increased energy costs, increased freight costs, the availability of certain raw materials for aircraft manufacturers, embargoes on flights from Russian airlines, sanctions on Russian companies, and the stability of Ukrainian customers could impact the global economy and aviation sector.\nWe are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the U.S. Government.\nCompanies engaged in supplying defense-related equipment and services to U.S. Government agencies, whether through direct contracts with the U.S. Government or as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the U.S. Government, are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government to unilaterally:\nsuspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\nterminate existing contracts;\nrevoke required security clearances;\nreduce the value of existing contracts; and\naudit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.\nMost of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government at its convenience without significant notice. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination.\nOn contracts for which the price is based on cost, the U.S. Government may review our costs and performance, as well as our accounting and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. Government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of research and development costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement.\nFurthermore, even where the price is not based on cost, the U.S. Government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is fair and reasonable. Our subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries products are periodically subject to audits by the DOD Office of Inspector General (OIG) with respect to prices paid for such products. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we voluntarily refunded $16.0 million to the U.S. Government following an OIG audit, and the DOD has requested refunds of $20.8 million in response to another OIG audit completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In addition, our defense-related business has been the subject of an ongoing Congressional inquiry by the House Oversight Committee; Congressional inquiries are costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business. As a result of these reviews, audits and inquiries, we could be subject to providing further refunds to the U.S. Government, we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost, the DOD could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts, or the U.S. Government could take other adverse actions with respect to our contracts. Any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from, or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with, certain agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government. Further, negative publicity relating to the results of any audit, inquiry or subsequent hearing or the like could negatively impact our stock price.\nIf a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. Government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, U.S. Government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements, which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting. Failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased.\nThe aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. and in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must be certified by the FAA, the DOD and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers. If new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases, we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight. In addition, if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our business would be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the aviation approvals, we are at times required to obtain approval from U.S. Government agencies and similar agencies elsewhere in the world to export our products. U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). EAR restricts the export of commercial and dual-use products and technical data to certain countries, while ITAR restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services.\nFailure to obtain approval to export or determination by the U.S. Government or similar agencies elsewhere in the world that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the United States or other country of origin, and the penalties that could be imposed by the U.S. Government or other applicable government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns.\nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S. and Europe, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Further, although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the GDPR, CCPA and other privacy-related laws, rules and regulations (collectively, the Data Protection Laws), there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all Data Protection Laws.\nIncreased cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime have posed and could continue to pose a risk to our information technology systems and a disruption to or breach in the security of such systems, if material, could have adverse effects on our result of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business, some of which are managed by third parties. The security and functionality of these information technology systems, and the processing of data by these systems, are critical to our business operations. If these systems, or any part of the systems, are damaged, intruded upon, attacked, shutdown or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, criminal acts, including hardware or software break-ins or extortion attempts, or viruses, or other cybersecurity incidents) and we suffer any resulting interruption in our ability to manage and operate our business or if our products are affected, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In fact, we have experienced data security incidents, although these have not had a material impact on our financial results. Furthermore, the Company has access to classified, sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls.\nDespite our use of reasonable and appropriate technical security controls and monitoring, security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or employee errors and/or malfeasance have led and could in the future lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information. Such events may result in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, failure to comply with laws governing sensitive data, negative publicity, loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property, loss of competitiveness or customers, increased security and compliance costs or other negative consequences. Further, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity incident. Depending on the nature and magnitude of these events, they may have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by subsidiaries of the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.\nEstimates of the Companys environmental liabilities are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. These estimates take into consideration the Companys prior experience and professional judgment of the Companys environmental advisors. Estimates of the Companys environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates, the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.\nAccordingly, as investigations and remediations proceed, it is likely that adjustments in the Companys accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in a given period. Based on currently available information, however, the Company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits, including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe could be adversely affected if one of our products cause an aircraft to crash.\nOur operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft product that we have designed, manufactured or serviced. While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate. We also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us.\nIn addition, a crash caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for quality products. We believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft products. If a crash were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nWe have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, which may never generate the returns we expect.\nMergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets, which primarily include trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and technology, were approximately $2.8 billion at September 30, 2022, representing approximately 15% of our total assets. Goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately $8.6 billion at September 30, 2022, representing approximately 48% of our total assets. We may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards, we would be required to write-off the amount of any impairment.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Companys domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. The Companys future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the Companys effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid by the Company is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Companys tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nWe do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock.\nNotwithstanding special cash dividends, of which the most recent declaration by the Companys Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 in the amount of $18.50 per outstanding share of common stock, we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future.\nThe amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements. Any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Therefore, shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all.\nGeneral Risks\nOur commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers profitability. These items are, in turn, affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions.\nOur commercial business is directly affected by, among other factors, changes in RPMs, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, the percentage of the fleet that is out-of-warranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry. RPMs and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment, although national and international events also play a key role. For example, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse impact it has had on the airline industry, past examples in which the airline industry has been negatively affected include downturns in the global economy, higher fuel prices, increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of September 11, 2001, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and conflicts abroad. Additional examples include future geopolitical or other worldwide events, such as war, terrorist acts, or additional worldwide infectious disease outbreaks.\nIn addition, global market and economic conditions have been challenging due to turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending. As a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from the aforementioned events, the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties. Some carriers parked or retired a portion of their fleets and reduced workforces and flights. During periods of reduced airline profitability, some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts, preferring instead to deplete existing inventories, and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending. If demand for spare parts decreases, there would be a decrease in demand for certain products. An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.\nU.S. military spending is dependent upon the U.S. defense budget.\nThe military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends, particularly the DOD budget. In addition to normal business risks, our supply of products to the U.S. Government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. DOD budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the presidential election or otherwise, the U.S. Governments budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic or efforts to assist Ukraine in the Russia and Ukraine conflict), the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce U.S. Government military spending, each of which could cause the DOD budget to remain unchanged or to decline. A significant decline in U.S. military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the U.S. Government.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities. These market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. Such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in OEM and aftermarket ordering, which could cause short-term swings in profit margins. Or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance, such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock, such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy, changes to or confidence in our management, or expectations for future growth of the Company. Global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic could also cause significant volatility in the market price. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2.

As of September 30, 2022, $1,288 million remains available for repurchase under the $2,200 million stock repurchase program. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with TD Groups consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.\nOverview\nFor fiscal year 2022, we generated net sales of $5,429 million, gross profit of $3,099 million or 57.1% of net sales, and net income attributable to TD Group of $866 million. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to have an adverse impact on our net sales, net income and EBITDA As Defined when compared to pre-pandemic levels. Pre-pandemic, and as our business continues to recover from the pandemic, we believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. More specifically, we believe that focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long-term.\nOur selective acquisition strategy has also been an important contribution to the growth of our business. The integration of acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of the acquired business.\nWe believe our key competitive strengths include:\nLarge and Growing Installed Product Base with Aftermarket Revenue Stream. We provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. We estimate that our products are installed on over 100,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.\nDiversified Revenue Base. We believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. Our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. We expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications. Our current initiatives include creating new products that are more environmentally friendly, such as radiation-free exciters, and creating new products that will help further improve commercial airlines efforts to keep passengers healthy and safe, such as touch-free aircraft lavatory suite products.\nOur business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.\nValue-Driven Operating Strategy. Our three core value drivers are:\nObtaining Profitable New Business. We attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. We have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and OEM products to drive our growth.\nImproving Our Cost Structure. We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.\nProviding Highly Engineered Value-Added Products to Customers. We focus on the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers. We believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products. This has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so.\nSelective Acquisition Strategy. We selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. The aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. We have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. As of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 87 businesses and product lines since our formation in 1993. Many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing TransDigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume. In the case of larger acquisitions that consist of multiple operating units (such as the Esterline acquisition), we may pursue opportunities to divest certain acquired operating units that are not in line with our long-term acquisition strategy.\nAcquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years are described in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nThe commercial aerospace industry, in particular, has been significantly disrupted, both domestically and internationally, by the pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments and other measures. As a result, demand for travel declined at a rapid pace beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 and has remained depressed compared to pre-pandemic levels. Although worldwide air traffic remains significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels, RPMs continued to steadily improve in fiscal 2022 and many aircraft parked by airlines have been returned to service. Commercial air travel in domestic markets continued to lead the air traffic recovery in fiscal 2022 with certain domestic markets nearing pre-pandemic air traffic levels. The pace of the international air traffic recovery has been slower than the domestic recovery, but international RPMs made positive strides in fiscal 2022 and are catching up to the domestic air traffic recovery. The commercial OEM market is continuing to show signs of recovery with airlines returning to the commercial OEMs to place orders; however, the commercial OEM supply chain challenges impacting manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus are slowing the pace of new aircraft manufacturing. The exact pace and timing of the commercial air travel recovery remains uncertain and continues to evolve.\nThe defense aerospace market has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market with this impact arising primarily from supply chain shortages. Additionally, within the defense market, the pace of U.S. government defense spending outlays and government funding reprioritization provides for uncertainty.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted the global supply chain and availability of raw materials. The disruption in the supply chain has resulted in increased freight costs, raw material costs and labor costs from the ongoing inflationary environment. Our business has been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by disruptions in our ability to timely obtain raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the lengthy and expensive aviation authority and OEM certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material or component part.\nBecause the duration of the pandemic is unclear, it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the Companys future results. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, supply chain, consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe are also monitoring the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors, including the aviation sector, and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. Although the conflict has not resulted in a direct material adverse impact on TransDigm's business to date, the implications of the Russia and Ukraine conflict in the short-term and long-term are difficult to predict at this time. Factors such as increased energy costs, the availability of certain raw materials for aircraft manufacturers, embargoes on flights from Russian airlines, sanctions on Russian companies, and the stability of Ukrainian customers could impact the global economy and aviation sector.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data of the Company, including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales (amounts in millions, except per share data):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 % of Net Sales 2021 % of Net Sales\nNet sales $ 5,429 100.0 % $ 4,798 100.0 %\nCost of sales 2,330 42.9 % 2,285 47.6 %\nSelling and administrative expenses 748 13.8 % 685 14.3 %\nAmortization of intangible assets 136 2.5 % 137 2.9 %\nIncome from operations 2,215 40.8 % 1,691 35.2 %\nInterest expense, net 1,076 19.8 % 1,059 22.1 %\nRefinancing costs 1 - % 37 0.8 %\nOther expense (income) 18 0.3 % (51) (1.1) %\nGain on sale of businesses, net (7) (0.1) % (69) (1.4) %\nIncome tax provision 261 4.8 % 34 0.7 %\nIncome from continuing operations 866 16.0 % 681 14.2 %\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1) - % (1) - %\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to TD Group 865 15.9 % 680 14.2 %\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax 1 - % - - %\nNet income attributable to TD Group $ 866 16.0 % $ 680 14.2 %\nNet income applicable to TD Group common stockholders $ 780 (1)\n14.4 % $ 607 (1)\n12.7 %\nEarnings per share:\nEarnings per share from continuing operations-basic and diluted $ 13.38 (2)\n$ 10.41 (2)\nEarnings per share from discontinued operations-basic and diluted 0.02 (2)\n- (2)\nEarnings per share $ 13.40 $ 10.41\nCash dividends declared per common share $ 18.50 $ -\nWeighted-average shares outstanding-basic and diluted 58.2 58.4\nOther Data:\nEBITDA $ 2,456 (3)\n$ 2,027 (3)\nEBITDA As Defined $ 2,646 (3) 48.7 % $ 2,189 (3) 45.6 %\n(1)Net income applicable to TD Group common stockholders represents net income attributable to TD Group less special dividends paid on participating securities, including dividend equivalent payments of $86 million and $73 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(2)Earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing net income applicable to TD Group common stockholders, excluding income from discontinued operations, net of tax, by the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Earnings per share from discontinued operations is calculated by dividing income from discontinued operations, net of tax, by the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\n(3)Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this discussion and analysis for additional information and limitations regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2021\nTotal Company\nNet Sales. Net organic sales and acquisition and divestiture sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended % Change\nNet Sales\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Change\nOrganic sales $ 5,355 $ 4,665 $ 690 14.4 %\nAcquisition and divestiture sales 74 133 (59) (1.2) %\nNet sales $ 5,429 $ 4,798 $ 631 13.2 %\nOrganic sales represent net sales from existing businesses owned by the Company, excluding sales from acquisitions and divestitures. Acquisition sales represent net sales from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date. Therefore, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Cobham Aero Connectivitys (CAC's) net sales, including the comparable period in the prior year, are included in the organic growth calculation (acquisition date was January 2021). Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, DART Aerospace (DART) is included in the acquisitions and divestitures classification due to the completion of the acquisition by TransDigm. Divestiture sales represent net sales from businesses up to the date the respective divestiture was completed. Acquisition and divestiture sales are excluded from organic sales due to the variability in the nature, timing and extent of acquisitions and divestitures and resulting variable impact on underlying trends. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on the Company's recent acquisition and divestiture activity.\nThe increase in organic sales of $690 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 is primarily related to increases in commercial aftermarket sales ($478 million, an increase of 44.8%) and commercial OEM sales ($221 million, an increase of 23.8%); partially offset by a decrease in defense sales ($52 million, a decrease of 2.2%). The increase in commercial aftermarket sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in commercial air travel demand, particularly the increase in the utilization of narrow-body aircraft, and air cargo demand and the resulting higher flight hours in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in OEM sales is primarily attributable to a higher volume of narrow-body aircraft deliveries by aircraft manufacturers to airlines and also production rate increases of narrow-body aircraft compared to fiscal 2021. Partially offsetting the OEM sales growth are wide-body aircraft production and delivery slowdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacting international travel particularly in the first half of fiscal 2022 and also due to Boeing's ongoing regulatory and quality challenges with the 737 MAX aircraft (particularly in China) and the 787 aircraft. The decrease in defense sales is attributable to continued supply chain shortages resulting in shipment delays and delays in U.S. government defense spend outlays.\nThe decrease in acquisition and divestiture sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to the divestitures of ScioTeq and TREALITY Simulation Visual Systems (ScioTeq and TREALITY), Technical Airborne Components (TAC), Racal Acoustics (Racal) and Avista, Inc. (Avista), all of which were completed in fiscal 2021, partially offset by the acquisitions of CAC and DART.\nCost of Sales and Gross Profit. Cost of sales increased by $45 million, or 2.0%, to $2,330 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2,285 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Cost of sales and the related percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Change % Change\nCost of sales - excluding costs below $ 2,383 $ 2,277 $ 106 4.7 %\n% of net sales 43.9 % 47.5 %\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense 19 13 6 46.2 %\n% of net sales 0.3 % 0.3 %\nAcquisition integration costs 4 4 - - %\n% of net sales 0.1 % 0.1 %\nInventory acquisition accounting adjustments 3 6 (3) (50.0) %\n% of net sales 0.1 % 0.1 %\nCOVID-19 pandemic restructuring costs - 29 (29) (100.0) %\n% of net sales - % 0.6 %\nLoss contract amortization (39) (55) 16 (29.1) %\n% of net sales (0.7) % (1.1) %\nForeign currency (gains) losses (40) 11 (51) (463.6) %\n% of net sales (0.7) % 0.2 %\nTotal cost of sales $ 2,330 $ 2,285 $ 45 2.0 %\n% of net sales 42.9 % 47.6 %\nGross profit (Net sales less Total cost of sales) $ 3,099 $ 2,513 $ 586 23.3 %\nGross profit percentage (Gross profit / Net sales) 57.1 % 52.4 %\nExcluding the specific components to cost of sales listed above, the change in cost of sales during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, which decreased as a percentage of net sales, was primarily driven by a favorable sales mix, specifically, higher commercial aftermarket sales as a percentage of net sales compared to commercial OEM net sales in the prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. In addition, despite increased freight, raw material, and labor costs resulting from the ongoing inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain and labor markets, the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers) coupled with fixed overhead costs incurred being spread over a higher production volume, resulted in gross profit as a percentage of net sales increasing by 4.7 percentage points to 57.1% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from 52.4% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nRegarding the specific components to cost of sales listed above, COVID-19 pandemic restructuring costs were not material in fiscal 2022 and foreign exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound and the euro, strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, resulting in favorable movement compared to the prior year when the U.S. dollar depreciated against both the British pound and euro resulting in foreign currency losses.\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense is higher due to the adoption of a new deferred compensation plan for certain members of non-executive management in fiscal 2022, the impact of the new stock option grants awarded in fiscal 2022 and the impact of a modification approved by the Board of Directors of the performance criteria for the fiscal 2021 and 2020 grants. Refer to Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased by $63 million to $748 million, or 13.8% of net sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from $685 million, or 14.3% of net sales, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Change % Change\nSelling and administrative expenses - excluding costs below $ 563 $ 534 $ 29 5.4 %\n% of net sales 10.4 % 11.1 %\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense 165 117 48 41.0 %\n% of net sales 3.0 % 2.4 %\nBad debt expense 9 (2) 11 550.0 %\n% of net sales 0.2 % - %\nAcquisition integration costs 7 10 (3) (30.0) %\n% of net sales 0.1 % 0.2 %\nAcquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses 4 15 (11) (73.3) %\n% of net sales 0.1 % 0.3 %\nCOVID-19 pandemic restructuring costs - 11 (11) (100.0) %\n% of net sales - % 0.2 %\nTotal selling and administrative expenses $ 748 $ 685 $ 63 9.2 %\n% of net sales 13.8 % 14.3 %\nExcluding the specific components to selling and administrative expenses listed above, the change in selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 improved as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. This is a result of the continued realization of the cost mitigation measures that were enacted in the second half of fiscal 2020 and in fiscal 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset by increased costs incurred for labor, travel and other sales support and administrative costs due to the ongoing inflationary environment and the lessening of travel restrictions from the pandemic enabling a return to conducting meetings and other business-related matters in person.\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense is higher due to the adoption of a new deferred compensation plan for certain members of non-executive management in fiscal 2022, the impact of the new stock option grants awarded in fiscal 2022 and the impact of a modification approved by the Board of Directors of the performance criteria for the fiscal 2021 and 2020 grants. Refer to Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.\nThe increase in bad debt expense is primarily attributable to certain non-U.S. customers and also the Russia and Ukraine conflict. The decrease in acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses is due to the lack of divestitures occurring in fiscal 2022.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $136 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $137 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The slight decrease in amortization expense of $1 million was due to the amortization expense recognized on intangible assets from the fiscal 2022 acquisition of DART being offset by sales order backlog recorded in connection with the CAC acquisition becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nInterest Expense-net. Interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium, revolving credit facility fees, finance leases and interest income. Interest expense-net increased $17 million, or 1.6%, to $1,076 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from $1,059 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in LIBOR compared to the prior year, which adversely impacted the interest expense on the approximately 15% of gross debt that is variable rate and not hedged via an interest rate swap or cap. This was partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest income, the repayment of $200 million previously drawn on the revolving credit facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the favorable impact from refinancing activities executed in fiscal 2021. The weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was 5.3%.\nRefinancing Costs. Refinancing costs of $1 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Refinancing costs of $37 million recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 were primarily related to fees incurred on the early redemption of the 6.50% senior subordinated notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes) and the 6.50% senior subordinated notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes) that occurred in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2021.\nOther Expense (Income). Other expense (income) was $18 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $(51) million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Other expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by a pension settlement charge of approximately $22 million for the Esterline Retirement Plan. Refer to Note 13, Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. Partially offsetting this expense was the non-service related components of net periodic benefit costs on the Company's defined benefit pension plans ($3 million). Other income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily driven by $24 million recorded for the settlement of the insurance claim for Leach International Europes Niort, France operating facility fire in August 2019. This primarily represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the carrying value of the damaged fixed assets and inventory and proceeds from the business interruption settlement. The remaining $27 million is primarily driven by non-service related components of net periodic benefit income on the Company's defined benefit pension plans ($14 million), receipt of payment of Canadian governmental subsidies ($7 million) and the release of a litigation reserve ($3 million).\nGain on Sale of Businesses-net. Gain on sale of businesses-net of $7 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and is primarily driven by cash proceeds received from a final working capital settlement for the ScioTeq and TREALITY divestiture ($3 million). Gain on sale of businesses-net of $69 million was recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and is primarily related to the net gain on sale recognized on the ScioTeq and TREALITY and TAC divestitures. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.\nIncome Tax Provision. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 23.2% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 4.8% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The Companys significantly lower effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to a one time benefit from a tax election made on the Company's fiscal 2020 U.S. federal income tax return enabling the Company to utilize its net interest deduction limitation carryforward pursuant to IRC Section 163(j) resulting in the release of the valuation allowance applicable to such carryforward during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 was $1 million, which was driven by cash proceeds received during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from a final working capital settlement for the Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies (Souriau-Sunbank) divestiture. There was no income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 23, Discontinued Operations, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.\nNet Income Attributable to TD Group. Net income attributable to TD Group increased $186 million, or 27.4%, to $866 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to net income attributable to TD Group of $680 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of the factors referenced above.\nEarnings per Share. Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and discontinued operations were $13.38 and $0.02, respectively, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $10.41 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. There was no impact on earnings per share from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Net income attributable to TD Group for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 of $866 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $86 million, or $1.47 per share, resulting in net income applicable to TD Group common stockholders of $780 million, or $13.40 per share. Net income attributable to TD Group for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 of $680 million was decreased by dividend equivalent payments of $73 million, or $1.24 per share, resulting in net income applicable to TD Group common stockholders of $607 million, or $10.41 per share.\nBusiness Segments\nSegment Net Sales. Net sales by segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 % of Net Sales 2021 % of Net Sales Change % Change\nPower & Control $ 2,873 52.9 % $ 2,550 53.1 % $ 323 12.7 %\nAirframe 2,391 44.1 % 2,083 43.5 % 308 14.8 %\nNon-aviation 165 3.0 % 165 3.4 % - - %\nNet sales $ 5,429 100.0 % $ 4,798 100.0 % $ 631 13.2 %\nNet sales for the Power & Control segment increased $323 million, an increase of 12.7%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The sales increase resulted primarily from increases in organic sales in commercial aftermarket ($241 million, an increase of 43.5%) and commercial OEM ($83 million, an increase of 18.7%); partially offset by a decrease in organic defense sales ($28 million, a decrease of 1.9%). The increase in commercial aftermarket sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in commercial air travel demand, particularly the increase in the utilization of narrow-body aircraft, and air cargo demand and the resulting higher flight hours compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in commercial OEM sales is primarily attributable to a higher volume of narrow-body aircraft deliveries by aircraft manufacturers to airlines and also production rate increases of narrow-body aircraft compared to fiscal 2021. Partially offsetting the commercial OEM sales growth are wide-body aircraft production and delivery slowdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacting international travel particularly in the first half of fiscal 2022 and also due to Boeing's ongoing regulatory and quality challenges with the 737 MAX aircraft (particularly in China) and the 787 aircraft. The decrease in defense sales is attributable to continued supply chain shortages resulting in shipment delays and delays in U.S. government defense spend outlays. The change in acquisition and divestiture sales was not material.\nNet sales for the Airframe segment increased $308 million, an increase of 14.8%, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The sales increase resulted primarily from increases in organic sales in commercial aftermarket ($237 million, an increase of 46.2%) and commercial OEM ($138 million, an increase of 29.3%); partially offset by a decrease in organic defense sales ($23 million, a decrease of 2.6%). The increase in commercial aftermarket sales is primarily attributable to the continued recovery in commercial air travel demand, particularly the increase in the utilization of narrow-body aircraft, and air cargo demand and the resulting higher flight hours compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in commercial OEM sales is primarily attributable to a higher volume of narrow-body aircraft deliveries by aircraft manufacturers to airlines and also production rate increases of narrow-body aircraft compared to fiscal 2021. Partially offsetting the commercial OEM sales growth are wide-body aircraft production and delivery slowdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacting international travel particularly in the first half of fiscal 2022 and also due to Boeing's ongoing regulatory and quality challenges with the 737 MAX aircraft (particularly in China) and the 787 aircraft. The decrease in defense sales is attributable to continued supply chain shortages resulting in shipment delays and delays in U.S. government defense spend outlays. Acquisition and divestiture sales decreased $52 million primarily due to the divestitures completed during fiscal 2021, partially offset by the impact of CAC's sales being included in acquisition and divestiture sales through the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and DART's sales beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe change in Non-aviation net sales compared to the prior fiscal year was not material.\nEBITDA As Defined. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this discussion and analysis for additional information and limitations regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure. EBITDA As Defined by segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (amounts in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 % of Segment\nNet Sales 2021 % of Segment\nNet Sales Change % Change\nPower & Control $ 1,531 53.3 % $ 1,319 51.7 % $ 212 16.1 %\nAirframe 1,121 46.9 % 878 42.2 % 243 27.7 %\nNon-aviation 65 39.4 % 62 37.6 % 3 4.8 %\nTotal segment EBITDA As Defined 2,717 50.0 % 2,259 47.1 % 458 20.3 %\nLess: Unallocated corporate expenses 71 1.3 % (1)\n70 1.5 % (1)\n1 1.4 %\nTotal Company EBITDA As Defined $ 2,646 48.7 % (1)\n$ 2,189 45.6 % (1)\n$ 457 20.9 %\n(1)Calculated as a percentage of consolidated net sales.\nOrganic EBITDA As Defined represents EBITDA As Defined from existing businesses owned by the Company as of September 30, 2022, excluding EBITDA As Defined from acquisitions and divestitures. EBITDA As Defined from acquisitions and divestitures represents EBITDA As Defined from acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to the respective acquisition date and from businesses up to the date the respective divestiture was completed. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on the Company's recent acquisition and divestiture activity.\nEBITDA As Defined for the Power & Control segment increased approximately $212 million, an increase of 16.1%, resulting from higher organic sales, particularly in the commercial aftermarket and OEM channels. Also contributing to the increase in EBITDA As Defined was the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume despite the ongoing inflationary environment for freight, labor and certain raw materials. The change in EBITDA As Defined for the Power & Control segment from acquisitions and divestitures was not material for fiscal 2022.\nEBITDA As Defined for the Airframe segment increased approximately $243 million, an increase of 27.7%, resulting primarily from higher organic sales, particularly in the commercial aftermarket and OEM channels. Also contributing to the increase in EBITDA As Defined was the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume despite the ongoing inflationary environment for freight, labor and certain raw materials. EBITDA As Defined for the Airframe segment from acquisitions and divestitures decreased by $9 million, primarily due to the impact on the comparable period from the divestitures completed in fiscal year 2021, partially offset by the impact of CAC (only through the first quarter of fiscal 2022) and DART (beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022).\nThe change in Non-aviation EBITDA as Defined compared to the prior fiscal year was not material.\nCorporate expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits, professional services and other administrative costs incurred by the corporate offices. An immaterial amount of corporate expenses is allocated to the operating segments. The change in corporate expenses compared to the prior fiscal year was not material.\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2020\nFor our results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020, refer to the discussion in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 16, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. We vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. We expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt.\nThe following tables present selected balance sheet, cash flow and other financial data relevant to the liquidity or capital resources of the Company for the periods specified below (amounts in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nSelected Balance Sheet Data:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,001 $ 4,787\nWorking capital (Total current assets less total current liabilities) 4,223 5,367\nTotal assets 18,107 19,315\nTotal debt (1)\n19,795 19,998\nTD Group stockholders deficit (3,773) (2,916)\n(1)Includes debt issuance costs and original issue discount and premiums. Reference Note 12, Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nSelected Cash Flow and Other Financial Data:\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 948 $ 913\nInvesting activities (553) (785)\nFinancing activities (2,148) (70)\nCapital expenditures 119 105\nRatio of earnings to fixed charges (1)\n2.0x 1.7x\n(1)For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium and the interest component of rental expense.\nIf the Company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and a special dividend payment. In the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 1,490,413 shares of common stock at an average price of $612.13 per share, aggregating to approximately $912 million in repurchases. In August 2022, TransDigm's Board of Directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of $18.50 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on vested options outstanding under its stock incentive plans. The total cash payment of the special dividend, using existing cash on hand, was approximately $1,045 million. Whether the Company undertakes additional share repurchases, special dividends or other aforementioned activities in fiscal 2023 will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.\nThe Companys ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the Companys indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the Companys ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company is continuing to strategically manage the Companys cash and cash equivalents in response to the ongoing inflationary environment, COVID-19 pandemic and related uncertainty of the duration and impact on the Companys business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 9 and Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption Agreement (herein, Amendment No. 9) to the Credit Agreement, increasing the capacity under the revolving credit facility from $760 million to $810 million. The Company also repaid $200 million previously drawn on the revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2021, due to favorable market conditions in the high yield bond market, the Company refinanced $1,950 million of its senior subordinated notes resulting in a reduced interest rate (estimated $35 million reduction in annual interest payments) and an extended maturity date.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below (in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,001\nAvailability on revolving credit facility 779\nCash liquidity $ 3,780\nWe believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements. We expect to meet our short-term cash liquidity requirements (including interest obligations and capital expenditures) through net cash from operating activities, cash on hand and, if needed, draws on the revolving credit facility. Long-term cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our long-term debt agreements. There is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until August 2024.\nIn connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs. We believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business acquisitions, such as the DART acquisition completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 for $359 million, pay dividends to our shareholders and make opportunistic investments in our own stock, subject to any restrictions in our existing credit agreement and market conditions.\nThe Company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so. In addition, the Company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for common stock repurchases or dividends. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.\nOperating Activities. The Company generated $948 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2022 compared to $913 million during fiscal 2021.\nThe change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2022 was a use of cash of $190 million compared to a use of cash of $78 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in the use of cash of $112 million is primarily attributable to the timing of cash receipts as there were higher sales in the month of September 2022 compared to September 2021. The Company continues to actively manage its accounts receivable, the related agings and collection efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict.\nThe change in inventories during fiscal 2022 was a use of cash of $134 million compared to a source of cash of $79 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in the use of cash of $213 million is primarily driven by increased purchasing from higher demand in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 as raw material inventory is up approximately $109 million compared to at September 30, 2021. The Company continues to actively and strategically manage inventory levels in response to the pandemic and the ongoing supply chain challenges.\nThe change in accounts payable during fiscal 2022 was a source of cash of $58 million compared to a source of cash of $3 million in fiscal 2021. The change is primarily due to increased inventory purchases and the related timing of payments to suppliers.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $553 million during fiscal 2022, consisting of the acquisitions of DART and certain product line acquisitions made by our Extant Aerospace subsidiary for a total of $437 million and capital expenditures of $119 million. This was slightly offset by $3 million in proceeds received from the final working capital settlement for the ScioTeq and TREALITY divestiture. The Company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023 to be approximately 2% to 3% of net sales, which is consistent with its historical annual spend as a percentage of net sales. The Companys capital expenditures incurred from year-to-year are funded using existing cash on hand and are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers).\nNet cash used in investing activities was $785 million during fiscal 2021, consisting primarily of the acquisition of CAC for $963 million and capital expenditures of $105 million. This was partially offset by proceeds of $259 million from the completion of the divestiture of certain businesses and $24 million of insurance proceeds received from the Leach International Europe fire property claim.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $2,148 million during fiscal 2022. The use of cash was primarily attributable to $1,091 million of dividends and dividend equivalent payments, $912 million in common stock repurchases, the $200 million repayment of a previous draw on the revolving commitments and repayment on term loans of $75 million. This was partially offset by $132 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $70 million during fiscal 2021. The use of cash was primarily attributable to the redemption of the 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes for $1,220 million and $762 million, respectively, repayments on term loans of $75 million and dividend equivalent payments of $73 million. This was partially offset by $1,189 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 4.625% senior subordinated notes due 2029 (the 4.625% 2029 Notes) offering, $743 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 4.875% senior subordinated notes due 2029 (the 4.875% 2029 Notes) offering and $128 million in proceeds from stock option exercises.\nDescription of Senior Secured Term Loans and Indentures\nSenior Secured Term Loans Facility\nTransDigm has $7,298 million in fully drawn term loans (the Term Loans Facility) and an $810 million revolving credit facility. The Term Loans Facility consists of three tranches of term loans as follows (aggregate principal amount disclosed is as of September 30, 2022):\nTerm Loans Facility Aggregate Principal Maturity Date Interest Rate\nTranche E $2,155 million May 30, 2025 LIBOR plus 2.25%\nTranche F $3,418 million December 9, 2025 LIBOR plus 2.25%\nTranche G $1,725 million August 22, 2024 LIBOR plus 2.25%\nThe Term Loans Facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of $19 million. The revolving commitments consist of two tranches which include up to $152 million of multicurrency revolving commitments. At September 30, 2022, the Company had $31 million in letters of credit outstanding and $779 million in borrowings available under the revolving commitments. Draws on the revolving commitments are subject to an interest rate of 2.50% per annum. The unused portion of the revolving commitments is subject to a fee of 0.5% per annum.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Agreement are, at TransDigms option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent agreed to by each relevant lender, nine or twelve-month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The adjusted LIBOR related to Tranche E, Tranche F and Tranche G term loans are not subject to a floor. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the applicable interest rates for all existing tranches (which excludes the impact of our interest rate swaps and caps) were 5.92% and 2.33%, respectively, with the increase due to higher LIBOR particularly in the second half of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, for information about how our interest rate swaps and cap agreements are used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility.\nFiscal 2022 Amendment to the Credit Agreement\nOn December 29, 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 9 and Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption Agreement (herein, Amendment No. 9) to the Credit Agreement, which increases the capacity under the revolving credit facility from $760 million to $810 million. The terms and conditions that apply to Amendment No. 9 are the same as the terms and conditions that apply to the existing dollar revolving commitments and term loans under the Credit Agreement.\nIndentures\nThe following table represents the senior subordinated and secured notes outstanding as of September 30, 2022:\nDescription Aggregate Principal Maturity Date Interest Rate\n2025 Secured Notes $1,100 million December 15, 2025 8.00%\n2026 Secured Notes $4,400 million March 15, 2026 6.25%\n6.875% 2026 Notes $500 million May 15, 2026 6.875%\n6.375% 2026 Notes $950 million June 15, 2026 6.375%\n7.50% 2027 Notes $550 million March 15, 2027 7.50%\n5.50% 2027 Notes $2,650 million November 15, 2027 5.50%\n4.625% 2029 Notes $1,200 million July 15, 2029 4.625%\n4.875% 2029 Notes $750 million October 15, 2029 4.875%\nThe 6.375% 2026 Notes, the 7.50% 2027 Notes, the 5.50% 2027 Notes, the 4.625% 2029 Notes and the 4.875% 2029 Notes (collectively, the TransDigm Inc. Notes) were issued at a price of 100% of the principal amount. The 6.875% 2026 Notes (the TransDigm UK Notes and together with the TransDigm Inc. Notes, the Notes, are further described below) offered in May 2018 were issued at a price of 99.24% of the principal amount, resulting in gross proceeds of $496 million. The 2025 Secured Notes were issued at a price 100% of the principal amount. The initial $3,800 million offering of the 2026 Secured Notes (which, along with the 2025 Secured Notes, are collectively referred to as the Secured Notes) was issued at a price of 100% of its principal amount and the subsequent $200 million and $400 million offerings of the 2026 Secured Notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and the third quarter of fiscal 2020, respectively, were issued at a price of 101% of their principal amount, resulting in gross proceeds of $4,411 million.\nThe Notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity. Interest under the Notes is payable semi-annually. The Notes represent our unsecured obligations ranking subordinate to our senior debt, as defined in the applicable indentures. The Notes contain many of the restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement. TransDigm is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Notes.\nGuarantor Information\nThe Notes are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt, rank equally with all of our existing and future senior subordinated debt and rank senior to all of our future debt that is expressly subordinated to the Notes.

The Secured Notes contain many of the restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement. TransDigm is in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Secured Notes.\nSeparate financial statements of TransDigm Inc. are not presented because the Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by TD Group, TransDigm UK and all of TransDigm Inc.'s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries. TD Group has no significant operations or assets separate from its investment in TransDigm Inc.\nSeparate financial statements of TransDigm UK are not presented because TransDigm UK's 6.875% 2026 Notes, issued in May 2018, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.'s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries. TD Group has no significant operations or assets separate from its investment in TransDigm Inc.\nThe financial information presented is that of TD Group and the Guarantors, which includes TransDigm Inc. and TransDigm UK, on a combined basis and the financial information of non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded. Intercompany balances and transactions between TD Group and Guarantors have been eliminated, and amounts due from, amounts due to, and transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately.\n(in millions) September 30, 2022\nCurrent assets $ 3,954\nGoodwill 6,849\nOther non-current assets 2,843\nCurrent liabilities 735\nNon-current liabilities 20,077\nAmounts (from) due to subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net (1,334)\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) September 30, 2022\nNet sales $ 4,208\nSales to subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors 50\nCost of sales 1,724\nExpense from subsidiaries that are non-issuers and non-guarantors - net 69\nIncome from continuing operations 552\nNet income attributable to TD Group 552\nCertain Restrictive Covenants in Our Debt Documents\nThe Credit Agreement and the Indentures governing the Notes and Secured Notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment of special dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances, and prepayments of certain other indebtedness.\nThe restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement are subject to amendments executed periodically. The most recent amendment that impacted the restrictive covenants contained in the Credit Agreement is Amendment No. 7.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, TransDigm is entitled, on one or more occasions, to request additional term loans or additional revolving commitments to the extent that the existing or new lenders agree to provide such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments provided that, among other conditions, our consolidated net leverage ratio would be no greater than 7.25x and the consolidated secured net debt ratio would be no greater than 5.00x, in each case, after giving effect to such incremental term loans or additional revolving commitments.\nIf any such default occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of the Notes and Secured Notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Credit Agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder and the holders of the Secured Notes will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash, and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes.\nWith the exception of the revolving credit facility, the Company has no maintenance covenants in its existing term loan and indenture agreements. Under the Credit Agreement, if the usage of the revolving credit facility exceeds 35%, or $284 million, of the total revolving commitments, the Company is required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt to trailing four-quarter EBITDA As Defined of 7.25x as of the last day of the fiscal quarter.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in subsequent periods.\nTrade Receivable Securitization Facility\nDuring fiscal 2014, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility). The Securitization Facility effectively increases the Companys borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations trade accounts receivable. The Securitization Facility includes the right for the Company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. The Company uses the proceeds from the Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs.\nOn July 25, 2022, the Company amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to July 25, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.30%, compared to an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.20% that applied prior to the amendment. The Securitization Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys domestic operations trade accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has borrowed $350 million under the Securitization Facility, which is fully drawn. At September 30, 2022, the applicable interest rate was 3.84%.\nDividend and Dividend Equivalent Payments\nOn August 26, 2022, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $18.50 on each outstanding share of common stock. No dividends were declared or paid during fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, the Company paid approximately $86 million in dividend equivalent payments. Total cash payments related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in fiscal 2022 and 2021 were approximately $1,091 million and $73 million, respectively. Refer to Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements herein for further information on the Companys dividend equivalent payments.\nAny future declaration of special cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions under the Credit Agreement and Indentures, the availability of surplus under Delaware law and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. TD Group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries. Unless TD Group receives dividends, distributions, advances, transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries, TD Group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future. The ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our Term Loans Facility and Indentures and may be limited by future debt or other agreements that we may enter into.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes the Companys cash requirements from all significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2022 (in millions):\nTotal Payment Due by Period\nContractual Less than Between Between Over\nObligations 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years\nSenior subordinated and secured notes (1)\n$ 12,100 $ - $ - $ 7,500 $ 4,600\nTerm Loans Facility (2)\n7,298 75 3,910 3,313 -\nScheduled interest payments (3)\n4,273 1,177 2,126 780 190\nPension funding minimums (4)\n127 12 24 25 66\nSecuritization Facility 350 350 - - -\nFinance leases 294 12 26 26 230\nOperating leases 113 21 34 23 35\nTotal contractual cash obligations $ 24,555 $ 1,647 $ 6,120 $ 11,667 $ 5,121\n(1)Represents principal maturities which excludes interest, debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premiums.\n(2)The Tranche G term loans mature in August 2024, the Tranche E term loans mature in May 2025 and the Tranche F term loans mature in December 2025. The Term Loans Facility requires quarterly aggregate principal payments of $19 million.\n(3)Assumes that the variable interest rate on our Tranche E, Tranche F and Tranche G term loans under our Term Loans Facility range from approximately 5.82% to 7.21% based on anticipated movements in the LIBOR, which given the ongoing volatility in rates, are highly uncertain. In addition, interest payments include the impact of the existing interest rate swap and cap agreements described in Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\n(4)Represents future benefit payments expected to be paid from the pension and post-retirement benefit plans or from the Companys assets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations. Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $31 million in letters of credit outstanding.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nBelow are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional significant accounting policies, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer, which is demonstrated by our right to payment, a transfer of title, a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership, or the customer acceptance, but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods. The majority of the Company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. Because the Company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. Where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. Additionally, management believes that the Companys estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable and material changes in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate our estimate is unlikely. However, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. A 10% change in our excess and obsolete inventory reserve at September 30, 2022 would not have a material impact on our results. In accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. We determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Fair value adjustments to the Companys assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition.\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Companys intent to do so. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.\nU.S. GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units have been identified at the operating unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.\nAt the time of goodwill impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit. For the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. If the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. The use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates are set by using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology. The WACC methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. The Company utilizes a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the WACC. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.\nManagement, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.\nManagement tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. Management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. In this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. The key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the WACC methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts. Management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.\nThe discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.\nThe Company had 47 reporting units with goodwill and 44 reporting units with indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the date of the annual impairment test. Based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units, the Company identified 13 reporting units to test for impairment using a quantitative test for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The 13 reporting units selected for quantitative testing have higher commercial aerospace content and, as a result, have been more adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated fair values of each of these reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on certain company-specific projected data, specifically earnings before taxes and net sales, which are significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value. With a ten percentage point decrease in earnings before taxes and net sales data, all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nStock-Based Compensation - The cost of the Companys stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. The Company uses a Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the Companys common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the Companys dividend yield. The Company primarily utilizes historical data in determining the assumptions. An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of managements control could, and do, have an impact on the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data. The total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. Changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. The Company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of ASC 718. If determined to be a modification, the Black-Scholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catch-up to expense.\nIncome Taxes - The Company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. To the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. Historically, such adjustments have not been significant.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor information about new accounting standards, see Note 4, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present below certain financial information based on our EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined. References to EBITDA mean earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to EBITDA As Defined mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of income from continuing operations to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined presented below.\nNeither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. We present EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity.\nOur management believes that EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts, investors, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a companys ability to incur and service debt. In addition, EBITDA As Defined is useful to investors because the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance under certain circumstances, on a pro forma basis, with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our Consolidated EBITDA defined in the same manner as we define EBITDA As Defined herein.\nIn addition to the above, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections. Moreover, our management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions.\nAlthough we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nneither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;\nthe omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;\nneither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and\nEBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or EBITDA As Defined in isolation and specifically by using other U.S. GAAP measures, such as net income, net sales and operating profit, to measure our operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nIncome from continuing operations $ 866 $ 681\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization expense 253 253\nInterest expense, net 1,076 1,059\nIncome tax provision 261 34\nEBITDA 2,456 2,027\nAdjustments:\nInventory acquisition accounting adjustments (1)\n3 6\nAcquisition integration costs (2)\n11 14\nAcquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses (3)\n4 15\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense (4)\n184 130\nRefinancing costs (5)\n1 37\nCOVID-19 pandemic restructuring costs (6)\n- 40\nGain on sale of businesses, net (7)\n(7) (69)\nOther, net (8)\n(6) (11)\nEBITDA As Defined $ 2,646 $ 2,189\n(1)\nRepresents accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when inventory was sold.\n(2)\nRepresents costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into TD Groups operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs.\n(3)\nRepresents transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees, legal, financial and tax due diligence expenses, and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred.\n(4)\nRepresents the compensation expense recognized by TD Group under our stock incentive plans and deferred compensation plans.\n(5)\nRepresents costs expensed related to debt financing activities, including new issuances, extinguishments, refinancings and amendments to existing agreements.\n(6)\nRepresents restructuring costs related to the Company's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic of $36 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk is principally our variable rate debt. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for the remaining tenors of USD LIBOR (one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2023. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) as the recommended risk-free reference rate for the U.S. (calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities), we cannot currently predict the extent to which this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates.\nIn February 2020, in connection with Amendment No. 7 to the Credit Agreement, we amended our Credit Agreement to include a provision for the determination of an alternative reference interest rate. Additionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we have elected the LIBOR protocols issued by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, but the discontinuation of LIBOR may also require our derivative agreements to be amended in some way. Once the alternative interest rate has replaced LIBOR, our future interest expense could be impacted. We will continue to evaluate the risks and opportunities related to LIBOR transition.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had borrowings under our Term Loans Facility, which consists of three tranches of term loans, of approximately $7,298 million that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our term loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the Companys cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans. The Company's objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75% fixed rate and 25% variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. Interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2022, approximately 85% of our total debt was fixed rate. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately $74 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2022. The weighted average interest rate on the $7,298 million of borrowings under our Term Loans Facility on September 30, 2022 was 6.3%.\nFor information about the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans and the fair value of the Notes, refer to Note 20, Fair Value Measurements, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nForeign Currency Risk\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, primarily the British pound and the euro. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact business could materially adversely affect our net sales, net income and the carrying values of our assets located outside the U.S. global economic uncertainty continues to exist. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates, and are used to offset changes in the fair value of certain assets or liabilities or forecasted cash flows resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into by the Company are described in Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nA 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have resulted in a material impact to net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nAs disclosed elsewhere in this report, the future impacts of the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic and their residual effects, including economic uncertainty, inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain, labor markets and aerospace industry, on our business remain uncertain. As we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe information required by this Item is contained on pages through of this Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2022, TD Group carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of TD Groups management, including its President, Chief Executive Officer and Director (Principal Executive Officer) and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of TD Groups disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the President, Chief Executive Officer and Director and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that TD Groups disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by TD Group in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to TD Groups management, including its President, Chief Executive Officer and Director and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, TD Groups management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in designing and evaluating the controls and procedures.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of TD Group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Using criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, TransDigms management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of DART. The Company is currently integrating the acquisition into its operations, compliance programs and internal control processes. As permitted by SEC rules and regulations, the Company has excluded the acquisition from management's evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. The acquisition constituted approximately 2% of the Company's total assets (inclusive of acquired intangible assets) as of September 30, 2022 and approximately 1% and 0% of the Company's net sales and income from continuing operations before income taxes, respectively, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nTransDigm Group Incorporated\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited TransDigm Group Incorporateds internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, TransDigm Group Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of DART Aerospace (DART), which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 2% of total assets as of September 30, 2022 and 1% and 0% of net sales and income from continuing operations before income taxes, respectively, for the fiscal year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of DART.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated November 10, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nCleveland, Ohio\nNovember 10, 2022 ITEM 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 10, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nDescription of the Matter\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $8.6 billion and $990 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce fair value below carrying value. The Companys goodwill is initially assigned to its reporting units as of the acquisition date. The Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of acquired trademarks and trade names. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines the qualitative assessment is not sufficient to conclude on whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The Company performed a quantitative assessment on the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at 13 of its reporting units. As part of the quantitative assessment, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow valuation model.\nAuditing managements quantitative impairment assessment was complex and judgmental for certain of the 13 reporting units and their indefinite-lived intangible assets due to the significant estimation required to determine fair value. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate, revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys impairment process, including controls over managements review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions underlying the fair value determination, as described above.\nTo test the fair values of the Companys reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and underlying data used by the Company in its analyses for certain of the 13 reporting units and their indefinite-lived intangible assets evaluated using the quantitative assessment. We utilized internal valuation specialists in assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions selected by management in the determination of the fair values of certain of the 13 reporting units and their indefinite-lived intangible assets. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, and other relevant factors. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in fair values that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2004.\nCleveland, Ohio\nNovember 10, 2022\nTRANSDIGM GROUP INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Amounts in millions, except share amounts)\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,001 $ 4,787\nTrade accounts receivable-Net 967 791\nInventories-Net 1,332 1,185\nPrepaid expenses and other 349 267\nTotal current assets 5,649 7,030\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT-NET 807 770\nGOODWILL 8,641 8,568\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS-NET 2,750 2,791\nOTHER 260 156\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 18,107 $ 19,315\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 76 $ 277\nShort-term borrowings-trade receivable securitization facility 350 349\nAccounts payable 279 227\nAccrued and other current liabilities 721 810\nTotal current liabilities 1,426 1,663\nLONG-TERM DEBT 19,369 19,372\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES 596 485\nOTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 482 705\nTotal liabilities 21,873 22,225\nTD GROUP STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT:\nCommon stock -

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nTD Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, TransDigm Inc., is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly every commercial and military aircraft in service today. TransDigm Inc., along with TransDigm Inc.s direct and indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries (collectively, with TD Group, the Company or TransDigm), offers a broad range of proprietary aerospace products. TD Group has no significant assets or operations other than its 100% ownership of TransDigm Inc. TD Groups common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the trading symbol TDG.\nTransDigm's major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.\n2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nAcquisitions\nDART Aerospace - On March 14, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding stock of DART Aerospace (DART) for a total purchase price of $359 million, which is net of a working capital settlement received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of approximately $1 million. The acquisition was completed on May 25, 2022 and financed through existing cash on hand. DART operates from four primary facilities (Hawkesbury, Ontario, Canada; Portland, Oregon; Fort Collins, Colorado and Chihuahua, Mexico) and is a leading provider of highly engineered, unique helicopter mission equipment solutions that predominantly service civilian aircraft. The products are primarily proprietary with significant aftermarket content. DART's operating results are included within TransDigm's Airframe segment.\nThe Company accounted for the DART acquisition using the acquisition method and included the results of operations of the acquisition in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition. The Company made an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As of September 30, 2022, the measurement period (not to exceed one year) is open; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the DART acquisition are subject to adjustment until the end of the respective measurement period. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and will likely change in future periods, perhaps materially, as fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalized, including those related to deferred taxes and income taxes. The Company is in the process of finalizing a third-party valuation of certain intangible assets and tangible assets of DART. The fair values of acquired intangibles are determined based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could differ from future economic and market conditions. Pro forma net sales and results of operations for the acquisition had it occurred at the beginning of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021 are not material and, accordingly, are not provided.\nThe allocation of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the DART acquisition as of the May 25, 2022 acquisition date is summarized in the table below (in millions):\nPreliminary Measurement Period Adjusted Preliminary\nAllocation Adjustments (2)\nAllocation\nAssets acquired (excluding cash):\nTrade accounts receivable $ 16 $ (1) $ 15\nInventories 33 - 33\nPrepaid expenses and other 4 1 5\nProperty, plant and equipment 9 - 9\nGoodwill 236 (34) 202 (1)\nOther intangible assets 112 36 148 (1)\nOther 8 - 8\nTotal assets acquired (excluding cash) 418 2 420\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable 4 - 4\nAccrued and other current liabilities 11 2 13\nDeferred income taxes 35 1 36\nOther non-current liabilities 8 - 8\nTotal liabilities assumed 58 3 61\nNet assets acquired $ 360 $ (1) $ 359\n(1)The Company expects that none of the approximately $202 million of goodwill and $148 million of other intangible assets recognized for the acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.\n(2)Measurement period adjustments primarily related to the adjustments in the fair values of the acquired other intangible assets from the third-party valuation. The offset was to goodwill.\nExtant Aerospace Acquisitions - For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company's Extant Aerospace subsidiary, which is included in TransDigms Power & Control segment, completed a series of acquisitions of substantially all of the assets and technical data rights of certain product lines, each meeting the definition of a business, for a total purchase price of $88 million, of which $78 million was paid via existing cash on hand and $10 million was accrued as a component of accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The allocation of the purchase prices is preliminary and will likely change in future periods as fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are finalized. The Company expects that all of the approximately $57 million of goodwill and all of the approximately $37 million of other intangible assets recognized for the acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes over 15 years. Pro forma net sales and results of operations for the acquisitions, had they occurred at the beginning of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021, are not material and, accordingly, are not provided. Acquisitions completed by the Companys Extant Aerospace subsidiary in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were not material.\nCobham Aero Connectivity - On November 24, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding stock of Chelton Limited, Chelton Avionics Holdings, Inc. and Mastsystem Int'l Oy, collectively, Cobham Aero Connectivity (CAC), for a total purchase price of $945 million. The acquisition was substantially completed on January 5, 2021 and financed through existing cash on hand. The Company completed the remainder of the acquisition of CAC on February 12, 2021, also through existing cash on hand. CAC operates from two primary facilities (Marlow, United Kingdom and Prescott, Arizona) and is a leading provider of highly engineered antennas and radios for the aerospace end market. The products are primarily proprietary with significant aftermarket content and have a strong presence across major defense platforms as well as select commercial applications. CAC's operating results are included within TransDigm's Airframe segment.\nThe Company accounted for the CAC acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and third-party valuation appraisals and included the results of operations of the acquisition in its consolidated financial statements from the effective dates of the acquisition. The total purchase price of CAC was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the respective fair value at the dates of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, such excess was allocated to goodwill. The fair values of acquired intangibles and certain liabilities, such as loss contract reserves, are determined based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair values of acquired intangible assets include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of the loss contract reserves using the discounted cash flow model include discount rates and forecasted costs to be incurred under the long-term contracts and at-market bid prices for respective contracts. These assumptions are forward looking and could differ from future economic and market conditions.\nThe final allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CAC acquisition as of the acquisition dates, as well as measurement period adjustments recorded within the permissible one year measurement period, are summarized in the table below (in millions):\nPreliminary Measurement Period Final\nAllocation Adjustments (2)\nAllocation\nAssets acquired (excluding cash):\nTrade accounts receivable $ 31 $ 1 $ 32\nInventories 27 2 29\nPrepaid expenses and other 10 (3) 7\nProperty, plant and equipment 18 3 21\nGoodwill 636 61 697 (1)\nOther intangible assets 309 15 324 (1)\nOther 34 (3) 31\nTotal assets acquired (excluding cash) 1,065 76 1,141\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable 15 3 18\nAccrued and other current liabilities 38 6 44\nDeferred income taxes 38 (7) 31\nOther non-current liabilities 29 74 103\nTotal liabilities assumed 120 76 196\nNet assets acquired $ 945 $ - $ 945\n(1)Of the approximately $697 million of goodwill recognized for the acquisition, approximately $65 million is deductible for tax purposes. Of the approximately $324 million of other intangible assets recognized for the acquisition, approximately $105 million is deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill and other intangible assets are deductible over 15 years.\n(2)Primarily relates to the recording of loss contract reserves within accrued and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities associated with acquired ongoing long-term contracts with customers that were incurring negative gross margins as of the date of acquisition. The offset was to goodwill. Based on our review of these contracts, we concluded that the terms of certain contracts were unfavorable when compared to market terms as of the acquisition date. The loss contract reserves, totaling $80.6 million, will be released over an estimated three to five year period. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, $52.1 million and $75.7 million remains reserved for.\nThe acquisitions completed by the Company strengthen and expand the Companys position to design, produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components in niche markets with significant aftermarket content and provide opportunities to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers). The purchase price paid reflect the current EBITDA and cash flows, as well as the future EBITDA and cash flows expected to be generated by the businesses, which are driven in most cases by the recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of a particular aircraft, estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years.\nDivestitures\nScioTeq and TREALITY Simulation Visual Systems - On June 30, 2021, TransDigm completed the divestiture of its ScioTeq and TREALITY Simulation Visual Systems businesses (ScioTeq and TREALITY) to OpenGate Capital (OpenGate) for approximately $200 million in cash. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company determined ScioTeq and TREALITY met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. ScioTeq and TREALITY were acquired by TransDigm as part of its acquisition of Esterline Technologies Corporation (Esterline) in March 2019 and were included in TransDigms Airframe segment.\nTechnical Airborne Components - On April 27, 2021, TransDigm completed the divestiture of the Technical Airborne Components business (TAC) to Searchlight Capital Partners for approximately $40 million in cash. TAC was included in TransDigms Airframe segment.\nThe net gain on sale recognized in fiscal 2021 as a result of the ScioTeq and TREALITY and TAC divestitures was approximately $68 million, which was classified as a component of gain on sale of businesses-net within the consolidated statements of income. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company received approximately $3 million in cash proceeds related to a final working capital settlement for the ScioTeq and TREALITY divestiture. These proceeds are classified as a component of gain on sale of businesses-net in the consolidated statements of income.\nRacal Acoustics - On January 29, 2021, TransDigm completed the divestiture of the Racal Acoustics business (Racal) to Invisio Communications AB for approximately $20 million in cash. Racal was acquired by TransDigm as part of its acquisition of Esterline in March 2019 and was included in TransDigm's Non-aviation segment. The gain on sale recognized in fiscal 2021 as a result of the divestiture is not material and was classified as a component of gain on sale of businesses-net in the consolidated statements of income.\nAvista, Inc. - On November 17, 2020, TransDigm completed the divestiture of the Avista, Inc. business (Avista) to Belcan, LLC for approximately $8 million in cash. Avista was acquired by TransDigm as part of its acquisition of Esterline in March 2019 and was included in TransDigm's Airframe segment. The gain on sale recognized in fiscal 2021 as a result of the divestiture was not material and is classified as a component of gain on sale of businesses-net in the consolidated statements of income.\nSouriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies - On December 20, 2019, TransDigm completed the divestiture of the Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies business (Souriau-Sunbank) to Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton) for approximately $920 million. Souriau-Sunbank was acquired by TransDigm as part of its acquisition of Esterline in March 2019 and was included in TransDigm's Non-aviation segment. Refer to Note 23, Discontinued Operations for additional information.\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of TD Group and subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications within the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation, none of which are material.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer, which is demonstrated by our right to payment, a transfer of title, a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership, or the customer acceptance, but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods. The majority of the Company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. Refer to Note 5, Revenue Recognition, for further details.\nShipping and Handling Costs - Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.\nResearch and Development Costs - The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred and classifies such amounts in selling and administrative expenses. The expense recognized for research and development costs for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $94.9 million, $105.6 million, and $130.9 million, respectively.\nCash Equivalents-The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - The Company's allowance for credit losses is the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The allowance for uncollectible accounts reduces the trade accounts receivable balance to the estimated net realizable value equal to the amount that is expected to be collected. The Companys method for developing its allowance for credit losses is based on historical write-off experience, the aging of receivables, an assessment of the creditworthiness of customers, economic conditions and other external market information. The allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. All provisions for allowances for uncollectible accounts are included in selling and administrative expenses. The determination of the amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is subject to judgment and estimation by management. If circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate or improve, the allowance for uncollectible accounts could increase or decrease. Refer to Note 7, Trade Accounts Receivable, for further information.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory is made based on managements analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts. Refer to Note 8, Inventories, for further details.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements from 10 to 20 years, buildings and improvements from 5 to 30 years, machinery and equipment from 2 to 10 years and furniture and fixtures from 3 to 10 years. Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur. Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred. Amortization expense of assets accounted for as finance leases is included within depreciation expense.\nProperty, plant and equipment is assessed for potential impairment whenever indicators of impairment are present by determining whether the carrying value of the property can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations over the propertys remaining estimated useful life. Any impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Refer to Note 9, Property, Plant and Equipment, for further details.\nDebt Issuance Costs, Premiums and Discounts - The cost of obtaining financing as well as premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective obligations as a component of interest expense within the consolidated statements of income. Debt issuance costs are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liabilities. Refer to Note 12, Debt, for further details.\nFinancial Instruments - Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate borrowings under our credit facility. The interest rate swap and cap agreements utilized by the Company effectively modify the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Companys variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis through the expiration date of the interest rate swap and cap agreements, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate volatility on future interest expense. These agreements involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the term of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These derivative instruments qualify as effective cash flow hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company transacts business in various foreign currencies, which subjects the Companys cash flows and results of operations to exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures arise primarily from purchases or sales of products and services from third parties. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates, and are used to offset changes in the fair value of certain assets or liabilities or forecasted cash flows resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\nFor the interest rate swap and cap agreements and the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instruments is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders deficit and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affected earnings. As the interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk, any gains or losses from the derivative instruments that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in interest expense-net in the consolidated statements of income. As the foreign currency forward exchange contracts are used to manage foreign currency exposure primarily arising from sales to third parties, any gains or losses from the derivative instruments that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in net sales in the consolidated statements of income. The cash flows from settled contracts are recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, for further details.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed will impact the determination of future operating results. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. We determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Fair value adjustments to the Companys assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition. Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the Companys intent to do so.\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets of a business acquired. Other intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles acquired or recognized in accounting for the acquisitions (trademarks, trade names, technology, customer relationships, order backlog and other intangible assets). Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives (i.e., trademarks and trade names) are subject to annual impairment testing. Management determines fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques. The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce fair value below carrying value.\nAt the time of goodwill impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, and whether it is therefore necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after considering all events and circumstances that support a qualitative evaluation the Company determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, then performing the single-step quantitative analysis to determine if there is impairment would be unnecessary. Conversely, if it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, then the Company would proceed with the single-step quantitative analysis to determine if there is a goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss. In this application, the definition of more-likely-than-not is interpreted as a likelihood of more than 50%.\nU.S. GAAP requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units have been identified at the operating unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. With respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.\nThe impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between their fair values and carrying values. If the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the sum of any such excesses.\nThe Company had 47 reporting units with goodwill and 44 reporting units with indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the date of the annual impairment test. Based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units, the Company identified 13 reporting units to test for impairment using a quantitative test for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The 13 reporting units selected for quantitative testing have higher commercial aerospace content and, as a result, have been more adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated fair values of each of these reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis on certain company-specific projected data, specifically earnings before taxes and net sales, which are significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value. With a ten percentage point decrease in earnings before taxes and net sales data, all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result of the impairment testing performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter, no indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill was determined to be impaired. As economic and market conditions have not changed significantly since the first day of the fourth quarter, this conclusion remains appropriate as of September 30, 2022.\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of its amortizable intangible assets only when indicators of impairment are present by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected, undiscounted cash flows from future operations over their remaining lives. Amortization of amortizable intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: technology from 20 to 22 years, order backlog from 1 to 1.5 years, customer relationships over 20 years and other intangible assets over 20 years. No indicators of impairment on the amortizable intangible assets were identified in fiscal 2022.\nStock-Based Compensation - The Company records stock-based compensation expense using the Black-Scholes pricing model based on certain valuation assumptions. Compensation expense is recorded over the vesting periods of the stock options, adjusted for expected forfeitures. The Company has classified stock-based compensation primarily within selling and administrative expenses to correspond with the classification of employees that receive stock option grants. The Company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of ASC 718. If determined to be a modification, the Black-Scholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catch up to expense, if necessary. Refer to Note 18, Stock-Based Compensation, for further information.\nIncome Taxes - The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes and for certain changes in valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce certain deferred tax assets when, in our estimation, it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize uncertain tax positions when we have determined it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. However, new information may become available, or applicable laws or regulations may change, thereby resulting in a favorable or unfavorable adjustment to amounts recorded. Refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, for further information.\nEstimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nComprehensive Income (Loss) - The term comprehensive income (loss) represents the change in stockholders equity (deficit) from transactions and other events and circumstances resulting from non-stockholder sources. The Companys accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, consisting principally of fair value adjustments to its interest rate swap and cap agreements (net of tax), cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and pension liability adjustments (net of tax), is reported separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions - The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenue and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized currently in income and those resulting from translation of financial statements, including gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are accumulated as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) for the period. Foreign currency (gains) or losses recognized in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of income from changes in exchange rates were ($39.7) million, $10.9 million and $22.0 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEarnings per Share - Earnings per share information is determined using the two-class method, which includes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and other securities that participate in cash dividends (participating securities). Our vested stock options are considered participating securities because they include non-forfeitable rights to cash dividends. In applying the two-class method, earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on their respective weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share information may include the additional effect of other securities, if dilutive, in which case the dilutive effect of such securities is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contingently issuable shares are not included in earnings per share until the period in which the contingency is satisfied. Refer to Note 6, Earnings Per Share, for further information.\nPension Benefits - The Company accounts for net periodic pension benefit cost (income) using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date. Management selects appropriate assumptions including the discount rate, rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumptions are based upon historical results, the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events. Actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and accordingly, are recognized in expense in these periods. Significant differences between the assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation. Refer to Note 13, Retirement Plans, for further information.\n4. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on October 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform.\" Certain amendments were provided for in ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (ASC 848): Scope, which was issued in January 2021. This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease potential accounting impacts associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The amendments in this ASU apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments in this ASU are effective through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact of reference rate reform on our existing Credit Agreement and our interest rate swap and cap agreements. To the extent that, prior to December 31, 2022, the Company enters into any transactions for which the optional practical expedients permissible under ASC 848 are applied, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company continues to monitor for future amendments, such as the current proposal by the FASB to defer the sunset date of reference rate reform relief to December 31, 2024.\n5. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nTransDigm's sales are concentrated in the aerospace and defense industry. The Companys customers include: distributors of aerospace components, commercial airlines, large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft OEMs, various armed forces of the United States and friendly foreign governments, defense OEMs, system suppliers, and various other industrial customers.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is recorded at a point in time. Revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer, which is demonstrated by our right to payment, a transfer of title, a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership, or the customer acceptance, but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods.\nIn some contracts, control transfers to the customer over time, primarily in contracts where the customer is required to pay for the cost of both the finished and unfinished goods at the time of cancellation plus a reasonable profit relative to the work performed for products that were customized for the customer. Therefore, we recognize revenue over time for those agreements that have a right to margin and where the products being produced have no alternative use.\nBased on our production cycle, it is generally expected that goods related to the revenue will be shipped and billed within the current year. For revenue recognized over time, we estimate the amount of revenue attributable to a contract earned at a given point during the production cycle based on certain costs, such as materials and labor incurred to date, plus the expected profit, which is a cost-to-cost input method.\nWe consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.\nWhen contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification to an existing contract on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively.\nThe Companys payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. The Company does not offer any payment terms that would meet the requirements for consideration as a significant financing component.\nShipping and handling fees and costs incurred in connection with products sold are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income, and are not considered a performance obligation to our customers.\nThe Company pays sales commissions that relate to contracts for products or services that are satisfied at a point in time or over a period of one year or less and are expensed as incurred. These costs are reported as a component of selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of the Companys net sales.\nNet sales to foreign customers, primarily in Western Europe, Canada and Asia, were $1.9 billion during the fiscal year ended 2022 and $1.7 billion during the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nContract Assets and Liabilities - Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing or reimbursable costs related to a specific contract. Contract liabilities (Deferred revenue) relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. The following table summarizes our contract assets and liabilities balances (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nContract assets, current (1)\n$ 119 $ 70\nContract assets, non-current (2)\n1 2\nTotal contract assets 120 72\nContract liabilities, current (3)\n45 25\nContract liabilities, non-current (4)\n9 5\nTotal contract liabilities 54 30\nNet contract assets $ 66 $ 42\n(1)Included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)Included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3)Included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(4)Included in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe increase in the Company's total contract assets during fiscal 2022 primarily is due to the timing and status of work in process and/or milestones of certain contracts. The increase in the Company's total contract liabilities during fiscal 2022 primarily is due to the receipt of advance payments as well as the contract liabilities of DART, which was acquired in May 2022.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the revenue recognized that was previously included in contract liabilities was not material.\nRefer to Note 17, Segments, for disclosures related to the disaggregation of revenue.\n6. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share data) using the two-class method:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNumerator for earnings per share:\nIncome from continuing operations $ 866 $ 681 $ 653\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1) (1) (1)\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to TD Group 865 680 652\nLess: Dividends paid on participating securities (86) (73) (185)\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax 1 - 47\nNet income applicable to TD Group common stockholders-basic and diluted $ 780 $ 607 $ 514\nDenominator for basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding 54.8 54.8 53.9\nVested options deemed participating securities 3.4 3.6 3.4\nTotal shares for basic and diluted earnings per share 58.2 58.4 57.3\nEarnings per share from continuing operations-basic and diluted $ 13.38 $ 10.41 $ 8.14\nEarnings per share from discontinued operations-basic and diluted 0.02 - 0.82\nEarnings per share $ 13.40 $ 10.41 $ 8.96\n7. TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nTrade accounts receivable consist of the following (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nTrade accounts receivable-gross $ 1,002 $ 821\nAllowance for uncollectible accounts (35) (30)\nTrade accounts receivable-Net $ 967 $ 791\nAt September 30, 2022, one customer individually accounted for approximately 10% of the Companys trade accounts receivable-gross. In addition, approximately 40% of the Companys trade accounts receivable-gross was due from entities that operate principally outside of the United States - primarily in Western Europe, Canada and Asia. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of each customers financial condition and collateral is generally not required.\nThe increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is primarily related to an increase in the estimate for credit losses on accounts receivable for certain non-U.S. customers and certain customers impacted by the Russia and Ukraine conflict.

The terms and conditions that apply to Amendment No. 9 are the same as the terms and conditions that apply to the existing dollar revolving commitments and term loans under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company capitalized $0.2 million representing debt issuance costs associated with Amendment No. 9 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nTrade Receivable Securitization Facility\nThe Companys trade receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility) effectively increases the Companys borrowing capacity depending on the amount of the domestic operations trade accounts receivable. The Securitization Facility includes the right for the Company to exercise annual one year extensions as long as there have been no termination events as defined by the agreement. The Company uses the proceeds from the Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing borrowing costs.\nOn July 25, 2022, the Company amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to July 25, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of SOFR plus 1.30%, compared to the interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.20% that applied prior to the amendment. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has borrowed $350 million under the Securitization Facility, which is fully drawn. At September 30, 2022, the applicable interest rate was 3.84%. The Securitization Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Companys domestic operations trade accounts receivable.\nGovernment Refundable Advances\nGovernment refundable advances consist of payments received from the Canadian government to assist in research and development related to commercial aviation. The requirement to repay this advance is based on year-over-year commercial aviation revenue growth for certain product lines at CMC Electronics, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransDigm. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balance of these advances were $23 million and $29 million, respectively.\nObligations under Finance Leases\nThe Company leases certain buildings and equipment under finance leases. The present value of the minimum finance lease payments, net of the current portion, represents a balance of $146 million and $100 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2022 is attributable to certain lease renewals and amendments qualifying as lease modifications resulting in a change in classification from an operating lease to a finance lease. Refer to Note 19, Leases, for further disclosure of the Companys lease obligations.\nSenior Secured Term Loans Facility\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, TransDigm had $7,298 million and $7,374 million in fully drawn term loans (the Term Loans Facility) and $810 million in revolving commitments, of which $779 million and $529 million was available to the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, subject to an interest rate of 2.50% per annum. The unused portion of the revolving commitments is subject to a fee of 0.5% per annum. The increase in available revolving commitments is due to the Companys October 2021 repayment of $200 million from a previous draw. The Term Loans Facility consists of three tranches of term loans as follows (in millions):\nTerm Loans Facility Maturity Date Interest Rate Aggregate Principal as of September 30,\n2022 2021\nTranche E May 30, 2025 LIBOR plus 2.25% $ 2,155 $ 2,177\nTranche F December 9, 2025 LIBOR plus 2.25% $ 3,418 $ 3,454\nTranche G August 22, 2024 LIBOR plus 2.25% $ 1,725 $ 1,743\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Agreement are, at TransDigms option, equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR for one, two, three or six-month (or to the extent agreed to by each relevant lender, nine or twelve-month) interest periods chosen by TransDigm, in each case plus an applicable margin percentage. The adjusted LIBOR related to Tranche E, Tranche F and Tranche G term loans are not subject to a floor. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the applicable interest rates for all existing tranches (which excludes the impact of our interest rate swaps and caps) were 5.92% and 2.33%, respectively, with the increase due to higher LIBOR particularly in the second half of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 21, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, for information about how our interest rate swaps and cap agreements are used to hedge and offset, respectively, the variable interest rates on the credit facility.\nRefinancing Costs\nRefinancing costs were not material in fiscal 2022. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company expensed refinancing costs of $37 million, primarily representing the early redemption premium paid in connection with the repurchase of the $1,200 million 6.50% senior subordinated notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes) and $750 million 6.50% senior subordinated notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes), and also the execution of Amendment No. 8 and Loan Modification Agreement. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company expensed refinancing costs of $28 million primarily representing the early redemption premium paid in connection with the repurchase of the $1,150 million 6.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), and also the execution of Amendment No. 7 and the Refinancing Facility Agreement.\nSecured Notes\nTransDigm Inc.s 2025 Secured Notes and 2026 Secured Notes (collectively, the Secured Notes) jointly and severally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by TD Group, TransDigm UK and all of TransDigm Inc.'s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the applicable Indentures. The Secured Notes contain many of the restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement.

Notes are referred to collectively as the Notes) are jointly and severally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by TD Group, TransDigm Inc. and all of TransDigm Inc.'s Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the applicable Indenture. The Notes contain many of the restrictive covenants included in the Credit Agreement. TransDigm is in compliance with all the covenants contained in the Notes.\nDebt Repayment Schedule\nAt September 30, 2022, future maturities of long-term debt (including finance leases) are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2023 $ 77\n2024 1,770\n2025 2,150\n2026 10,269\n2027 557\nThereafter 4,744\nTotal $ 19,567\n13. RETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains certain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans (collectively, referred to as the pension plans) covering eligible employees in the U.S. and in other certain countries such as Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. These defined benefit plans generally provide benefits to employees based on formulas recognizing length of service and earnings. The Companys funding policy is to contribute actuarial-determined amounts allowable under tax and statutory regulations for the qualified plans. The Company uses a September 30th measurement date for its defined benefit pension plans. The Company also sponsors other post-retirement pension plans for its employees in the U.S. and in Canada (collectively, referred to as the post-retirement pension plans). Other post-retirement pension plans are non-contributory health care and life insurance plans.\nNet periodic pension benefit cost (income) for the pension plans at the end of each fiscal year consisted of the following (in millions):\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\n2022 2021 2020\nU.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans\nService cost $ - $ 3 $ 2 $ 5 $ 9 $ 6\nInterest cost 4 4 6 5 10 5\nExpected return on plan assets (6) (7) (19) (7) (19) (8)\nAmortization of net loss - 1 1 2 1 1\nCurtailment/settlements loss (gain) (1)\n22 - - (2) (1) (1)\nNet periodic pension benefit cost (income) $ 20 $ 1 $ (10) $ 3 $ - $ 3\n(1)Effective June 30, 2021, the Company terminated the Esterline Technologies Retirement Plan (the ERP) in accordance with IRS regulations. Pension obligations were distributed through a combination of lump sum payments to eligible plan participants and the purchase of a group annuity contract. Approximately $107 million in lump sum payments (using existing plan assets) were made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company transferred the remaining benefit obligations of approximately $188 million to an insurance company in order to purchase a group annuity contract which began paying plan benefits in September 2022. The Company made a final cash contribution of approximately $16 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of the group annuity purchase. A settlement charge of approximately $22 million, which included $6 million in unrecognized actuarial losses previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, was recorded as a component of other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2022.\nNet periodic pension benefit cost for the post-retirement pension plans was less than $1 million for each of the fiscal years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020. The components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and accumulated other comprehensive income for defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans at September 30, 2022 and 2021, were as follows (in millions):\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans Post-Retirement Pension Plans\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nU.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans U.S. Pension Plans Non-U.S. Pension Plans\nBenefit Obligations\nBeginning balance $ 351 $ 224 $ 366 $ 248 $ 2 $ 12 $ 1 $ 14\nCurrency translation adjustment - (21) - 10 - (1) - 1\nService cost - 3 2 5 - - - 1\nInterest cost 4 4 6 5 - - - -\nPlan participant contributions - - - 1 - - - -\nActuarial gain (30) (53) - (11) - (2) - (3)\nCurtailments - - - (4) - - - -\nSettlements (295) - (8) (1) - - - -\nDivestitures - - - (20) - - - -\nOther adjustments - - 1 - - - 1 -\nBenefits paid (15) (9) (16) (9) - (1) - (1)\nEnding balance $ 15 $ 148 $ 351 $ 224 $ 2 $ 8 $ 2 $ 12\nPlan Assets - Fair Value\nBeginning balance $ 341 $ 206 $ 342 $ 204 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCurrency translation adjustment - (18) - 9 - - - -\nRealized and unrealized (loss) gain on plan assets (39) (49) 22 14 - - - -\nPlan participant contributions - - - 1 - - - -\nCompany contributions 17 3 - 8 - 1 - 1\nSettlements (295) - (8) (1) - - - -\nDivestitures - - - (20) - - - -\nOther adjustments - - 1 - - - - -\nBenefits paid (15) (9) (16) (9) - (1) - (1)\nEnding balance $ 9 $ 133 $ 341 $ 206 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nFunded Status\nFair value of plan assets $ 9 $ 133 $ 341 $ 206 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nBenefit obligations (15) (148) (351) (224) (2) (8) (2) (12)\nNet amount recognized $ (6) $ (15) $ (10) $ (18) $ (2) $ (8) $ (2) $ (12)\nAmount Recognized on Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOther assets $ - $ 6 $ - $ 6 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nAccrued and other current liabilities (1) (1) (3) - - (1) - (1)\nOther non-current liabilities (5) (20) (7) (24) (2) (7) (2) (11)\nNet amount recognized $ (6) $ (15) $ (10) $ (18) $ (2) $ (8) $ (2) $ (12)\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (Income)\nNet loss (gain) $ 3 $ 12 $ 10 $ 14 $ (1) $ (4) $ (1) $ (2)\nPrior service cost - 2 1 1 1 - 1 -\nEnding balance $ 3 $ 14 $ 11 $ 15 $ - $ (4) $ - $ (2)\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $157.8 million and $567.8 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The decrease to the accumulated benefit obligation during the current year primarily relates to the settlement of the ERP.\nEstimated future benefit payments expected to be paid from the pension and post-retirement pension plans or from the Companys assets are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2023 $ 12\n2024 12\n2025 12\n2026 12\n2027 13\n2028 - 2032 66\nThere is an expected funding requirement of $2.1 million in fiscal 2023 for the non-U.S. pension plans maintained by the Company. There is no expected funding requirement in fiscal 2023 for the U.S. pension plans.\nU.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans\nPrincipal assumptions as of year end 2022 2021 2022 2021\nDiscount rate 4.29% 2.56% 4.90% 2.40%\nRate of increase in future compensation levels N/A (1)\nN/A (1)\n3.38% 3.06%\nAssumed long-term rate of return on plan assets 2.64% 5.74% 3.55% 3.20%\n(1)As a result of the plan freeze to the ERP for all future benefit accruals and participation by new or rehired employees on or after January 1, 2021, the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels was not applicable as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, as pay increases are not valued once a defined benefit pension plan is frozen. The ERP settlement occurred in fiscal 2022.\nU.S. Post-Retirement Pension Plans Non-U.S. Post-Retirement Pension Plans\nPrincipal assumptions as of year end 2022 2021 2022 2021\nDiscount rate 3.94% 2.36% 5.06% 2.87%\nInitial weighted average health care trend rate 6.00% 7.30% 5.60% 5.70%\nUltimate weighted average health care trend rate 6.00% 6.00% 4.20% 4.20%\nThe Company uses discount rates developed from a yield curve established from high-quality corporate bonds and matched to plan-specific projected benefit payments. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points, pension liabilities in total would have decreased $1.1 million or increased $8.4 million, respectively. Had the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points, fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit cost for the pension plans would have increased $1.8 million or $2.1 million, respectively. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on the defined benefit pension plans assets, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of investments, the asset allocation, and expectations of future investment strategies. Had the expected return on assets increased or decreased by 25 basis points, fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit cost would have increased $1.4 million or $2.5 million, respectively. Management is not aware of any legislative or other initiatives or circumstances that will significantly impact the Companys pension obligations in fiscal 2023.\nPlan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and debt securities consisting primarily of common stocks, bonds and government securities. The objective of these investments is to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund current benefit payments and achieve targeted risk-adjusted returns. Management periodically reviews allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluates external sources of information regarding the long-term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type.\nAllocations by investment type are as follows:\nActual\nPlan assets allocation as of fiscal year end: Target 2022 2021\nReturn-seeking assets (e.g., equity securities and real estate) 35%-70%\n42.0% 20.7%\nFixed-income securities (e.g., debt securities) 30%- 65%\n57.6% 78.3%\nCash -%\n0.4% 1.0%\nTotal 100.0% 100.0%\nDue to the freeze and subsequent termination of the ERP that occurred during fiscal 2021, management approved changes to the Plans investment policy to align our pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an investment strategy of approximately 85% to 95% in fixed-income securities and up to approximately 20% in return-seeking assets, consisting of primarily equity securities and real estate. Once the settlement of the ERP occurred, the targets were revised to be in line with those used prior to the termination of the ERP.\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Companys pension plan assets as of September 30, 2022, by asset category segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 20, Fair Value Measurements (in millions):\nFair Value Hierarchy\nLevel 1 Level 2 Total\nInvestments measured at fair value by category: (5)\nReturn-seeking assets: (1)\nU.S. equity securities $ 4 $ - $ 4\nNon-U.S. equity securities 21 - 21\nFixed-income securities: (2)\nNon-U.S. foreign commercial and government bonds - 41 41\nCash and cash equivalents (3)\n1 - 1\n$ 26 $ 41 $ 67\nInvestments measured at net asset value by category: (4)\nReturn-seeking assets: (1)\nCommingled trust funds - Non-U.S. securities 27\nNon-U.S. equity securities 7\nFixed-income securities: (2)\nU.S corporate bonds 2\nNon-U.S. corporate bonds 18\nNon-U.S. foreign commercial and government bonds 21\nTotal $ 142\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Companys pension plan assets as of September 30, 2021, by asset category segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 20, Fair Value Measurements (in millions):\nFair Value Hierarchy\nLevel 1 Level 2 Total\nInvestments measured at fair value by category: (5)\nReturn-seeking assets: (1)\nU.S. equity securities $ 6 $ - $ 6\nNon-U.S. equity securities 34 - 34\nFixed-income securities: (2)\nNon-U.S. foreign commercial and government bonds - 53 53\nCash and cash equivalents (3)\n5 - 5\n$ 45 $ 53 $ 98\nInvestments measured at net asset value by category: (4)\nReturn-seeking assets: (1)\nCommingled trust funds - Non-U.S. securities 65\nNon-U.S. equity securities 9\nFixed-income securities: (2)\nU.S. government bonds and securities 91\nU.S corporate bonds 223\nNon-U.S. corporate bonds 20\nNon-U.S. foreign commercial and government bonds 41\nTotal $ 547\n(1) Level 1 return-seeking assets, which are primarily equity securities and real estate, are actively traded on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and are either valued using the market approach at quoted market prices on the measurement date or at the net asset value of the shares held by the plan on the measurement date based on quoted market prices.\n(2) Level 2 fixed-income securities, which are primarily debt securities, are primarily valued using the market approach at either quoted market prices, pricing models that use observable market data, or bids provided by independent investment brokerage firms.\n(3) Cash and cash equivalents include cash which is used to pay benefits and cash invested in a short-term investment fund that holds securities with values based on quoted market prices, but for which the funds are not valued on quoted market basis.\n(4) These investments are valued at the net asset value (NAV) of units held. The NAV is used to estimate fair value and is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less its liability.\n(5) No investments measured using Level 3 inputs.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company sponsors certain defined contribution employee savings plans that cover substantially all of the Companys U.S. employees. Under certain plans, the Company contributes a percentage of employee compensation and matches a portion of employee contributions. The cost recognized for such contributions for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $30.2 million, $28.3 million and $25.3 million, respectively.\n14. INCOME TAXES\nThe Companys income from continuing operations before income taxes includes the following components for the periods shown below (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nUnited States $ 882 $ 516 $ 635\nForeign 245 199 105\n$ 1,127 $ 715 $ 740\nThe Companys income tax provision (benefit) on income from continuing operations consists of the following for the periods shown below (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrent\nFederal $ 194 $ (21) $ 26\nState 27 14 3\nForeign 62 7 34\n283 - 63\nDeferred\nFederal (17) 7 29\nState (8) (2) 3\nForeign 3 29 (8)\n(22) 34 24\n$ 261 $ 34 $ 87\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the periods shown below is as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nFederal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nChanges in valuation allowances impacting results (1)\n5.5 % (8.2) % 4.2 %\nFederal deemed inclusion amounts 1.5 % 1.7 % 0.4 %\nWithholding taxes 1.2 % 0.2 % 0.3 %\nGain on sale of businesses (0.1) % 1.4 % - %\nResolution and settlements to uncertain tax positions (0.1) % (3.2) % (0.3) %\nResearch and development credits (0.6) % (1.2) % (0.6) %\nForeign tax credits (0.8) % (1.2) % (0.6) %\nProvision to return adjustments (1.0) % 2.2 % (0.4) %\nForeign-derived intangible income (2.0) % (1.5) % (2.8) %\nStock-based compensation (2.8) % (8.7) % (10.7) %\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to enacted statutory rate changes - % 2.1 % 0.4 %\nOther-net 1.4 % 0.2 % 0.9 %\nEffective income tax rate 23.2 % 4.8 % 11.8 %\n(1) Primarily relates to the Companys business interest expense limitation pursuant to IRC \u00a7163(j) as modified by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Such provision, as modified, was effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. In general, the deduction for interest expense is limited to 30% (50% as modified by the CARES Act for the Companys fiscal 2020 and 2021) of the sum of the Companys adjusted taxable income (ATI) and its business interest income. Interest expense disallowed by such limitation, in a taxable year, may be carried forward indefinitely. Based upon available evidence, a valuation allowance is recorded for the resulting carryforward to reflect the Companys belief that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In fiscal 2021, the Company made a tax election on its U.S. federal income tax return allowing for the utilization of its net interest limitation carryforward. The Company recognized approximately $69.0 million of benefit from the release of the valuation allowance, applicable to such carryforward, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe components of the deferred taxes consist of the following (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities):\nIntangible assets $ (832) $ (814)\nInterest rate swaps and caps (42) 69\nProperty, plant and equipment (23) (32)\nEmployee benefits 108 107\nInterest expense limitation 87 28\nInventories 61 45\nNet operating losses 52 58\nLoss contract reserves 41 51\nU.S. income tax credits 27 31\nCapitalized research and development costs 24 -\nNon-U.S. income tax credits 14 20\nEnvironmental reserves 11 11\nProduct warranty reserves 6 7\nOther 7 8\nTotal (459) (411)\nAdd: Valuation allowance (137) (74)\nTotal net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (596) $ (485)\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,679.7 million, German net operating loss carryforwards of $28.1 million and United Kingdom net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26.6 million that expire in various fiscal years from 2023 to 2041. The Company has U.S. and non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $41.6 million that expire beginning in fiscal year 2025.\nThe deferred tax assets for the interest expense limitation, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards are reduced by a valuation allowance for the amount of such assets that the Company believes will not be realized.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for years before fiscal 2017. The Company is currently under examination for its federal income taxes in Canada for fiscal years 2013 through 2019, and in Germany for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. In addition, the Company is subject to state income tax examinations for fiscal years 2015 and later.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021\nBalance at October 1 $ 19 $ 41\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the prior year 3 -\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year - 2\nReductions based on tax positions related to the prior year (1) (18)\nSettlement with tax authorities (1) (4)\nLapse in statute of limitations (3) (2)\nBalance at September 30 $ 17 $ 19\nUnrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2022 and 2021, the recognition of which would have an effect on the effective tax rate for each fiscal year, amounted to $16.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively. The Company classifies all income tax-related interest and penalties as income tax expense, which were not significant for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company accrued $4.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, for the potential payment of interest and penalties. Within the next 12 months, the Company does not anticipate a material increase, or decrease, in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time threatened with, or may become a party to, legal actions and other proceedings. While the Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings, it believes the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nLitigation Claims - On November 1, 2021, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a derivative complaint, captioned Sciabacucchi v Howley, et al. C.A. No. 2021-0938-LWW (the Derivative Action), in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court). The complaint, which names certain directors of the Company (the Director Defendants) as defendants, alleges that the Director Defendants awarded and received excessive compensation. The Director Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, any and all allegations of wrongdoing or liability asserted in the Derivative Action.\nNonetheless, solely to eliminate the uncertainty, distraction, disruption, burden, risk and expense of further litigation, the Company and the Director Defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release (the Stipulation) with the plaintiff on August 19, 2022. Pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation, the Director Defendants have agreed to implement and maintain certain changes to the Companys compensation policies and practices such as to the extent dividend equivalent payments are declared payable to any Company director, those DEPs will not be paid in cash, but instead will be paid via a reduction to the strike price of options that are issued to that director. Other corporate governance enhancements were also agreed to by the Company. The Company is also responsible for the payment of plaintiffs attorneys fees. The proposed settlement as set forth in the Stipulation, other than the amount of the attorneys fees, was approved by the Court on November 10, 2022. The settlement (i) fully resolves the Derivative Action by dismissing all asserted claims with prejudice and (ii) releases all claims related to the allegations in the Derivative Action. The settlement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial statements.\nDOD OIG Audit - TransDigms subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries products are periodically subject to audits by the Department of Defense (DOD) Office of Inspector General (OIG) with respect to prices paid for such products. In 2019, the DOD OIG received a congressional letter requesting a comprehensive review of TransDigms contracts with the DOD from January 2017 through June 2019 to identify whether TransDigm earned excess profits. This subsequently resulted in an audit by the DOD OIG in which the objective was to determine whether TransDigms business model impacted the DODs ability to pay fair and reasonable prices for spare parts. In December 2021, the OIG completed the audit and issued the related audit report. Despite the audit report making clear there was no wrongdoing by TransDigm, its businesses, or the DOD, the report recommended that TransDigm voluntarily refund at least $20.8 million in excess profit on 150 contracts subject to the audit.\nTransDigm disagrees with many of the implications contained in the report, and objects to the use of arbitrary standards and analysis which render many areas of the report inaccurate and misleading. These include: (1) The report expressly acknowledges that it used arbitrary standards that are not applicable to the audited contracts and warns that its arbitrary standards should not be used in the future. The use of inapplicable standards results in flawed analysis and is misleading; (2) The report ignores significant real costs incurred by the business and contrary to law reports these costs as excess profit; (3) Despite data demonstrating that the DOD paid lower prices compared to the commercial prices for similar parts, the report did not conduct a price analysis and instead implies that the DOD negotiated prices were too high.\nNo loss contingency related to the voluntary refund request has been recorded as of September 30, 2022 as the Company has concluded that based on the current facts and circumstances, it's uncertain as to whether or not the requested voluntary refund will be made.\nEnvironmental Liabilities - Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees. Environmental laws and regulations may require that the Company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. Certain facilities and third-party sites utilized by the Company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws. The Company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws.\nEstimates of the Companys environmental liabilities are based on current facts, laws, regulations and technology. These estimates take into consideration the Companys prior experience and professional judgment of the Companys environmental advisors. Estimates of the Companys environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates, the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.\nAccordingly, as investigation and remediation proceed, it is likely that adjustments in the Companys accruals will be necessary to reflect new information. The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in a given period. Based on currently available information, however, the Company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.\nEnvironmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the Company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action. The Company also takes into consideration the estimated period of time in which payments will be required. The liabilities are reviewed periodically and, as investigation and remediation proceed, adjustments are made as necessary. Liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. The liabilities are not offset by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state-managed sites, third party indemnity obligations, and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites.\nThe Companys consolidated balance sheets includes current environmental remediation obligations at September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $7.9 million and $8.2 million classified as a component of accrued and other current liabilities, respectively, and non-current environmental remediation obligations at September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $38.3 million and $40.7 million classified as a component of other non-current liabilities, respectively.\nLeach International Europe (Facility Fire) - On August 8, 2019, a fire caused significant damage to the Niort, France operating facility of the Leach International Europe subsidiary, which is reported within the Companys Power & Control segment. The facility as well as certain machinery, equipment and inventory sustained damage. The Company suspended operations at the Niort facility as a result of the fire; however, had transferred certain operations to temporary facilities until operations were fully restored at the rebuilt facility. The new facility was completed in December 2020 and was fully operational as of March 2021.\nThe Companys insurance covers damage to the facility, equipment, inventory, and other assets, at replacement cost, as well as business interruption losses and other incremental costs resulting from the disruption of operations caused by the fire, subject to a $1 million deductible and certain sub-limits based on the nature of the covered item. Anticipated insurance recoveries related to losses and incremental costs incurred were recognized when receipt was probable. Anticipated insurance recoveries in excess of net book value of the damaged property and inventory were recorded once all contingencies relating to the claim had been resolved.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the insurance claim, inclusive of property, business interruption and incremental costs of working, was settled for $88 million, net of the $1 million deductible. A gain of $24 million was recorded to other income during fiscal 2021, of which $19 million represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the carrying value of the damaged fixed assets and inventory and $5 million represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of previously recorded receivables for business interruption and incremental costs of working.\nOf the approximately $58 million in cash proceeds received in fiscal 2021 relating to the insurance claim and final settlement of the claim, $24 million was included in net cash used in investing activities and $34 million was included in net cash provided by operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the insurance reimbursements. In fiscal 2020, approximately $28 million in cash proceeds was received as an initial advance under the property insurance claim. All of the proceeds received in fiscal 2020 were included in net cash provided by operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the insurance reimbursements.\n16. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nTD Group consists of 224,400,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock and 149,600,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock. The total number of shares of common stock issued at September 30, 2022 and 2021 was 60,049,685 and 59,403,100, respectively. The total number of shares held in treasury at September 30, 2022 and 2021 was 5,688,639 and 4,198,226, respectively. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at September 30, 2022 and 2021. The terms of the preferred stock have not been established.\nOccasionally at management's discretion, the Company repurchases its common stock in the open market, depending on market conditions, stock price and other factors. On November 8, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), authorized a stock repurchase program to permit repurchases of its outstanding common stock not to exceed $650 million in the aggregate (the $650 million stock repurchase program), subject to any restrictions specified in the Companys Credit Agreement and/or Indentures governing the Company's existing Notes.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company repurchased 36,900 shares of common stock at an average price of $512.67 per share, for a total amount of $19 million. The repurchased shares of common stock are classified as treasury stock in the statement of changes in stockholders' deficit. No repurchases were made during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The $650 million stock repurchase program was effective through January 26, 2022.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program to permit repurchases of its outstanding common stock not to exceed $2,200 million in the aggregate (the $2,200 million stock repurchase program), replacing the $650 million stock repurchase program previously authorized by the Board on November 8, 2017, subject to any restrictions specified in the Credit Agreement, and/or Indentures governing the Company's existing Notes. There is no expiration date for this program.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 1,490,413 shares of common stock at an average price of $612.13 per share, for a total amount of $912 million. The repurchased shares of common stock are classified as treasury stock in the statement of changes in stockholders' deficit. As of September 30, 2022, $1,288 million remains available for repurchase under the $2,200 million stock repurchase program.\n17. SEGMENTS\nThe Companys businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments: Power & Control, Airframe and Non-aviation.\nThe Power & Control segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technologies. Major product offerings include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, databus and power controls, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems. Primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.\nThe Airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market systems and components that are used in non-power airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. Major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology and parachutes. Primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers, airlines, third party maintenance suppliers, military buying agencies and repair depots. Products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels.\nThe Non-aviation segment includes operations that primarily develop, produce and market products for non-aviation markets. Major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications, mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls for space applications, hydraulic/electromechanical actuators and fuel valves for land-based gas turbines, and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries and turbine controls for the energy and oil and gas markets. Primary customers of this segment are off-road vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers, child restraint system suppliers, satellite and space system suppliers, manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries and turbine original equipment manufacturers, gas pipeline builders and electric utilities.\nThe primary measurement used by management to review and assess the operating performance of each segment is EBITDA As Defined. The Company defines EBITDA As Defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with the Companys stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, restructuring costs related to the Company's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. COVID-19 restructuring costs represented actions primarily taken by the Company in fiscal 2021 and 2020 to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand, as well as incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations (e.g., additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements, personal protective equipment). Acquisition and divestiture-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Companys operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments.\nEBITDA As Defined is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. Although the Company uses EBITDA As Defined to assess the performance of its business and for various other purposes, the use of this non-GAAP financial measure as an analytical tool has limitations, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Companys segments are reported on the same basis used internally for evaluating performance and for allocating resources. The accounting policies for each segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at values based on market prices, which creates intercompany profit on intersegment sales or transfers that is eliminated in consolidation. Intersegment sales were immaterial for the periods presented below. Corporate consists of our corporate offices. Corporate expenses consist primarily of compensation, benefits, professional services and other administrative costs incurred by the corporate offices. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Corporate expenses and assets reconcile reportable segment data to the consolidated totals. An immaterial amount of corporate expenses is allocated to the operating segments.\nThe following table presents net sales by reportable segment (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet sales to external customers\nPower & Control\nCommercial and non-aerospace OEM $ 602 $ 524 $ 623\nCommercial and non-aerospace aftermarket 846 573 673\nDefense 1,425 1,453 1,399\nTotal Power & Control 2,873 2,550 2,695\nAirframe\nCommercial and non-aerospace OEM 726 582 783\nCommercial and non-aerospace aftermarket 779 553 689\nDefense 886 948 781\nTotal Airframe 2,391 2,083 2,253\nTotal Non-aviation 165 165 155\nNet Sales $ 5,429 $ 4,798 $ 5,103\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA As Defined by segment to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nEBITDA As Defined\nPower & Control $ 1,531 $ 1,319 $ 1,345\nAirframe 1,121 878 955\nNon-aviation 65 62 54\nTotal segment EBITDA As Defined 2,717 2,259 2,354\nLess: Unallocated corporate expenses 71 70 76\nTotal Company EBITDA As Defined 2,646 2,189 2,278\nDepreciation and amortization expense 253 253 283\nInterest expense, net 1,076 1,059 1,029\nAcquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses 18 35 31\nNon-cash stock and deferred compensation expense 184 130 93\nRefinancing costs 1 37 28\nCOVID-19 pandemic restructuring costs - 40 54\nGain on sale of businesses, net (7) (69) -\nOther, net (6) (11) 20\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,127 $ 715 $ 740\nThe following table presents capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization by segment (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nCapital expenditures\nPower & Control $ 63 $ 65 $ 89\nAirframe 52 37 10\nNon-aviation 3 2 4\nCorporate 1 1 2\n$ 119 $ 105 $ 105\nDepreciation and amortization\nPower & Control $ 109 $ 107 $ 117\nAirframe 138 139 157\nNon-aviation 5 6 7\nCorporate 1 1 2\n$ 253 $ 253 $ 283\nThe following table presents total assets by segment (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nTotal assets\nPower & Control $ 6,994 $ 6,980\nAirframe 7,781 7,472\nNon-aviation 238 229\nCorporate 3,094 4,634\n$ 18,107 $ 19,315\nGeographic Area Information\nNet sales are measured based on the geographic destination of sales.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Companys equity compensation plans are designed to assist the Company in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding key employees, directors or consultants, and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders by closely aligning the interests of these individuals with those of the Companys stockholders. The Companys equity compensation plans provide for the granting of stock options.\nNon-cash stock compensation expense recognized by the Company during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $152.7 million, $128.9 million and $92.7 million, respectively. The related tax benefit for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $18.4 million, $20.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively. Of the non-cash stock compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, $150.3 million, $121.0 million and $86.8 million was recorded as a component of additional paid in capital and $2.4 million, $7.9 million and $5.9 million was recorded as a component of other non-current liabilities. The liability awards relate to stock options granted between fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2020 from the 2014 stock option plan to certain employees in lieu of these individuals receiving salary and bonus compensation paid in cash. The vesting of the stock options are subject to the achievement of the same operating performance goals as other grants. The liability is remeasured each reporting period based on the market value of our common shares on the last day of the reported period. The other non-current liabilities related to stock-based compensation as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $25.5 million and $23.1 million, respectively.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $254.21, $193.47 and $157.41, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $88.0 million, $92.0 million and $97.2 million, respectively.\nCompensation expense is recognized based upon probability assessments of awards that are expected to vest in future periods, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Such probability assessments are subject to revision and, therefore, unrecognized compensation expense is subject to future changes in estimate. As of September 30, 2022, there was approximately $204.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards expected to vest, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.\nOn November 12, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the Companys established performance criteria required to be achieved for the options granted in fiscal 2020 and in fiscal 2021 with a scheduled vesting date of September 30, 2022. This action resulted in a modification for accounting purposes under ASC 718 for the options granted in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, consisting of 239 individuals, including all of the independent directors and certain executive officers. An additional $5.1 million of stock compensation expense for fiscal 2022 resulted from this modification.\nThe fair value of the Companys employee stock options was estimated at the date of grant or modification using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for all options granted during the fiscal years ended:\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nRisk-free interest rate 1.47% to 2.97%\n0.42% to 0.86%\n0.26% to 1.65%\nExpected life of options 6.5 years\n5.5 years\n5 to 5.5 years\nExpected dividend yield of stock -\n-\n-\nExpected volatility of stock 37% to 38%\n36%\n25% to 39%\nThe risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury bond rates as of the grant date or modification date. The average expected life of stock-based awards is based on the Companys actual historical exercise experience. Expected volatility of stock was calculated using a rate based upon the historical volatility of TransDigms common stock up to the expected life of the options. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data. The total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. Changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. Notwithstanding the special cash dividends declared and paid from time to time, the Company historically has not declared and paid regular cash dividends and does not anticipate declaring and paying regular cash dividends in future periods; thus, no dividend yield assumption is used.\n2019 Stock Option Plan\nIn August 2019, the Board of Directors of TD Group adopted a new stock option plan, which was subsequently approved by stockholders on October 3, 2019. The 2019 stock option plan permits TD Group to award stock options to our key employees, directors or consultants. The total number shares of TD Group common stock reserved for issuance or delivery under the 2019 stock option plan is 4,000,000, subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, share exchange or any other similar corporate transaction or event. No grants have been made from TD Groups 2019 stock option plan as of September 30, 2022.\n2014 Stock Option Plan\nIn July 2014, the Board of Directors of TD Group adopted the 2014 stock option plan, which was subsequently approved by stockholders on October 2, 2014. The 2014 stock option plan permits TD Group to award stock options to our key employees, directors or consultants. The total number of shares of TD Group common stock reserved for issuance or delivery under the 2014 stock option plan is 5,000,000, subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or split, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, share exchange or any other similar corporate transaction or event.\nPerformance Vested Stock Options - Generally all of the options granted through September 30, 2022 under the 2014 stock option plan have been pursuant to an equity incentive program adopted by the Company in 2008. Under the 2008 equity incentive program, generally all of the options granted will vest based on the Companys achievement of established operating performance goals. The following table summarizes the activity, pricing and other information for the Companys performance vested stock-based award activity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022:\nNumber of\nOptions Weighted-Average\nExercise Price Per\nOption Weighted-Average\nRemaining\nContractual Term Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 4,202,923 $ 403.12\nGranted 547,480 637.14\nExercised (180,060) 328.14\nForfeited (262,537) 496.16\nExpired (5,100) 592.48\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 4,302,706 $ 424.54 6.5 years\n$ 533,897,229\nExpected to vest 1,138,982 $ 554.50 7.9 years\n$ 27,283,129\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 2,952,644 $ 361.43 5.8 years\n$ 506,671,180\nAt September 30, 2022, there were 346,451 remaining shares available for award under TD Groups 2014 stock option plan.\n2006 Stock Incentive Plan\nIn conjunction with the consummation of the Companys initial public offering, a 2006 stock incentive plan was adopted by TD Group. In July 2008 and March 2011, the plan was amended to increase the number of shares available for issuance thereunder. TD Group reserved 8,119,668 shares of its common stock for issuance to key employees, directors or consultants under the plan. Awards under the plan were in the form of options, restricted stock or other stock-based awards. Options granted under the plan expire no later than the tenth anniversary of the applicable date of grant of the options, and have an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock granted under the plan vested over three years. No restricted stock units remained outstanding as of September 30, 2018.\nPerformance Vested Stock Options - All of the options granted under the 2006 stock incentive plan have been pursuant to an equity incentive program adopted by the Company in 2008. Under the 2008 equity incentive program, all of the options granted vest based on the Companys achievement of established operating performance goals. The following table summarizes the activity, pricing and other information for the Companys performance vested stock-based award activity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022:\nNumber of\nOptions Weighted-Average\nExercise Price Per\nOption Weighted-Average\nRemaining\nContractual Term Aggregate\nIntrinsic Value\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 1,548,605 $ 185.71\nGranted - -\nExercised (465,620) 148.64\nForfeited - -\nExpired - -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 1,082,985 $ 193.05 2.3 years\n$ 359,303,394\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 1,082,985 $ 193.05 2.3 years\n$ 359,303,394\nThe 2006 stock incentive plan expired on March 14, 2016 and no further shares were granted under the plan thereafter.\nThe total intrinsic value of performance options exercised during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $279.4 million, $355.3 million and $394.2 million, respectively.\nDividend Equivalent Plans\nUntil August 5, 2022, pursuant to the 2014 Stock Option Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan and the Third Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan, all of the options granted under the existing stock option plans were entitled to certain dividend equivalent payments in the event of the declaration of a dividend by the Company.\nOn August 5, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted an Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Option Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan and a Fourth Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan Dividend Equivalent Plan clarifying the manner in which the Company pays dividend equivalents in cash. The amendments did not represent a change in the Companys practice. Simultaneously, all members of the Board of Directors executed amendments to their option agreements resulting in the directors no longer receiving dividend equivalent payments in cash, but rather for dividends declared after July 27, 2022 (including the $18.50 per share special dividend declared and paid in August 2022), dividends will result in a reduction of strike price on the outstanding options held by the directors.\nDividend equivalent payments on vested options were $85.7 million, $72.5 million and $184.9 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At September 30, 2022, there was $38.6 million recorded in accrued and other current liabilities and $22.2 million accrued in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets related to future dividend equivalent payments.\n19. LEASES\nThe Company leases certain manufacturing facilities, offices, land, equipment and vehicles. Such leases, some of which are noncancellable and, in many cases, include renewals, expire at various dates. Such options to renew are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The Companys lease agreements typically do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants, and payments within certain lease agreements are adjusted periodically for changes in an index or rate.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The discount rate implicit within our leases is generally not determinable and therefore we determine the discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate for our leases is determined based on the lease term and the currency in which lease payments are made. The length of a lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. The Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Additionally, when accounting for leases, the Company combines payments for leased assets, related services and other components of a lease.\nThe components of lease expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\nClassification 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost Cost of sales or selling and administrative expenses $ 24 $ 29\nFinance lease cost\nAmortization of leased assets Cost of sales 6 4\nInterest on lease liabilities Interest expense - net 9 6\nTotal lease cost $ 39 $ 39\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases $ 24 $ 29\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases 8 6\nFinancing cash outflows from finance leases 2 2\nLease assets obtained in exchange for new lease obligations:\nOperating leases $ 21 $ 41\nFinancing leases 51 25\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows (in millions):\nClassification September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets Other assets $ 85 $ 94\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Accrued and other current liabilities 18 20\nLong-term operating lease liabilities Other non-current liabilities 71 79\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 89 $ 99\nFinance Leases\nFinance lease right-of-use assets, net Property, plant and equipment - net $ 137 $ 104\nCurrent finance lease liabilities Current portion of long-term debt 2 2\nLong-term finance lease liabilities Long-term debt 144 98\nTotal finance lease liabilities $ 146 $ 100\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has the following remaining lease term and weighted average discount rates:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\nOperating leases 7.8 years\nFinance leases 20.0 years\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases 5.9%\nFinance leases 7.1%\nMaturities of lease liabilities at September 30, 2022 are as follows (in millions):\nOperating Leases Finance Leases\n2023 $ 21 $ 12\n2024 18 13\n2025 16 13\n2026 12 13\n2027 11 13\nThereafter 35 230\nTotal future minimum lease payments 113 294\nLess: imputed interest 24 148\nPresent value of lease liabilities reported $ 89 $ 146\n20. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nLevel Carrying\nAmount Fair Value Carrying\nAmount Fair Value\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents 1 $ 3,001 $ 3,001 $ 4,787 $ 4,787\nInterest rate cap agreements (1)\n2 50 50 8 8\nInterest rate swap agreements (1)\n2 77 77 - -\nInterest rate swap agreements (2)\n2 68 68 - -\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swap agreements (3)\n2 - - 100 100\nInterest rate swap agreements (4)\n2 - - 180 180\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts (3)\n2 11 11 4 4\nShort-term borrowings - trade receivable securitization facility (4)\n2 350 350 349 349\nLong-term debt, including current portion:\nTerm loans (5)\n2 7,256 6,976 7,318 7,268\nRevolving credit facility (5)\n2 - - 200 200\n2025 Secured Notes (5)\n1 1,094 1,115 1,093 1,170\n6.375% 2026 Notes (5)\n1 946 884 945 981\n6.875% 2026 Notes (5)\n1 495 473 494 527\n2026 Secured Notes (5)\n1 4,368 4,257 4,359 4,593\n7.50% 2027 Notes (5)\n1 547 524 546 578\n5.50% 2027 Notes (5)\n1 2,635 2,286 2,632 2,730\n4.625% 2029 Notes (5)\n1 1,191 966 1,190 1,196\n4.875% 2029 Notes (5)\n1 744 606 743 751\nGovernment refundable advances 2 23 23 29 29\nFinance lease obligations 2 146 146 100 100\n(1)Included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)Included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3)Included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(4)Included in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(5)The carrying amount of the debt instrument is presented net of the debt issuance costs, premium and discount. Refer to Note 12, Debt, for gross carrying amounts.\nThe Company values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information are generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. No financial instruments were recognized or disclosed using unobservable inputs (i.e., Level 3).\nInterest rate swaps were measured at fair value using quoted market prices for the swap interest rate indexes over the term of the swap discounted to present value versus the fixed rate of the contract. The interest rate caps were measured at fair value using implied volatility rates of each individual caplet and the yield curve for the related periods.\nThe Companys derivative contracts consist of foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap and cap agreements. These derivative contracts are over-the-counter, and their fair value is determined using modeling techniques that include market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and currency exchange rates. These contracts are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe estimated fair value of the Companys term loans was based on information provided by the agent under the Companys senior secured credit facility. The estimated fair values of the Companys notes were based upon quoted market prices. There has not been any impact to the fair value of derivative liabilities due to the Company's own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of derivative assets based on the Company's evaluation of counterparties' credit risks.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable-net and accounts payable approximated carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\n21. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company is exposed to, among other things, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in the normal course of business. The Companys risk management program is designed to manage the exposure and volatility arising from these risks, and utilizes derivative financial instruments to offset a portion of these risks. The Company uses derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to hedge identified business risks and does not enter into such transactions for trading purposes. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security with counterparties to these financial instruments and is therefore subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance; however, the Company monitors credit risk and currently does not anticipate nonperformance by other parties. These derivative financial instruments do not subject the Company to undue risk, as gains and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities, or anticipated transactions that are being hedged. The Company has agreements with each of its swap and cap counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company defaults on the credit facility the Company could also be declared in default on its swaps and caps, resulting in an acceleration of payment under the swaps and caps.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. For a derivative that has not been designated as an accounting hedge, the change in the fair value is recognized immediately through earnings. For a derivative that has been designated as an accounting hedge of an existing asset or liability (a fair value hedge), the change in the fair value of both the derivative and underlying asset or liability is recognized immediately through earnings. For a derivative designated as an accounting hedge of an anticipated transaction (a cash flow hedge), the change in the fair value is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent the derivative is effective in mitigating the exposure related to the anticipated transaction. The change in the fair value related to the ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss is reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings.\nInterest Rate Swap and Cap Agreements - Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floating-rate borrowings under our credit facility. The interest rate swap and cap agreements utilized by the Company effectively modify the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Companys floating-rate debt to a fixed rate basis through the expiration date of the interest rate swap and cap agreements, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These agreements involve the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the term of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These derivative instruments qualify as effective cash flow hedges under U.S. GAAP. For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instruments was initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders deficit and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same line as the hedged item in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affected earnings. As the interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk, any gains or losses from the derivative instruments that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in interest expense-net in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys interest rate swap agreements:\nAggregate Notional Amount (in millions) Start Date End Date Conversion of Related Variable Rate Debt to\nFixed Rate of:\n$500 6/29/2018 3/31/2025 5.25% (3.0% plus the 2.25% margin percentage)\n$1,500 6/30/2022 3/31/2025 5.35% (3.1% plus the 2.25% margin percentage)\n$700 3/31/2023 9/30/2025 3.55% (1.3% plus the 2.25% margin percentage)\n$1,400 6/30/2021 3/31/2023 5.25% (3.0% plus the 2.25% margin percentage)\n$900 12/31/2021 6/28/2024 5.35% (3.1% plus the 2.25% margin percentage)\n$400 9/30/2022 6/28/2024 5.25% (3.0% plus the 2.25% margin percentage)\nThe following table summarizes the Companys interest rate cap agreements:\nAggregate Notional Amount (in millions) Start Date End Date Offsets Variable Rate Debt Attributable to\nFluctuations Above:\n$700 3/31/2023 9/30/2025 Three-month LIBOR rate of 1.25%\nCertain derivative asset and liability balances are offset where master netting agreements provide for the legal right of setoff. For classification purposes, we record the net fair value of each type of derivative position that is expected to settle in less than one year with each counterparty as a net current asset or liability and each type of long-term position as a net non-current asset or liability. The amounts shown in the table below represent the gross amounts of recognized assets and liabilities, the amounts offset in the consolidated balance sheets and the net amounts of assets and liabilities presented therein (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nAsset Liability Asset Liability\nInterest rate cap agreements $ 50 $ - $ 8 $ -\nInterest rate swap agreements 145 - - 280\nNet derivatives as classified in the consolidated balance sheet (1)\n$ 195 $ - $ 8 $ 280\n(1)Refer to Note 20, Fair Value Measurements, for the consolidated balance sheets classification of our interest rate swap and cap agreements. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swap and cap agreements is attributable to the upward trend in LIBOR during fiscal 2022.\nBased on the fair value amounts of the interest rate swap and cap agreements determined as of September 30, 2022, the estimated net amount of existing (gains) and losses and caplet amortization expected to be reclassified into interest expense-net within the next 12 months is approximately $(76.3) million.\nForeign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts - The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies, which subjects the Companys cash flows and earnings to exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures arise primarily from purchases or sales of products and services from third parties. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates, and are used to offset changes in the fair value of certain assets or liabilities or forecasted cash flows resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At September 30, 2022, the Company has outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars with notional amounts of $165.6 million. The maximum duration of the Companys foreign currency cash flow hedge contracts at September 30, 2022 is 12 months. These notional values consist of contracts for the Canadian dollar and the euro and are stated in U.S. dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective trade dates. Amounts related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' deficit are reclassified into net sales when the hedged transaction settles.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the losses reclassified on settlements of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges into net sales was approximately $8.1 million. The losses were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' deficit.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company expects to record a net loss of approximately $10.8 million on foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to net sales over the next 12 months.\n22. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe following table presents the total changes by component in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), net of taxes, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nUnrealized gains (losses) on derivatives (1)\nPension and postretirement benefit plans adjustment (2)\nForeign currency translation adjustment\nTotal\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ (302) $ (8) $ (91) $ (401)\nCurrent-period other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification\n68 (10) 90 148\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI 5 - - 5\nNet current-period other comprehensive income 73 (10) 90 153\nBalance at September 30, 2021 (229) (18) (1) (248)\nCurrent-period other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification\n362 2 (379) (15)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI (10) 6 - (4)\nNet current-period other comprehensive income 352 8 (379) (19)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 123 $ (10) $ (380) $ (267)\n(1)Represents unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of tax expense (benefit), of $112 million, $(23) million and $36 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(2)Defined pension plan and postretirement benefit plan activity represents pension liability adjustments, net of tax. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, pension liability adjustments, net of tax of $1 million, represents unrecognized actuarial losses reclassified to other expense (income) upon the settlement of the ERP. Refer to Note 13, Retirement Benefits, for additional information. Pension liability adjustments, net of taxes, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were not material.\nThe following table presents a summary of reclassifications out of AOCI for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Reclassifications out of AOCI for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 were not material (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended September 30,\nDescription of reclassifications out of AOCI 2022 2021\nAmortization from redesignated interest rate swap and cap agreements (1)\n$ 1 $ 2\n(Losses) gains from settlement of foreign currency forward exchange contracts (2)\n(8) 4\nSettlement charges from termination of the ERP (3)\n6 -\nDeferred tax expense on reclassifications out of AOCI (3) (1)\nAmounts reclassified into earnings, net of tax $ (4) $ 5\n(1)This component of AOCI is included in interest expense-net.

Refer to Note 13, Retirement Plans, for additional information.\n23. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nNo divestitures occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. No divestitures occurring in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 met the criteria to qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP as none represented a strategic shift that has or will have a major affect on TransDigm's operations and financial results. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional disclosures on the Company's fiscal 2021 divestitures.\nOn December 20, 2019, TransDigm completed the divestiture of Souriau-Sunbank to Eaton for approximately $920 million.
