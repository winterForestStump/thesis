    "content": "Item 1. Business\nSPDR\u00ae Gold Trust (the Trust) is an investment trust, formed on November 12, 2004 under New York law pursuant to a trust indenture (the Trust Indenture). The Trust holds gold and from time to time issues SPDR\u00ae Gold Shares (the Shares) in Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with redemptions of Baskets. A Basket equals a block of 100,000 Shares. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trusts expenses. World Gold Trust Services, LLC (WGTS) is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor). BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee). State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (SSGA) is the marketing agent of the Trust (the Marketing Agent). HSBC Bank plc (HSBC) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMorgan\") are the Trust's custodians (each a \"Custodian\" and together, the Custodians).\nThe Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.spdrgoldshares.com, through which the registrants annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SECs EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.\nInvestment Objective\nThe Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the gold market through an investment in securities. Historically, the logistics of buying, storing and insuring gold have constituted a barrier to entry for some institutional and retail investors. The ownership of the Shares is intended to overcome these barriers to entry. The logistics of storing and insuring gold are dealt with by the Custodians, and the related expenses are built into the price of the Shares. Therefore, the investor does not have any additional tasks or costs over and above those associated with investing in any other publicly traded security.\nThe Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding allocated gold bullion. The Shares offer an investment that is:\nEasily Accessible. Investors can access the gold market through a traditional brokerage account. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use gold by using the Shares instead of using the traditional means of purchasing, trading and holding gold.\nRelatively Cost Efficient. The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than those associated with the purchase, storage and insurance of allocated gold.\nExchange Traded. The Shares trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. (NYSE Arca) providing investors with an efficient means to buy, sell, or sell short in order to implement a variety of investment strategies. The Shares are eligible for margin accounts. The Shares are also listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), the Singapore Exchange Limited, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nBacked by Gold Held by the Custodians on Behalf of the Trust. The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust and the Trust does not hold or employ any derivative securities. Further, the Trusts holdings and their value based on current market prices are reported on the Trusts website each business day. The Trustees arrangements with the Custodians provide that at the end of each business day only gold bars, and no gold in an unallocated form, is held in the Trust accounts maintained with the Custodians. Accordingly, the Trusts gold holdings are identified on each of the Custodians books as the property of the Trust and held in London, New York or Zurich.\nOverview\nThe Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The gold held by the Trust will only be sold: (1) on an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. The sale of gold by the Trust is a taxable event to shareholders of the Trust (Shareholders). See United States Federal Tax Consequences-Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the CEA) as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC). The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and none of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Marketing Agent is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares.\nThe Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in Baskets. The number of outstanding Shares changes from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption of Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed. The total amount of gold and any cash required for the creation of Baskets is based on the combined net asset value (the NAV) of the number of Baskets being created or redeemed. The number of ounces of gold required to create a Basket or to be delivered upon the redemption of a Basket will continue to gradually decrease over time. This is because the Shares comprising a Basket will represent a decreasing amount of gold due to the sale of the Trusts gold to pay the Trusts expenses.\nBaskets may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. An Authorized Participant is a person who: (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions; (2) is a participant in the Depository Trust Company system (DTC); (3) has entered into an agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the gold and any cash required for such creations and redemptions, or a Participant Agreement; and (4) has established an unallocated gold account meeting the requirements of each of the Custodians. Authorized Participants pay a transaction fee of $2,000 for each order to create or redeem Baskets. Authorized Participants may sell to other investors all or part of the Shares included in the Baskets they purchase from the Trust.\nThe ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the IBA) provides the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall independent administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price. In determining the NAV of the Trust, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process (LBMA Gold Price PM), which is an electronic auction, with the imbalance calculated, and the price adjusted in rounds (30 seconds in duration). The auction runs twice daily at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM London time.\nThe Trustee determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is announced on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. In the event the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that such price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trusts gold, they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the Trustee.\nTo determine the Trusts NAV, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust.\nThe Trusts assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and gold receivable when recorded; representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the Trusts account and, from time to time, cash, which will be used to pay expenses. Cash held by the Trust will not generate any income. The Trust does not hold any derivative instruments. Each Share represents a proportional interest, based on the total number of Shares outstanding, in the gold and any cash held by the Trust, less the Trusts liabilities (which include accrued expenses). While the secondary market trading price of the Shares has fluctuated in response to the price of gold, the Sponsor believes that the trading price of the Shares reflects the estimated accrued expenses of the Trust.\nSales of Gold\nThe Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sells the Trusts gold as necessary to pay the Trusts expenses. As a result, the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trusts expenses and the market price of gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will sell gold to the Custodians at the next LBMA Gold Price PM following the sale order. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. See United States Federal Tax Consequences-Taxation of U.S. Shareholders for information on the tax treatment of gold sales.\nThe Trustee may also sell the Trusts gold if the Sponsor notifies the Trustee that the sale of gold is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of the Trust. The Trustee will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of gold directed by the Sponsor. Any property received by the Trust other than gold, cash or an amount receivable in cash (such as, for example, an insurance claim) will be promptly sold or otherwise disposed of by the Trustee.\nGold Price Information\nInvestors may obtain on a 24-hour basis gold pricing information based on the spot price for an ounce of gold from various financial information service providers. Current spot prices are also generally available with bid/ask spreads from gold bullion dealers. In addition, the Trusts website provides ongoing pricing information for gold spot prices and the Shares. Market prices for the Shares are available from a variety of sources including brokerage firms, information websites and other information service providers. The NAV of the Trust is published by the Sponsor on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and is posted on the Trusts website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.\nThe Gold Industry\nGold Supply and Demand\nGold is a physical asset that is accumulated rather than consumed. As a result, virtually all the gold that has ever been mined still exists today in one form or another. The following table is a summary of the world gold supply and demand for the past 5 years. It is based on information reported in the Gold Focus 20231.\nWorld Gold Supply and Demand (2018-2022)\nTonnes\nSUPPLY\nMine Production\n3,656\n3,596\n3,482\n3,581\n3,628\nRecycling\n1,132\n1,276\n1,293\n1,136\n1,141\nNet Hedging Supply\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal Supply\n4,788\n4,878\n4,775\n4,717\n4,768\nDEMAND\nJewelry Fabrication\n2,290\n2,152\n1,324\n2,230\n2,192\nIndustrial Demand\nNet Physical Investment\n1,068\n1,183\n1,216\nNet Hedging Demand\n-\nNet Official Sector Buying\n1,083\nTotal Demand\n4,360\n3,932\n2,820\n4,200\n4,810\nMarket Balance\n1,955\n(42 )\nNet Investment in ETPs\n(189 )\n(110 )\nMarket Balance less ETPs\n1,062\nGold Price (US$/oz, London)\n1,268\n1,393\n1,770\n1,799\n1,800\nSource: Gold Focus 2023\nSources of Gold Supply\nBased on data from Gold Focus 2023, gold supply averaged 4,785 tonnes per year between 2018 and 2022. Sources of gold supply include both mine production and recycled above-ground stocks and, to a lesser extent, producer net hedging. The largest portion of gold supplied to the market is from mine production, which averaged approximately 3,589 tonnes per year from 2018 through 2022. The second largest source of annual gold supply is recycling gold, which is gold that has been recovered from jewelry and other fabricated products and converted back into marketable gold. Recycled gold averaged approximately 1,196 tonnes annually between 2018 through 2022.\nGold Focus 2023 is published by Metals Focus, Ltd. which is a precious metals research consultancy based in London. Metals Focus Data Ltd., an affiliate of the Sponsor, provides the supply and demand data to Metals Focus, Ltd. When used in this prospectus tonne refers to one metric tonne, which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or 32,151 troy ounces.\nSources of Gold Demand\nBased on data from Gold Focus 2023, gold demand averaged 4,024 tonnes per year between 2018 and 2022. Gold demand generally comes from four sources: jewelry, industry (including medical applications), investment and the official sector (including central banks and supranational organizations). The largest source of demand comes from jewelry fabrication, which accounted for approximately 51% of the identifiable demand from 2018 through 2022 followed by net physical investment, which represents identifiable investment demand, which accounted for approximately 26%.\nGold demand is widely dispersed throughout the world with significant contributions from India and China. In many countries there are seasonal fluctuations in the levels of demand for gold-especially jewelry. However, as a result of variations in the timing of seasons throughout the world, seasonal fluctuations in demand do not appear to have a significant impact on the global gold price.\nBetween 2018 and 2022, according to Gold Focus 2023, central bank purchases averaged 610 tonnes. The prominence given by market commentators to this activity coupled with the total amount of gold held by the official sector has resulted in this area being one of the more visible shifts in the gold market.\nOperation of the Gold Bullion Market\nThe global trade in gold consists of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.\nGlobal Over-the-Counter Market\nThe OTC market trades on a continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading. Market makers and participants in the OTC market trade with each other and their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. The three products relevant to LBMA market making are Spot (S), Forwards (F) and Options (O). There are eleven LBMA Market Makers who provide the service in one, two or all three products2.\nMember\nMembership Type\nSpot (S)\nForwards (F)\nOptions (O)\nCitibank N A\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nGoldman Sachs International\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nHSBC\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nJP Morgan Chase Bank\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nMorgan Stanley & Co International Ltd\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nUBS AG\nFull Market Makers\nx\nx\nx\nBNP Paribas SA\nMarket Makers\nx\nICBC Standard Bank Plc\nMarket Makers\nx\nMerrill Lynch International\nMarket Makers\nx\nx\nStandard Chartered Bank\nMarket Makers\nx\nx\nToronto-Dominion Bank\nMarket Makers\nx\nThe OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in term of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet their clients requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place.\nThe main centers of the OTC market are London, New York and Zurich. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business. Bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the worlds major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA.\nIn the OTC market, the standard size of gold trades ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer spreads are typically $0.50 per ounce. Transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely, with some dealers willing to offer clients competitive prices for larger volumes, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers.\nwww.lbma.org.uk/aboutmembership\nLiquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads-the difference between a dealers buy and sell prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange Inc. (the COMEX).\nThe London Bullion Market\nAlthough the market for physical gold is global, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the London Good Delivery Lists, which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.\nThe term loco London refers to gold bars physically held in London that meet the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of an LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in The Good Delivery Rules published by the LBMA. Gold bars meeting these requirements are known as London Good Delivery Bars. The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams = 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. Typically referred to as 400- ounce bars, a London Good Delivery Bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%), be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of 0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar.\nLBMA Gold Price\nThe LBMA Gold Price is determined twice daily during London trading hours through an auction which provides reference gold prices for that days trading. The LBMA Gold Price was initiated on March 20, 2015 and replaced the London PM Gold Fix. The auction that determines the LBMA Gold Price is a physically settled, electronic and tradeable auction, with the ability to settle trades in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds. The IBA provides the auction platform and methodology as well as the overall administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price. Many long-term contracts are expected to be priced on the basis of either the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) LBMA Gold Price, and many market participants are expected to refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA) in the U.K. regulates the LBMA Gold Price.\nFutures Exchanges\nThe most significant gold futures exchange is the COMEX, part of the CME Group. It began to offer trading in gold futures contracts in 1974, and for most of the period since that date, it has been the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options. The Tokyo Commodity Exchange (the TOCOM) is another significant futures exchange and has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. Both the COMEX and the TOCOM operate through a central clearance system, and in each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. Other commodity exchanges include, the Multi Commodity Exchange of India, the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Shanghai Gold Exchange, ICE Futures US (the ICE), and the Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange. The ICE and CME Group are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group.\nMarket Regulation\nThe global gold markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants.\nMovements in the Price of Gold\nThe following chart provides historical background on the price of gold. The chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from the day the Shares began trading on the NYSE on November 18, 2004 to September 30, 2023, and is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM when available from March 20, 2015 and previously the London PM Fix.\nDaily Gold Price - November 18, 2004 - September 30, 2023\nLBMA Gold Price PM USD\nResponsibly Sourced Gold\nThe LBMAs Responsible Sourcing Programme (the Programme) is mandatory for all Good Delivery refiners trading with the London bullion market. The LBMA established the Programme to consolidate, strengthen and formalize the existing standards of the LBMA Good Delivery refiners due diligence practices with the intent to protect the integrity of the global supply chain for the wholesale precious metals markets. The Programme includes measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and human rights abuses globally.\nThe Responsible Gold Guidance (the Guidance) is the specific document that underpins the Programme. All LBMA Good Delivery refiners are required to implement the LBMAs Responsible Sourcing Guidance, which comprises the Guidance, and obtain annual independent assurance on their publicly available compliance reporting. Failure to appropriately adhere to the Guidance may result in a refiner being removed from the Good Delivery List, following the LBMAs incident review process.\nCreation and Redemption of Shares\nThe Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. Creations of Baskets may only be settled after the requisite gold is deposited in the allocated account of the Trust.\nAuthorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor without the consent of any Shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares.\nSome of the activities of Authorized Participants will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). As of the date of this annual report, the Authorized Participants are Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co. LLC, Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC. An updated list of Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Trustee or the Sponsor.\nPrior to initiating any creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have established an unallocated account with (i) HSBC if HSBC is the Custodian or (ii) any gold clearing bank of the London Precious Metals Clearing Limited (\"LPMCL\") if JPMorgan is the Custodian. An unallocated account is an account with a bullion dealer, which may also be a bank, to which a fine weight amount of gold is credited. Transfers to or from an unallocated account are made by crediting or debiting the number of ounces of gold being deposited or withdrawn. The account holder is entitled to direct the bullion dealer to deliver an amount of physical gold equal to the amount of gold standing to the credit of the account holder. Gold held in an unallocated account is not segregated from the Custodians assets. The account holder therefore has no ownership interest in any specific bars of gold that the bullion dealer holds or owns. The account holder is an unsecured creditor of the bullion dealer, and credits to an unallocated account are at risk of the bullion dealers insolvency, in which event it may not be possible for a liquidator to identify any gold held in an unallocated account as belonging to the account holder rather than to the bullion dealer.\nCertain Authorized Participants are able to participate directly in the gold bullion market and the gold futures market. In some cases, an Authorized Participant may from time to time acquire gold from or sell gold to its affiliated gold trading desk, which may profit in these instances. The Sponsor believes that the size and operation of the gold bullion market make it unlikely that an Authorized Participants direct activities in the gold or securities markets will impact the price of gold or the price of the Shares. Authorized Participants must be: (1) a DTC Participant; (2) registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act, and regulated by FINRA, or some other self-regulatory organization or will be exempt from being or otherwise not be required to be so regulated or registered; and (3) qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Each Authorized Participant will have its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime.\nAuthorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Baskets. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Persons interested in purchasing Baskets should contact the Sponsor or the Trustee to obtain the contact information for the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants will only be able to redeem their Shares through an Authorized Participant.\nAll gold bullion must be delivered to the Trust and distributed by the Trust in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized Participants' unallocated accounts and the Trust's unallocated accounts.\nAll gold bullion must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%) and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, including the specifications for a London Good Delivery Bar.\nUnder the Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Authorized Participants, solely from and to the extent of the Trusts assets, for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the Sponsor to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts when due.\nThe following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets is only a summary and investors should review the description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets set forth in the Trust Indenture and the form of Participant Agreement, each of which has been filed as an exhibit to this report.\nCreation Procedures\nOn any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to create one or more Baskets. Purchase orders must be placed by 4:00 PM or the close of regular trading on NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Trustee receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date.\nBy placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit gold with the Trust, or a combination of gold and cash, as described below. Prior to the delivery of Baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order.\nDetermination of Required Deposits\nThe total deposit required to create each Basket is an amount of gold and cash, if any, that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the Trust (net of estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to purchase is properly received as the number of Shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of Shares outstanding on the date the order is received.\nDelivery of Required Deposits\nAn Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its unallocated account with the required gold deposit amount by the end of the second business day in London following the purchase order date. From time to time, the Sponsor will identify to the Authorized Participants which Custodians may be used for the deposit of the required gold deposit amount. If the Authorized Participants unallocated account is with the selected Custodian, the selected Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee, will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the gold deposit amount by debiting such amount from the Authorized Participants unallocated account and crediting such amount to the Trusts unallocated account. If the Authorized Participants unallocated account is with another LPMCL gold clearing bank, the selected Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee, will receive on the second business day following the purchase order date the gold deposit amount from the Authorized Participant's unallocated account and credit such amount to the Trust's unallocated account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping of gold until such gold has been received by the Trust will be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. If gold is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to establish such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts as the Sponsor determines to be desirable.\nActing on instructions given by the Trustee, the selected Custodian will transfer the gold deposit amount from the Trust's unallocated account to the Trust's allocated account on the second business day following the purchase order date by allocating to the Trust's allocated account specific bars of gold from unallocated bars which the Custodian holds or instructing a subcustodian to allocate specific bars of gold from unallocated bars held by or for the subcustodian. The gold bars in an allocated gold account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows, for each gold bar, the refiner, assay or fineness, serial number and gross and fine weight. Gold held in the Trusts allocated account is the property of the Trust and is not traded, leased or loaned under any circumstances.\nThe selected Custodian will, or will endeavor to, transfer the gold deposit amount from the Trusts unallocated Account to the Trusts allocated account by 2:00 PM (London time). By 2:00 PM (London time), the selected Custodian will advise the Trustee as to the status of the allocation process. Upon Trustees receipt of confirmation from the Custodian that the gold deposit amount has been transferred from the Trust's unallocated account to the Trust's allocated account, the Trustee will direct DTC to credit the number of Baskets ordered by the Authorized Participant to the Authorized Participants DTC account. During the period of the transfer, all Shareholders will be exposed to the risks of unallocated gold to the extent of that gold deposit amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process.\nRedemption Procedures\nThe procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 4:00 PM or the close of regular trading on NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee.\nDetermination of Redemption Distribution\nThe redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participants unallocated account representing the amount of the gold held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed plus, or minus, the cash redemption amount. The cash redemption amount is equal to the value of all assets of the Trust other than gold less all estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities, divided by the number of Baskets outstanding and multiplied by the number of Baskets included in the Authorized Participants redemption order. The Sponsor anticipates that in the ordinary course of the Trusts operations there will be no cash distributions made to Authorized Participants upon redemptions. Fractions of a fine ounce of gold included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption distributions are subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due.\nDelivery of Redemption Distribution\nThe redemption distribution due from the Trust is delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following the redemption order date if, by 9:00 AM New York time on such second business day, the Trustees DTC account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. If the Trustees DTC account has not been credited with all of the Baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole Baskets received if the Trustee receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Trustee may, from time to time, determine and the remaining Baskets to be redeemed are credited to the Trustees DTC account by 9:00 AM New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order may be cancelled. The Trustee is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Trustees DTC account by 9:00 AM New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTCs book entry system on such terms as the Sponsor and the Trustee may from time to time agree upon.\nThe selected Custodian transfers the redemption gold amount from the Trust's allocated account to the Trust's unallocated account and, thereafter, to the redeeming Authorized Participants unallocated account. The Authorized Participant and the Trust are each at risk in respect of gold credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodians insolvency. See Risk Factors-Gold held in the Trusts unallocated gold accounts with the Custodians and any Authorized Participants unallocated gold account with a Custodian or another LPMCL gold clearing bank will not be segregated from the assets of the relevant Custodian or LPMCL gold clearing bank.\nSuspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders\nThe Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date for: (1) any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted; (2) any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold is not reasonably practicable; or (3) such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of the Shareholders.\nThe Trustee will reject a redemption order if: (1) the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement; (2) the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful; (3) the order would have adverse tax consequences to the Trust or its Shareholders; or (4) circumstances outside the control of the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Custodians make the redemption, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process.\nNone of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Custodians will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension, postponement or rejection.\nCreation and Redemption Transaction Fee\nAn Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of $2,000 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets. The transaction fee may be changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. The Trustee shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice. A transaction fee may not exceed 0.10% of the value of a Basket at the time the creation and redemption order is accepted.\nTax Responsibility\nAuthorized Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of Baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Trust if they are required by law to pay any such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax or interest thereon.\nTrust Expenses\nThe Trustee sells gold as needed to pay the expenses of the Trust. As a result, the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trusts expenses and the market price of gold. Cash held by the Trustee does not bear any interest. The Trusts estimated ordinary operating expenses are accrued daily and reflected in the NAV of the Trust.\nThe Trusts only recurring fixed expense is the Sponsors fee which accrues daily at an annual rate equal to 0.40% of the daily NAV. In exchange for the Sponsors fee, the Sponsor agrees to pay all ordinary fees and expenses of the Trust which include fees and expenses of the Trustee, fees and expenses of the Custodians for the custody of the Trusts gold bars, fees and expenses of the Sponsor, certain taxes, fees of the Marketing Agent, printing and mailing costs, legal and audit fees, registration fees, NYSE Arca listing fees and other marketing costs and expenses. Additionally, under a separate agreement with JPMorgan, the Sponsor has agreed to pay or reimburse JPMorgan for any value added, sales or similar tax chargeable on the services provided by JPMorgan as a Custodian, including any such taxes otherwise payable by the Trust. The Sponsors fees were $221,609,174 for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nIn addition, the following expenses may be accrued and paid by the Trust:\nExpenses and other charges of the Custodians payable by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust under the Custody Agreements (as defined under \"Description of the Custody Agreements\") (including (1) any relevant taxes, duties and governmental charges; and (2) the obligation to indemnify the Custodians) and, subject to the prior written approval of the Sponsor, (A) other expenses and charges for the custody, deposit or delivery of gold and services related to the custody and safekeeping of gold; and (B) expenses and charges charged by other custodians pursuant to a custody agreement;\nExpenses of the Trustee for uncustomary and extraordinary out-of-pocket expenses and fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services performed under the Trust Indenture;\nCertain taxes and various other governmental charges;\nVarious taxes and governmental charges and any taxes, fees and charges payable by the Trustee with respect to the creation or redemption of Baskets;\nAny taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Sponsor in respect of the Trust, its assets, including gold, or the Shares;\nExpenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of Shareholders;\nAmounts for indemnification of the Trustee or the Sponsor as permitted under the Trust Indenture;\nExpenses incurred in contacting Shareholders exceeding an aggregate amount for any fiscal year of $500,000;\nAmounts for reimbursement in respect of certain claims described under Risk Factors-The Trusts obligation to reimburse the Marketing Agent and the Authorized Participants for certain liabilities;\nThe amount of any legal fees and expenses (including the costs of any litigation) of (i) the Sponsor and the Trust, (ii) the Custodians and (iii) the Trustee in excess of an aggregate amount for any fiscal year of $500,000; and\nAll other expenses of the Trust not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor under the Trust Indenture.\nThe Sponsor\nThe Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company formed on July 17, 2002. The Sponsor was responsible for establishing the Trust and for the registration of the Shares. The Sponsor generally oversees the performance of the Trustee and the Trusts principal service providers, but does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or such service providers. The Sponsor regularly communicates with the Trustee to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Sponsor may direct the Trustee, but only as provided in the Trust Indenture. The Sponsor, with assistance and support from the Trustee, is responsible for preparing and filing periodic reports on behalf of the Trust with the SEC and will provide any required certification for such reports. The Sponsor will designate the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust and may from time to time employ legal counsel for the Trust. To assist the Sponsor in marketing the Shares, the Sponsor has entered into the Marketing Agent Agreement with the Marketing Agent and the Trust. See The Marketing Agent for more information about the Marketing Agent. The Sponsor maintains a public website on behalf of the Trust (www.spdrgoldshares.com), which contains information about the Trust and the Shares.\nThe Sponsor will not be liable to the Trustee or any Shareholder for any action taken or for refraining from taking any action in good faith, or for errors in judgment or for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale of any gold or other assets of the Trust. However, the preceding liability exclusion will not protect the Sponsor against any liability resulting from its own gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or willful malfeasance in the performance of its duties or the reckless disregard of its obligations and duties to the Trust.\nThe Sponsor and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, affiliates and subsidiaries are indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against certain losses, liabilities or expenses incurred in the performance of its duties under the Trust Indenture without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance or reckless disregard of the indemnified partys obligations and duties under the Trust Indenture. Such indemnity includes payment from the Trust of the costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim or liability under the Trust Indenture. Under the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor may be able to seek indemnification from the Trust for payments it makes in connection with the Sponsors activities under the Trust Indenture to the extent its conduct does not disqualify it from receiving such indemnification under the terms of the Trust Indenture. The Sponsor will also be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense arising under the Marketing Agent Agreement or any Participant Agreement insofar as such loss, liability or expense arises from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any written statement provided to the Sponsor by the Trustee. Any amounts payable to the Sponsor are secured by a lien on the Trust.\nThe Trustee\nBNYM, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers, serves as the Trustee. BNYM has a trust office at 2 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, New York 11217. BNYM is subject to supervision by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Under the Trust Indenture, the Trustee is required to maintain an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $500 million.\nThe Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trusts operational records. The Trustees principal responsibilities include: (1) selling the Trusts gold as needed to pay the Trusts expenses (gold sales occur monthly in the ordinary course); (2) calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share; (3) receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodians and DTC; and (4) monitoring the Custodians. If the Trustee determines that maintaining gold with one of the Custodians is not in the best interest of the Trust, the Trustee must so advise the Sponsor, who may direct the Trustee to take certain actions in respect of such Custodian. In the absence of such instructions, the Trustee may initiate action to remove the gold from such Custodian. The ability of the Trustee to monitor the performance of the Custodians may be limited because under the Custody Agreements the Trustee only has the right, up to twice a year, visit the premises of the Custodians for the purpose of examining the Trusts gold and certain related records maintained by the Custodians. Inspectorate International Limited (Inspectorate) conducts two counts each year of the gold bullion stock held on behalf of the Trust at the vaults of the Custodians. A complete bar count is conducted once per year and coincides with the Trusts financial year end at September 30th. Inspectorate concluded the annual full count of the Trusts gold bullion held by (i) HSBC at its London vault on October 2, 2023, (ii) JPMorgan at its London vault on October 2, 2023 and (iii) JPMorgan at its New York vault on October 2, 2023. The second count is a random sample count and is conducted at a date which falls within the same financial year and was conducted most recently at JPMorgan's London vault on March 24, 2023 and at HSBC's vault on April 5, 2023. The Trustee has no right to visit the premises of any subcustodian for the purposes of examining the Trusts gold or any records maintained by the subcustodian, and no subcustodian is obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such subcustodian. The Trustee regularly communicates with the Sponsor to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Trustee, along with the Sponsor, liaises with the Trusts legal, accounting and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee assists and supports the Sponsor with the preparation of all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust.\nAffiliates of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.\nThe Marketing Agent\nSSGA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Corporation, acts as the Marketing Agent. The Marketing Agent is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA. The Marketing Agents principal place of business is located at One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210.\nThe Marketing Agents Role and the Marketing Agent Agreement\nThe Marketing Agent assists the Sponsor in: (1) developing a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis; (2) preparing marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trusts website; (3) executing the marketing plan for the Trust; (4) incorporating gold into its strategic and tactical exchange-traded fund research; (5) sublicensing the SPDR\u00ae trademark; and (6) assisting with certain shareholder services, such as a call center and prospectus fulfillment.\nThe Marketing Agent and its affiliates may from time to time become Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.\nThe Sponsor and the Marketing Agent entered into an Amended and Restated Marketing Agent Agreement effective July 17, 2015 (as further amended from time to time, the Marketing Agent Agreement) which contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Marketing Agent from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and to contribute to payments that the Marketing Agent may be required to make in respect thereof. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Marketing Agent, solely from and to the extent of the Trusts assets, for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the Sponsor in respect of such liabilities to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts when due.\nThe Marketing Agent Agreement expires on July 17, 2024 and thereafter automatically renews for successive two-year periods unless terminated in accordance with the agreement by either party twelve months prior to the end of the then-current term. If the Sponsor or Marketing Agent terminates the agreement for certain reasons specified in it, the Sponsor is required to pay the Marketing Agent the present market value of the future payments the Marketing Agent would otherwise receive under that agreement over the subsequent five-year period.\nLicense Agreement with the Marketing Agent\nThe Sponsor and the World Gold Council (the WGC) entered into a license agreement, dated as of November 16, 2004, with the Marketing Agent. Under the license agreement, the Sponsor and the WGC granted the Marketing Agent a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable: (1) sublicense under the license agreement among the Sponsor, the WGC and BNYM, to BNYMs patents and patent applications that cover securitized gold products in connection with the Marketing Agents performance of its services under the Marketing Agent Agreement; and (2) a license to the Sponsors and the WGCs patents, patent applications and intellectual property and trade name and trademark rights in connection with the Marketing Agents performance of its services under the Marketing Agent Agreement and for the purpose of establishing, operating and marketing financial products involving the securitization of gold.\nThe license agreement will expire upon the expiration or termination of the Marketing Agent Agreement. Either party may terminate the license agreement prior to such term if the other party materially breaches the license agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days following written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party. The license agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, the Sponsor, the WGC and the Marketing Agent have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of their respective representations and warranties and the Sponsor and the WGC have agreed to indemnify the Marketing Agent for violations of the intellectual property rights of others as a result of the Marketing Agents use of the licensed intellectual property.\nSPDR Sublicense Agreement\nSPDR is a trademark of SPDJI and has been licensed for use by the SPDR\u00ae Gold Trust pursuant to a SPDR Sublicense Agreement, dated May 20, 2008, between the Sponsor, the WGC, the Marketing Agent and State Street Corporation, pursuant to which the Marketing Agent and State Street Corporation granted the Sponsor and the WGC a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable sublicense to use the SPDR\u00ae trademark (in accordance with the SPDR Trademark License Agreement dated as of November 29, 2006, as amended, between State Street Global Advisors, a division of State Street Bank and Trust Company, and S&P), for the purpose of establishing and operating the Trust, issuing and distributing the Shares, using SPDR as part of the name of the Shares and listing the Shares on exchanges.\nThe sublicense agreement will expire upon the expiration or termination of the earlier of (i) the Marketing Agent Agreement or (ii) the SPDR\u00ae Trademark License Agreement. Either party may terminate the sublicense agreement prior to such term if the other party materially breaches the license agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days following written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party. The sublicense agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, the Sponsor, the WGC, the Marketing Agent and State Street Corporation have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of their respective representations, warranties and covenants.\nThe Custodians\nHSBC and JPMorgan, as Custodians, are responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust's gold deposited with each of them by Authorized Participants in connection with the creation of Baskets. The Custodians facilitate the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through the unallocated gold accounts of the Authorized Participants and the unallocated and allocated gold accounts each Custodian maintains for the Trust. Each Custodian is responsible for allocating specific bars of gold bullion to the Trust's allocated accounts maintained by such Custodian. Each Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the transfers of gold in and out of the Trust's allocated account at such Custodian and identifying the gold bars held in the Trust's allocated account at such Custodian.\nHSBC operates its custody business out of its London office located at 8 Canada Square, London, E14 5HQ, United Kingdom. HSBC was incorporated with limited liability in England and is a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc, or HSBC Group, a public limited company incorporated in England. HSBC Group had $166 billion in regulatory capital resources according to HSBC Holdings plcs Interim Report as of September 30, 2023. HSBC is authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (the \"PRA\") and regulated by the PRA and the FCA in the United Kingdom.\nJPMorgan operates its custody business out of its London office located at 25 Bank Street, Canary Warf, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan was incorporated in the U.S. with limited liability as a National Banking Association and is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase & Co. had $3.9 trillion in assets and $317 billion in stockholders' equity according to its third-quarter 2023 financial results. JPMorgan is supervised and regulated in the U.S. by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, with respect to certain matters, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the United Kingdom, JPMorgan is authorized by the PRA and subject to regulation by the FCA and the PRA. JPMorgan also maintains vaults in New York and Zurich.\nThe Custodians are both market makers, clearers and approved weighers under the rules of the LBMA.\nThe Custodians and their affiliates may from time-to-time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.\nCustody of the Trusts Gold\nCustody of the gold bullion deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by HSBC at its London vault and by JPMorgan at its London, New York and Zurich vaults. Each Custodian holds all of the Trusts gold in its respective vault premises except when the gold has been allocated in the vault of a subcustodian, and in such cases each Custodian has agreed that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly transport or transfer the gold from the subcustodians vault to the Custodians London vault, at the Custodians cost and risk.\nEach Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of gold in unallocated form. Acting on instructions given by the Trustee, each Custodian allocates gold deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting bars of gold bullion for deposit to the Trust's allocated account with that Custodian from unallocated bars which the Custodian holds or by instructing a subcustodian to allocate bars from unallocated bars held by the subcustodian. All gold bullion allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, and the Custodians must replace any non-conforming gold bullion with conforming bullion as soon as practical.\nThe Trustee has entered into Custody Agreements with each Custodian which establish the Trust's unallocated and allocated accounts with that Custodian. The Trust's unallocated accounts are used to facilitate the transfer of gold deposits and gold redemption distributions between Authorized Participants and the Trust in connection with the creation and redemption of Baskets and the sales of gold made by the Trustee for the Trust. Except when gold is transferred in and out of the Trust, all gold deposited with the Trust is held in the Trust's allocated accounts with the Custodians.\nEach Custodian is authorized to appoint a subcustodian from time to time to hold the Trusts gold until it can be transported or transferred to that Custodians London vault. A subcustodian appointed by a Custodian must be approved by the Trustee and the Sponsor and must be a LBMA member or the Bank of England. Current lists of all gold held by the Custodians, including any held with a subcustodian, is available on the Sponsors website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.\nIn accordance with LBMA practices and customs, the Custodians do not have written custody agreements with the subcustodians they select. The lack of such written contracts could affect the recourse of the Trust and the Custodians against any subcustodian in the event a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of the Trusts gold. See Risk Factors-The ability of the Trustee and the Custodians to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited.\nThe Custodians are required to use reasonable care in selecting subcustodians, but otherwise have limited responsibility in relation to the subcustodians appointed by them. The Custodians are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of gold from those subcustodians appointed by them. Otherwise, the Custodians do not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their custody functions. Since August 13, 2020, the Custodians have not utilized any subcustodians on behalf of the Trust.\nSelected subcustodians appointed by HSBC, as Custodian, have the ability to appoint further subcustodians who are not expected to have written custody agreements with HSBC's subcustodians that selected them. HSBC may not have the right to, and does not have the obligation to, seek recovery of the gold from any subcustodian appointed by a subcustodian. HSBC does not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their selection of further subcustodians.\nUnder the customs and practices of the London bullion market, allocated gold is held by custodians and, on their behalf, by subcustodians under arrangements that permit each entity for which gold is being held: (1) to request from the entitys custodian (and a custodian or subcustodian to request from its subcustodian) a list identifying each gold bar being held and the identity of the particular custodian or subcustodian holding the gold bar and (2) to request the entitys custodian to release the entitys gold within two business days following demand for release. Each custodian or subcustodian is obligated under the customs and practices of the London bullion market to provide the bar list and the identification of custodians and subcustodians referred to in (1) above, and each custodian is obligated to release gold as requested. Under English law, unless otherwise provided in any applicable custody agreement, a custodian generally is liable to its customer for failing to take reasonable care of the customers gold and for failing to release the customers gold upon demand. While HSBC will not be liable for the acts or omissions, or for the solvency, of any subcustodian that it selects unless the selection of that subcustodian was made negligently or in bad faith, JPMorgan is liable for the acts or omissions, or for the insolvency, of any subcustodian that it selects .\nThe Custodians and the Trustee do not require any direct or indirect subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities. Each Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate. Subject to confidentiality restrictions and in connection with the registration of the Shares, HSBC will allow the Trustee and the Sponsor (so long as the Sponsor is WGTS) to review its insurance coverage. Subject to confidentiality restrictions, JPMorgan will allow the Trustee to review its insurance coverage and will provide the Sponsor with information about its insurance coverage required by the Sponsor in connection with the registration of the Shares. The Trust will not be a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence, nature or amount of the coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that a Custodian maintains adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.\nDescription of the Custody Agreements\nHSBC entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Allocated Bullion Account Agreement (the \"HSBC Allocated Account Agreement\") and the Second Amended and Restated Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement (the \"HSBC Unallocated Account Agreement\" and together with the HSBC Allocated Account Agreement, as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the \"HSBC Custody Agreements\") with the Trustee, and JPMorgan entered into the Allocated Precious Metal Account Agreement (the \"JPMorgan Allocated Account Agreement\") and the Unallocated Precious Metal Account Agreement (the \"JPMorgan Unallocated Account Agreement\" and together with the JPMorgan Allocated Account Agreement, as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the \"JPMorgan Custody Agreements\" and together with the HSBC Custody Agreements, the \"Custody Agreements\") with the Trustee. The Custody Agreements establish the Trust's unallocated and allocated accounts with the Custodians. The following is a description of the material terms of the Custody Agreements. As the Custody Agreements are similar in form, they are discussed together, with material distinctions between the agreements noted.\nReports\nEach Custodian provides the Trustee with reports for each business day, identifying the movements of gold in and out of the Trust's allocated accounts it maintains and the credits and debits of gold to the Trust's unallocated account it maintains. The reports contain sufficient information to identify each bar of gold held in the Trust's allocated accounts and, if the bar is being held temporarily by a subcustodian, the identity of the subcustodian.\nTransfers into and from the Trust's Unallocated Accounts\nAll transfers into and out of the Trust's unallocated accounts are made only upon receipt of and in accordance with instructions from the Trustee. Each Custodian accepts deposits into the Trust's unallocated account of gold the Custodian receives from (1) the Trust's allocated account in connection with a redemption of Shares, (2) an Authorized Participant's unallocated account in connection with the creation of Shares, (3) the other Custodian's unallocated account in connection with a book entry or other transfer between the Custodians or (4) an unallocated account with a third-party permitted under the Custody Agreements.\nA withdrawal from the Trust's unallocated account with a Custodian may be made by (1) transferring gold to an Authorized Participant's unallocated account in connection with a redemption of Shares, (2) allocating gold to the Trust's allocated accounts in connection with a creation of Shares, (3) transferring gold, including by book entry transfers, to the other Custodian's Trust unallocated account or (4) transferring gold to an unallocated account with a third-party as permitted under the Custody Agreements.\nThe Custody Agreements also allow for the withdrawal of physical gold from the Trust's unallocated account upon the Trustee's instruction. Any gold made available in a physical form must comply with the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA, LPMCL, the FCA, the PRA, the Bank of England or any applicable regulatory body (collectively, the \"Custody Rules\").\nThe Custody Agreements provide for the full allocation of all gold credited to the Trust's unallocated account at the end of each business day. The Custody Agreements include an overdraft facility with each Custodian under which each Custodian will make available to the Trust's unallocated account with that Custodian up to 430 fine ounces of gold in order to allow the Custodian to fully allocate all gold credited to the Trust's unallocated account with that Custodian to the Trust's allocated account with that Custodian at the end of each business day.\nTransfers into and from the Trust's Allocated Accounts\nAll transfers into and out of the Trust's allocated accounts are made only upon receipt of and in accordance with instructions from the Trustee. The Custodians receive transfers of gold into the Trust's allocated accounts by debiting gold from the Trust's unallocated account and crediting such gold to the Trust's allocated account. Conversely, the Custodians transfer gold from the Trust's allocated accounts by debiting gold from the Trust's allocated account and crediting the gold to the Trust's unallocated account.\nFrom time to time, the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to instruct JPMorgan to transfer gold between the Trust's three allocated accounts maintained by JPMorgan in London, New York and Zurich.\nWithdrawals of Gold Directly from the Trust's Allocated Accounts\nUpon the Trustees instruction, the Custodians will make physical gold held in the Trust's allocated account available for withdrawal by debiting the gold from the Trust's allocated account and making the gold available for collection by the Trustee's designated carrier at the Trust's expense and risk. Unless the Trustee specifies the bars of gold to be debited from the Trust's allocated account, the Custodians are entitled to select the gold bars.\nExclusion of Liability\nHSBC will use reasonable care in the performance of its duties under the HSBC Custody Agreements and is only responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Trust as a direct result of any negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. HSBCs liability under the HSBC Allocated Account Agreement is limited to the market value of the gold held in the Trust's allocated account at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by HSBC, provided that HSBC promptly notifies the Trustee of its discovery. HSBCs liability under the HSBC Unallocated Account Agreement is limited to the amount of the gold credited to the Trust's unallocated account at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by HSBC, provided that HSBC promptly notifies the Trustee of its discovery. HSBC will not be liable for any loss suffered as a result of any act or omission or insolvency of any subcustodian, except to the extent directly resulting from HSBC's fraud, negligence or bad faith in the appointment of that subcustodian. HSBC will not be liable for any consequential loss, or loss of profit or goodwill.\nJPMorgan will use reasonable care in the performance of its duties under the JPMorgan Unallocated Account Agreement and will act as a reasonable and prudent custodian in the performance of its duties under the JPMorgan Allocated Agreement. JPMorgan will be responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Trust as a direct result of any negligence, fraud or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. JPMorgan will also be liable for any loss suffered by the Trust as a result of any act or omission or insolvency of any subcustodian, including to the extent directly resulting from JPMorgan's fraud or negligence in the appointment of that subcustodian. Under the JPMorgan Custody Agreements, JPMorgan's liability is limited to the aggregate market value of the Trust's allocated account balances and the Trust's unallocated account balance at the time of such negligence, fraud or willful misconduct or act, omission or insolvency of any subcustodian. JPMorgan will not be liable for any consequential loss, or loss of profit or goodwill, whether or not resulting from any negligence, fraud or willful misconduct on behalf of JPMorgan.\nNeither Custodian has a duty to make or take or to require any subcustodian selected by it to make or take any special arrangements or precautions beyond those required by the Custody Rules or as specifically set forth in the Custody Agreements. Neither Custodian will be liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance of any of its obligations under the Custody Agreements by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control.\nIndemnity\nSolely out of the Trusts assets, the Trust will indemnify each Custodian on demand against all costs and expenses, damages, liabilities and losses which such Custodian may suffer or incur in connection with the Custody Agreements, except to the extent that such sums are due directly to such Custodians negligence, willful default (or willful misconduct in the case of JPMorgan) or fraud. Under the HSBC Custody Agreements, this indemnity expressly extends to HSBCs directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates and subsidiaries.\nTermination\nEach Custody Agreement may be terminated by the Trustee or the relevant Custodian (1) upon 90 business days prior notice or (2) immediately upon certain events of insolvency of the other party. HSBC may also terminate the HSBC Unallocated Account Agreement if the Trust does not transfer to or repay HSBC the amount of any gold borrowed under the overdraft facility with HSBC within 30 business days of a request by HSBC to do so. JPMorgan may also immediately terminate the JPMorgan Custody Agreements if certain sanction related representations and agreements concerning the Trust or the Trustee are breached.\nGoverning Law\nThe Custody Agreements are governed by English law. The Trustee and each Custodian consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.\nDescription of the Shares\nGeneral\nThe Trustee is authorized under the Trust Indenture to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the registration statement of which this report is a part will require the registration of such additional Shares.\nDescription of Limited Rights\nThe Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to shares of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. As a Shareholder, you do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Indenture. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions.\nDistributions\nThe Trust Indenture provides for distributions to Shareholders in only two circumstances. First, if the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that the Trusts cash account balance exceeds the anticipated expenses of the Trust for the next 12 months and the excess amount is more than $0.01 per Share outstanding, they shall direct the excess amount to be distributed to the Shareholders. Second, if the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution.\nVoting and Approvals\nUnder the Trust Indenture, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. Shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Shares outstanding may vote to remove the Trustee. The Trustee may terminate the Trust upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Indenture require 51% or unanimous consent of the Shareholders.\nBook-Entry Form\nIndividual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, global certificates are deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Indenture, Shareholders are limited to: (1) DTC Participants; (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, or Indirect Participants; and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.\nUnited States Federal Tax Consequences\nThe following discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences that generally apply to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares and gold held by the Trust by a U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), and certain U.S. federal gift and estate tax consequences that generally apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-U.S. Shareholder (as defined below), represents, insofar as it describes conclusions as to U.S. federal tax law and subject to the limitations and qualifications described therein, the opinion of Carter Ledyard & Milburn LLP, special U.S. federal tax counsel to the Sponsor. The discussion below is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to changes either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed herein. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as capital assets within the meaning of Code section 1221. Moreover, the discussion herein does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law on the disposition of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares.\nFor purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Shareholder is a Shareholder that is:\nAn individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\nAn entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;\nAn estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\nA trust, if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust; or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\nA Shareholder (other than a partnership or other entity subject to tax as a partnership) that is not a U.S. Shareholder as defined above is generally considered a Non-U.S. Shareholder for purposes of this discussion. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares.\nTaxation of The Trust\nThe Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trusts income and expenses flow through to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trusts income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) on that basis.\nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders\nU.S. Shareholders generally will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the gold held by the Trust. U.S. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly derived their respective pro rata shares of the Trusts income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the Trusts expenses. In the case of a U.S. Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a U.S. Shareholder that acquires its Shares by delivering gold to the Trust, the delivery of gold to the Trust in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares will not be a taxable event to the U.S. Shareholder, and the U.S. Shareholders tax basis and holding period for the U.S. Shareholders pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the gold delivered by the U.S. Shareholder in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a U.S. Shareholders Shares are acquired on the same date, at the same price per Share and, except where otherwise noted, that the sole asset of the Trust is gold.\nWhen the Trust sells gold, for example to pay expenses, a U.S. Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the U.S. Shareholders pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale; and (2) the U.S. Shareholders tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold that was sold, which gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the U.S. Shareholder has held its Shares for more than one year (see discussion below on the applicable tax rates with respect to such capital gain or loss). A U.S. Shareholders tax basis for its share of any gold sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the U.S. Shareholders total basis for its share of all of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of gold sold and the denominator of which is the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale. Immediately after any such sale, a U.S. Shareholders tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold remaining in the Trust will equal its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the gold that was sold.\nUpon a U.S. Shareholders sale of some or all of its Shares, the U.S. Shareholder will be treated as having sold the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the U.S. Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale of the Shares in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares; and (2) the U.S. Shareholders tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, determined by multiplying the U.S. Shareholders tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares sold and the denominator of which is the number of Shares held by the U.S. Shareholder immediately prior to the sale.\nA redemption of some or all of a U.S. Shareholders Shares in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the U.S. Shareholder. The U.S. Shareholders tax basis for the gold received in the redemption generally will be the same as the U.S. Shareholders tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed. This is determined by multiplying the U.S. Shareholders tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares redeemed and the denominator of which is the number of Shares held by the U.S. Shareholder immediately prior to the redemption. The U.S. Shareholders holding period with respect to the gold received should include the period during which the U.S. Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the gold received by the U.S. Shareholder will be a taxable event.\nImmediately after any sale or redemption of less than all of a U.S. Shareholders Shares, the U.S. Shareholders tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will equal its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption, reduced by the portion of such basis that is attributable to the Shares sold or redeemed, as addressed above.\nAs noted above, the foregoing discussion assumes that all of a U.S. Shareholders Shares were acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. If a U.S. Shareholder owns multiple lots of Shares (i.e., Shares acquired on different dates and/or at different prices), it is uncertain whether the U.S. Shareholder may use the specific identification rules that apply under Treasury regulations section 1.1012-1(c) with respect to sales of shares of stock, in determining the amount, and the long-term or short-term character, of any gain or loss recognized by the U.S. Shareholder upon the sale of gold by the Trust, upon the sale of any Shares by the U.S. Shareholder, or upon the sale by the U.S. Shareholder of any gold received by it upon the redemption of any of its Shares. The IRS could take the position that a U.S. Shareholder has a blended tax basis and holding period for its pro rata share of the underlying gold in the Trust. However, there is no Code section, Regulation or other guidance on this point. U.S. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisors as to the determination of the tax basis and holding period for the underlying gold related to such Shares.\nMaximum 28% Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate for U.S. Shareholders Who are Individuals\nUnder current law, gains recognized by individuals from the sale of collectibles, including gold bullion, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of 28%, rather than the 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. However, if an individual U.S. Shareholder is otherwise subject to a rate lower than 28%, if the gain was ordinary income due to being in a lower bracket, the 28% rate does not apply and such lower rate will apply. For these purposes, a gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of an interest (such as the Shares) in a trust that holds collectibles is treated as gain recognized on the sale of collectibles, to the extent that such gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in the value of the collectibles held by the trust. Therefore, any gain recognized by an individual U.S. Shareholder attributable to a sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trusts sale of any gold bullion that the individual U.S. Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual U.S. Shareholder for one year or less are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. The deductibility of capital losses by an individual U.S. Shareholder is subject to limitations.\n3.8% Tax on Net Investment Income\nUnder current law, U.S. Shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts, whose income exceeds certain thresholds, are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on their net investment income, which generally includes capital gains from the disposition of property. This tax is in addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income (discussed above).\nBrokerage Fees and Trust Expenses\nAny brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a U.S. Shareholder in connection with purchasing Shares will be treated as part of the U.S. Shareholders tax basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a U.S. Shareholder in selling Shares will reduce the amount realized by the U.S. Shareholder with respect to the sale.\nU.S. Shareholders will be required to recognize gain or loss upon a sale of gold by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. U.S. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred such expense. U.S. Shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions. An individual U.S. Shareholder may not deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, an individual U.S. Shareholder may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. In addition, such deductions may be subject to phase-outs and other limitations under applicable provisions of the Code and regulations thereunder and, if the U.S. Shareholder is an individual subject to the alternative minimum tax, may not be deductible at all.\nInvestment by Tax-Exempt U.S. Shareholders\nTax-exempt U.S. Shareholders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax only on their unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). In addition, a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder that is a private foundation is also subject to certain U.S. federal excise taxes, including a 1.39% excise tax under Section 4940 of the Code on its net investment income, which would include any gain recognized on the sale of any of its Shares or its share of any gain recognized on the Trusts sale of gold, provided such gain did not constitute UBTI. Unless a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder incurs debt in order to purchase Shares, it is expected that tax-exempt U.S. Shareholders should not realize UBTI in respect of income or gains from the Shares. Tax-exempt U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors about the U.S. federal income and excise tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares in light of their particular circumstances.\nInvestment by Regulated Investment Companies\nMutual funds and other investment vehicles that are regulated investment companies within the meaning of Code Section 851 should consult with their own tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although the Shares are securities within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying gold for purposes of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code Section 851.\nInvestment by Certain Retirement Plans\nCode Section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a collectible-which is defined to include any metal or gem and any stamp or coin that is not a gold coin described in paragraph (7), (8), (9) , or (10) of section 5112(a) of title 31, United States Code (such gold coin, a Non-Collectible Gold Coin), nor gold bullion of a fineness equal to or exceeding the minimum fineness that a contract market (as described in section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 7) requires for metals that may be delivered in satisfaction of a regulated futures contract if such bullion is in the physical possession of a trustee under Code Section 408(a) (such gold bullion, Non-Collectible Gold Bullion)-by an individual retirement account, or IRA, or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code Section 401(a), is treated as an immediate taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible.\nThe Sponsor has received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that a purchase of Shares by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code Section 401(a) plan (a plan account), will not be treated as the acquisition of a collectible by the IRA or plan, and will not result in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code Section 408(m). However, if Shares are distributed by the trustee or custodian of an IRA or plan account to the IRA owner or participant, or if a redemption of any Shares held by an IRA or plan account results in the distribution of gold to the IRA or account (or such redemption is treated as distributed under Section 408), other than Non-Collectible Gold Coins or Non-Collectible Gold Bullion, such distribution would be taxable to the distributee in the year of distribution to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code Sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. See also ERISA and Related Considerations.\nU.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for U.S. and Non-U.S. Shareholders\nThe Trustee will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provide certain tax-related information to Shareholders, in connection with the Trust. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trusts annual income and gains (if any) and expenses.\nA U.S. Shareholder may be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number (TIN) and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-U.S. Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. persons in order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding tax requirements.\nThe amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholders U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.\nIncome Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders\nThe Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gain (if any) upon the sale of gold. A Non-U.S. Shareholder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of gold by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-U.S. Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and certain other conditions are met; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment). If clause (1) of the preceding sentence applies, the Non-U.S. Shareholder generally will be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain U.S. source losses. If clause (2) of the preceding sentence applies, the Non-U.S. Shareholder will generally be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the sale in the same manner as a U.S. Shareholder, as described above. In addition, corporate Non-U.S. Shareholders may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax on their effectively connected earnings and profits attributable to such gain (subject to adjustments). If a Non-U.S. Shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty between the United States and its country of residence, the tax treatment of any such gain may be modified in the manner specified by the treaty.\nEstate and Gift Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Shareholders\nUnder the U.S. federal estate tax law, individuals who are neither citizens nor residents (as determined for U.S. federal estate and gift tax purposes) of the United States are subject to U.S. federal estate tax on all property that is situated in the U.S. at the time of death. Shares may well be considered to be situated in the U.S. for these purposes. If they are, then Shares would be includible in the U.S. gross estate of a non-resident alien Shareholder. Currently, U.S. federal estate tax is imposed at rates of up to 40% of the fair market value of the taxable estate. The U.S. federal estate tax rate is subject to change in future years. In addition, the U.S. federal generation-skipping transfer tax may apply in certain circumstances. The estate of a non-resident alien Shareholder who was resident in a country that has an estate tax treaty with the United States may be entitled to benefit from such treaty.\nFor non-citizens and non-residents of the United States, the U.S. federal gift tax generally applies only to gifts of tangible personal property or real property that is situated in the United States. Tangible personal property (including gold) is situated in the United States if it is physically located in the United States. Although the matter is not settled, it appears that ownership of Shares should not be considered ownership of the underlying gold for this purpose, even if that gold were held in custody in the United States. Instead, Shares should be considered intangible property, and therefore they should not be subject to U.S. federal gift tax if transferred during the Non-U.S. Shareholders lifetime.\nTaxation in Jurisdictions Other than the United States\nProspective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing in Shares.\nERISA and Related Considerations\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or (ERISA), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements that are subject to ERISA or the Code, including IRAs and annuities, retirement plans for self-employed individuals (so-called Keogh plans), and certain collective investment funds and insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested, collectively the Plans, and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as plan assets of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state or other federal law.\nIn contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan, the Risk Factors discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, including, but not limited to: (1) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument; (2) whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect prohibited transaction with a party in interest or disqualified person, as described in ERISA section 406 or Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, that is not otherwise subject to a statutory exemption or prohibited transaction exemption issued by the Department of Labor; (3) the Plans funding objectives; and (4) whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan, the composition of the Plans investment portfolio and the Plans need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due. The Shares constitute publicly-offered securities as defined in Department of Labor Regulations \u00a7 2510.3- 101(b)(2). Accordingly, Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying gold bullion held in the Trust represented by the Shares, should be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code. See also United States Federal Tax Consequences - Investment by Certain Retirement Plans. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information included in this report, including the Trusts financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Gold\nCrises may motivate large-scale sales of gold which could decrease the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe possibility of large-scale distress sales of gold in times of crisis may have a negative impact on the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. For example, the 2008 financial crisis resulted in significant sales of gold by individuals which depressed the price of gold. Crises in the future may impair golds price performance which would, in turn, adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nSubstantial sales of gold by the official sector could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe official sector consists of central banks, other governmental agencies and international organizations that buy, sell and hold gold as part of their reserve assets. The official sector holds a significant amount of gold, most of which is static, meaning that it is held in vaults and is not bought, sold, leased or swapped or otherwise mobilized in the open market. See The Gold Industry-Sources of Gold Supply and Movements in the Price of Gold for more details. In the event that future economic, political or social conditions or pressures require members of the official sector to liquidate their gold assets all at once or in an uncoordinated manner, the demand for gold might not be sufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in the supply of gold to the market. Consequently, the price of gold could decline significantly, which would adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe price of gold may be affected by the sale of gold by ETFs or other exchange traded vehicles tracking gold markets.\nTo the extent existing exchange traded funds (ETFs) or other exchange traded vehicles tracking gold markets represent a significant proportion of demand for physical gold bullion, large redemptions of the securities of these ETFs or other exchange traded vehicles could negatively affect physical gold bullion prices and the price and NAV of the Shares.\nThe value of the gold held by the Trust is determined using the LBMA Gold Price PM. Potential discrepancies in the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price PM, as well as any future changes to the LBMA Gold Price PM, could impact the value of the gold held by the Trust and could have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in the Shares.\nThe LBMA Gold Price is determined twice each business day (10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. London time) by the participants in a physically settled, electronic and tradable auction administered by the IBA using a bidding process that determines the price of gold by matching buy and sell orders submitted by the participants for the applicable auction time. The net asset value of the Trust is determined each day the Trusts principal market, the NYSE Arca, is open for regular trading, using the LBMA Gold Price PM. If the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the net asset value of the Trust. The Trust, the Sponsor, and the Trustee do not participate in establishing the LBMA Gold Price. Other trusts backed by physical gold also use the LBMA Gold Price to determine their asset value. The LBMA Gold Price replaced the London Gold Fix on March 20, 2015 and has become a widely used benchmark for daily gold prices.\nIn the event that the LBMA Gold Price PM does not prove to be an accurate benchmark, and the LBMA Gold Price PM varies materially from the price determined by other mechanisms, the Net Asset Value of the Trust and the value of an investment in the Shares could be adversely impacted. Any future developments in the benchmark, to the extent they have a material impact on the LBMA Gold Price PM, could adversely impact the Net Asset Value of the Trust and the value of an investment in the Shares. Further, the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price PM is not an exact process. Rather it is based upon a procedure of matching orders from participants in the auction process and their customers to sell gold with orders from participants in the auction process and their customers to buy gold at particular prices. The LBMA Gold Price PM does not therefore purport to reflect each buyer or seller of gold in the market, nor does it purport to set a definitive price for gold at which all orders for sale or purchase will take place on that particular day or time. All orders placed into the auction process by the participants will be executed on the basis of the price determined pursuant to the LBMA Gold Price PM auction process (provided that orders may be cancelled, increased or decreased while the auction is in progress). It is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events may occur that could result in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the system to produce, an LBMA Gold Price PM on any given date.\nRisks Related to the Custody of Gold\nThe Trusts gold may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of the Trusts gold bars held by the Custodians or any subcustodian on behalf of the Trust could be lost, damaged or stolen. Access to the Trusts gold bars could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these events may adversely affect the operations of the Trust and, consequently, an investment in the Shares.\nThe Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its gold is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed and recovery may be limited, even in the event of fraud, to the market value of the gold at the time the fraud is discovered.\nShareholders recourse against the Trust, the Trustee and the Sponsor, under New York law, the Custodians, under English law, and any subcustodians under the law governing their custody operations is limited. The Trust does not insure its gold. Each Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate which does not cover the full amount of gold held by them. The Trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence, nature or amount of coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodians will maintain adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold held by the Custodians on behalf of the Trust. In addition, the Custodians and the Trustee do not require any direct or indirect subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities or in respect of the gold held by them on behalf of the Trust. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trusts gold which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages.\nThe liability of the Custodians is limited under the Custody Agreements. Under the HSBC Custody Agreements, HSBC is only liable for losses that are the direct result of its own negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. HSBC's liability is further limited, in the case of the HSBC Allocated Account Agreement, to the market value of the gold bars held in the Trusts allocated gold account at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by HSBC and, in the case of the HSBC Unallocated Account Agreement, to the amount of gold credited to the Trusts unallocated gold account at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by HSBC. HSBC is not contractually or otherwise liable for any losses suffered by any Authorized Participant that are not the direct result of its own gross negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties under the Authorized Participant's unallocated bullion account agreement with HSBC, and in no event will its liability exceed the market value of the balance in the Authorized Participant's unallocated account with HSBC at the time such gross negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered by HSBC. Under the JPMorgan Custody Agreements, JPMorgan is only liable for losses that are the direct result of its own negligence, fraud or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties, and JPMorgan's liability is limited to the aggregate market value of the Trust's allocated account balances and the Trust's unallocated account balance at the time of such negligence, fraud or willful misconduct.\nIn addition, neither Custodian will be liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance of any of its obligations under the Custody Agreements by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control. As a result, the recourse of the Trustee or the investor, under English law, is limited. Furthermore, under English common law, the Custodians or any subcustodian will not be liable for any delay in the performance or any non-performance of its custodial obligations by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control.\nGold bars may be held by one or more subcustodians appointed by the Custodians, or in the case of HSBC, employed by the subcustodians appointed by HSBC, until the gold is transported to the applicable Custodians London vault premises. Under the HSBC Custody Agreements, except for an obligation on the part of HSBC to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of the Trusts gold bars from any subcustodians appointed by HSBC, HSBC is not liable for the acts or omissions of its subcustodians unless the selection of such subcustodians was made negligently or in bad faith.\nThe obligations of the Custodians under the Custody Agreements, and the obligations of HSBC under each Authorized Participants unallocated bullion account agreement with HSBC, are governed by English law. The Custodians may enter into arrangements with subcustodians, which arrangements may also be governed by English law. The Trust is a New York investment trust. Any federal, New York, or other court situated in the United States may have difficulty interpreting English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements, is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute), LBMA rules or the customs and practices in the London custody market. It may be difficult or impossible for the Trust to sue a subcustodian in a United States, New York or other court situated in the United States. In addition, it may be difficult, time consuming and/or expensive for the Trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a federal, New York, or other court situated in the United States.\nIf any subcustodian which holds gold on a temporary basis does not exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trusts gold bars, the ability of the Trustee or the Custodians to recover damages against such subcustodian may be limited to only such recourse, if any, as may be available under applicable English law or other applicable law. If the Trustees or a Custodians recourse against the subcustodian is so limited, the Trust may not be adequately compensated for the loss. For more information on the Trustees and each Custodians ability to seek recovery against subcustodians, the use of subcustodians and the subcustodians duty to safekeep the Trusts gold bars, see Custody of the Trusts Gold.\nIf the Trusts gold bars are lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Trust, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trusts claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust might be limited to the Custodians or one or more subcustodians, if appointed; or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust.\nNeither the Shareholders nor any Authorized Participant has a right under the Custody Agreements to assert a claim of the Trustee against the Custodians or any subcustodian; claims under the Custody Agreements may only be asserted by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust.\nBecause the Trustee and the Custodians do not oversee or monitor the activities of subcustodians who may temporarily hold the Trusts gold bars until transported to a Custodians London vault premises, failure by the subcustodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trusts gold bars could result in a loss to the Trust.\nUnder the Custody Agreements, each of the Custodians agrees to hold all of the Trusts gold bars in its own vault premises except when the gold bars have been allocated in a vault other than the Custodians vault premises, and in such cases each Custodian agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to transport the gold bars to the Custodians London vault, at the Custodians cost and risk. Nevertheless, there may be periods of time when some portion of the Trusts gold bars are held by one or more subcustodians appointed by a Custodian or, in the case of HSBC, by a subcustodian of such subcustodian. The Custody Agreements are described in Description of the Custody Agreements.\nBoth Custodians are required to use reasonable care in appointing their subcustodians. While JPMorgan remains liable for any loss suffered by the Trust as a result of any act or omission or insolvency of any subcustodian, including to the extent directly resulting from JPMorgan's fraud or negligence in the appointment of that subcustodian, HSBC does not have any additional responsibility in relation to the subcustodians appointed by it, except to the extent of losses which directly result from HSBC's fraud, negligence or bad faith in the appointment of the relevant subcustodian. Subcustodians appointed by HSBC may appoint further subcustodians, but HSBC is not responsible for the appointment of these further subcustodians.\nHSBC does not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their custody functions or their selection of further subcustodians. JPMorgan will notify the Trustee and the Sponsor of any difficulties or problems existing with a subcustodian of which JPMorgan becomes aware, but is not otherwise obligated to monitor the performance of a subcustodian. The Trustee does not undertake to monitor the performance of any subcustodian. Furthermore, the Trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any subcustodian for the purposes of examining the Trusts gold bars or any records maintained by the subcustodian, and no subcustodian will be obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such subcustodian. See Custody of the Trusts Gold for more information about subcustodians that may hold the Trusts gold.\nIn addition, the ability of the Trustee to monitor the performance of the Custodians may be limited because, under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee has only limited rights to visit the premises of each Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trusts gold bars and certain related records maintained by the Custodian.\nThe ability of the Trustee and the Custodians to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited, which increases the possibility that the Trust may suffer a loss if a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of the Trusts gold bars.\nIf any subcustodian which holds gold on a temporary basis does not exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trusts gold bars, the ability of the Trustee or the Custodians to recover damages against such subcustodian may be limited to only such recourse, if any, as may be available under applicable English law or, if the subcustodian is not located in England, under other applicable law. This is because there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements between subcustodians who may hold the Trusts gold bars and the Trustee or the Custodians, as the case may be. If the Trustees or a Custodians recourse against the subcustodian is so limited, the Trust may not be adequately compensated for the loss. For more information on the use of subcustodians, the Trustees and the Custodians' ability to seek recovery against subcustodians, and the subcustodians duty to safekeep the Trusts gold bars, see Custody of the Trusts Gold.\nGold held in the Trusts unallocated gold accounts with the Custodians and any Authorized Participants unallocated gold account with a Custodian or another LPMCL gold clearing bank will not be segregated from the assets of the relevant Custodian or LPMCL gold clearing bank. If a Custodian or another LPMCL gold clearing bank becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant, as applicable. In addition, in the event of a Custodians insolvency, there may be a delay and costs incurred in identifying the gold bars held in the Trusts allocated gold account with the Custodian.\nGold which is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution will be held for a time in the Trust's unallocated accounts with the Custodians and, previously or subsequently, in the Authorized Participant's unallocated account with a Custodian or another LPMCL gold clearing bank. During those times, the Trust and the Authorized Participant, as the case may be, will have no proprietary rights to any specific bars of gold held by a Custodian or another LPMCL gold clearing bank and will each be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian or the other LPMCL gold clearing bank, as applicable, with respect to the amount of gold held in their respective unallocated accounts. In addition, if a Custodian fails to allocate the Trusts gold in a timely manner, in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the unallocated account agreement with the Custodian, or if a subcustodian fails to so segregate gold held by it on behalf of the Trust, unallocated gold will not be segregated from the Custodians assets, and the Trust will be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount so held in the event of the insolvency of the Custodian. In the event a Custodian or another LPMCL gold clearing bank becomes insolvent, the assets of the relevant Custodian or LPMCL gold clearing bank might not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or the Authorized Participant, as applicable, for the amount of gold held in their respective unallocated gold accounts.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a Custodian, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the gold held in all of the accounts held by the Custodian, including the Trust's allocated account with that Custodian. Although the Trust would retain legal title to the allocated gold bars, the Trust could incur expenses in connection with obtaining control of the allocated gold bars, and the assertion of a claim by such liquidator for unpaid fees due to the Custodian could delay creations and redemptions of Baskets.\nThe gold bullion custody operations of the Custodians are not subject to specific governmental regulatory supervision.\nEach Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trusts gold bullion that the Custodian allocates to the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets by Authorized Participants. Each Custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through unallocated gold accounts it maintains for the Trust and may maintain for Authorized Participants. Although both Custodians are market makers, clearers and approved weighers under the rules of the LBMA (which sets out good practices for participants in the bullion market), the LBMA is not an official or governmental regulatory body. Furthermore, although the Custodians are subject to general banking regulations by U.S. regulators and generally regulated in the U.K. by the PRA and the FCA, such regulations do not directly cover the Custodians' gold bullion custody operations in the U.K. Accordingly, the Trust is dependent on the Custodians to comply with the best practices of the LBMA and to implement satisfactory internal controls for its gold bullion custody operations in order to keep the Trusts gold secure.\nGeneral Risks\nThe Trust relies on the information and technology systems of the Trustee, the Custodians, the Marketing Agent and, to a lesser degree, the Sponsor, which could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on the record keeping and operations of the Trust.\nThe Custodians, the Trustee and the Marketing Agent depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network, hardware and software systems to conduct their business as it relates to the Trust. A cybersecurity incident, or a failure to protect their computer systems, networks and information against cybersecurity threats, could result in a loss of information and adversely impact their ability to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Trust. Despite implementation of network and other cybersecurity measures, their security measures may not be adequate to protect against all cybersecurity threats.\nThe Trust as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of geopolitical events, including the Israel-Hamas war, the continuation of the war in Ukraine and other hostilities.\nGeopolitical events, including the Israel-Hamas war, the continuation of the war in Ukraine and other hostilities could disrupt and potentially impact the business activities of the Sponsor and its service providers and have an adverse effect on the Trust.\nOn October 7, 2023, militants from Gaza attacked Israeli towns, killed Israeli civilians and soldiers and took hostages. In response to the attack, Israel declared war against Hamas, attacking Hamas and Islamic targets in Gaza. The responses of countries and political bodies to these events, the larger overarching tensions, Israel's military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally, have adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of gold and the price of the Shares. In addition, the conflict, along with any global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions, collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict, could disturb the gold market.\nIn late February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other countries in the region and in the west. On March 7, 2022, the LBMA suspended its accreditation of six Russian precious metals refiners. The LBMA stated that existing bars produced by the refiners before their suspension will still be accepted as good delivery. Following an announcement at the G7 Summit to collectively ban the import of Russian gold, the UK passed regulations which prohibit the direct or indirect (i) import of gold that originated in Russia, (ii) acquisition of gold that originated in Russia or is located in Russia and (iii) supply or delivery of gold that originated in Russia, all after July 21, 2022. Similarly, US regulations prohibit the import of gold of Russian origin into the United States on or after June 28, 2022 and EU regulations prohibit the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of gold if it originates in Russia and has been exported from Russia after July 22, 2022.\nThe responses of countries and political bodies to Russias actions, the larger overarching tensions, and Ukraines military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally, have adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of gold and the price of the Shares. In addition, the conflict in Ukraine, along with global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions, collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict beyond Ukraines borders, could disturb the gold market.\nThe Trust as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of public health crises such as the coronavirus pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic).\nPandemics and other public health crises may cause a curtailment of business activities which may potentially impact the ability of the Sponsor and its service providers to operate. The COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat could adversely impact the Trust by causing operating delays and disruptions, market disruption and shutdowns (including as a result of government regulation and prevention measures). The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, had substantive effects on social, economic and financial systems, including significant uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust.\nConflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust and its Shareholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the Trust and its Shareholders. As an example, the Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust.\nRisks Related to the Shares\nThe value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the gold held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of gold could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe Shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of gold, and the value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the gold held by the Trust, less the Trusts liabilities (including estimated accrued expenses). The price of gold has fluctuated widely over the past several years. Several factors may affect the price of gold, including:\nGlobal gold supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as golds uses in jewelry, technology and industrial applications, purchases made by investors in the form of bars, coins and other gold products, forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries such as China, the United States and Australia;\nGlobal or regional political, economic or financial events and situations, especially those unexpected in nature;\nInvestors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;\nCurrency exchange rates;\nInterest rates;\nInvestment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and\nOther economic variables such as income growth, economic output, and monetary policies.\nThe Shares have experienced significant price fluctuations. If gold markets continue to be subject to sharp fluctuations, this may result in potential losses if you need to sell your Shares at a time when the price of gold is lower than it was when you made your investment. Even if you are able to hold Shares for the long-term, you may never experience a profit, since gold markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices, in addition to sharp fluctuations.\nIn addition, investors should be aware that while gold is used to preserve wealth by investors around the world, there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately.\nIf concerns about the integrity or reliability of the LBMA Gold Price PM arise, even if eventually shown to be without merit, such concerns could adversely affect investor interest in gold and therefore adversely affect the price of gold and the value of an investment in the Shares.\nBecause the net asset value of the Trust is determined using the LBMA Gold Price PM, discrepancies in, or manipulation of the calculation of the LBMA Gold Price PM could have an adverse impact on the value of an investment in the Shares. Furthermore, any concern about the integrity or reliability of the pricing mechanism could disrupt trading in gold and products using the LBMA Gold Price PM, such as the Shares. In addition, these concerns could potentially lead to changes in the manner in which the LBMA Gold Price PM is calculated and/or the discontinuance of the LBMA Gold Price PM altogether. Each of these factors could lead to less liquidity or greater price volatility for gold and products using the LBMA Gold Price PM, such as the Shares, or otherwise could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Shares.\nThe amount of gold represented by the Shares will continue to be reduced during the life of the Trust due to the sales of gold necessary to pay the Trusts expenses irrespective of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold.\nEach outstanding Share represents a fractional, undivided interest in the gold held by the Trust. The Trust does not generate any income and regularly sells gold to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of gold represented by each Share has gradually declined over time. This is also true with respect to Shares that are issued in exchange for additional deposits of gold into the Trust, as the amount of gold required to create Shares proportionately reflects the amount of gold represented by the Shares outstanding at the time of creation. Assuming a constant gold price, the trading price of the Shares is expected to gradually decline relative to the price of gold as the amount of gold represented by the Shares gradually declines.\nInvestors should be aware that the gradual decline in the amount of gold represented by the Shares will occur regardless of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold. The estimated ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, which accrue daily commencing after the first day of trading of the Shares, are described in Trust Expenses.\nThe Trust is a passive investment vehicle. This means that the value of the Shares may be adversely affected by Trust losses that, if the Trust had been actively managed, it might have been possible to avoid.\nThe Trustee does not actively manage the gold held by the Trust. This means that the Trustee does not sell gold at times when its price is high or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. It also means that the Trustee does not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from price decreases. Any losses sustained by the Trust will adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Shares may trade at a price which is at, above or below the NAV per Share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent trading hours between the COMEX and NYSE Arca.\nThe Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV per Share. The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trusts assets. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the COMEX and NYSE Arca. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 8:00 PM New York time, liquidity in the global gold market may be reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen.\nThe sale of the Trusts gold to pay expenses at a time of low gold prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Trustee sells gold held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses on an as-needed basis irrespective of then-current gold prices. The Trust is not actively managed, and no attempt will be made to buy or sell gold to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of gold. Consequently, the Trusts gold may be sold at a time when the gold price is low, resulting in a negative effect on the value of the Shares.\nShareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the protections afforded by the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not required to register under such act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in registered investment companies. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA) as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC). Furthermore, the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and none of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Marketing Agent is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated instruments or commodity pools.\nThe Trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders.\nIf the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time which is disadvantageous to Shareholders, such as when gold prices are lower than the gold prices at the time when Shareholders purchased their Shares. In such a case, when the Trusts gold is sold as part of the Trusts liquidation, the resulting proceeds distributed to Shareholders will be less than if gold prices were higher at the time of sale.\nThe liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal of Authorized Participants.\nIn the event that one of more Authorized Participants which has substantial interests in the Shares withdraws from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares.\nThe lack of an active trading market or a halt in trading of the Shares may result in losses on investment at the time of disposition of the Shares.\nAlthough Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, it cannot be assumed that an active trading market for the Shares will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell Shares at a time when no active market for Shares exists, or there is a halt in trading of securities generally or of the Shares, this will most likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the Shares (assuming the investor is able to sell them).\nRedemption orders are subject to postponement, suspension or rejection by the Trustee under certain circumstances.\nThe Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the delivery, disposal or evaluation of gold is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of Shareholders. In addition, the Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. Any such postponement, suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Shareholder. For example, the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the Shareholders redemption distribution if the price of the Shares declines during the period of the delay. See Creation and Redemption of Shares-Redemption Procedures. Under the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor and the Trustee disclaim any liability for any loss or damage that may result from any such suspension or postponement.\nShareholders do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles.\nAs interests in an investment trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). In addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends). See Description of the Shares for a description of the limited rights of holders of Shares.\nAn investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in gold.\nThe Trust competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold industry and other securities backed by or linked to gold, direct investments in gold and investment vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsors control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in gold directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares.\nThe Trusts obligation to reimburse the Marketing Agent and the Authorized Participants for certain liabilities in the event the Sponsor fails to indemnify such parties could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Marketing Agent, its partners, directors and officers, and any person who controls the Marketing Agent, and its respective successors and assigns, against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim that may be incurred by the Marketing Agent in connection with (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement of which this report forms a part (including this report, any preliminary prospectus, any prospectus supplement and any exhibits thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made by the Sponsor with respect to any representations and warranties or any covenants under the Marketing Agent Agreement, or failure of the Sponsor to perform any agreement or covenant therein; (3) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any materials used in connection with the marketing of the Shares; (4) circumstances surrounding the third party allegations relating to patent and contract disputes; or (5) the Marketing Agents performance of its duties under the Marketing Agent Agreement, and to contribute to payments that the Marketing Agent may be required to make in respect thereof. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Marketing Agent, solely from and to the extent of the Trusts assets, for indemnification and contribution due under the preceding sentence to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts directly when due. Under the Participant Agreement, the Sponsor also has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and to contribute to payments that the Authorized Participants may be required to make in respect of such liabilities. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse the Authorized Participants, solely from and to the extent of the Trusts assets, for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the Sponsor in respect of such liabilities to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts when due. In the event the Trust is required to pay any such amounts, the Trustee would be required to sell assets of the Trust to cover the amount of any such payment and the NAV of the Trust would be reduced accordingly, thus adversely affecting an investment in the Shares.\nUnder the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor may be able to seek indemnification from the Trust for payments it makes in connection with the Sponsors activities under the Trust Indenture to the extent its conduct does not disqualify it from receiving such indemnification under the terms of the Trust Indenture. The Sponsor will also be indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense arising under the Marketing Agent Agreement or any Participant Agreement insofar as such loss, liability or expense arises from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any written statement provided to the Sponsor by the Trustee.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nThe Trusts Shares have been listed on the NYSE Arca under the symbol GLD since December 13, 2007, after a transfer from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) where the Shares were listed since its initial public offering on November 18, 2004. The Shares have traded on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores) since August 10, 2006, the Singapore Exchange Limited since October 11, 2006, the Tokyo Stock Exchange since June 30, 2008 and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited since July 31, 2008.\nHolders of Record\nAs of October 31, 2023, there were approximately 188 DTC participating shareholders of record of the Trust. Because most of the Trusts Shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders.\nIssuer Purchase of Shares\nAlthough the Trust does not purchase Shares directly from its shareholders, in connection with its redemption of Baskets, the Trust redeemed 86,600,000 Shares (866 Baskets) during the year ended September 30, 2023, including 24,000,000 Shares (240 Baskets) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as set forth in the table below.\nTotal number of\nAverage ounces\nPeriod\nShares redeemed\nof gold per Share\n7/1/23 to 7/31/23\n6,400,000\n0.09284\n8/1/23 to 8/31/23\n10,800,000\n0.09281\n9/1/23 to 9/30/23\n6,800,000\n0.09278\nTOTAL\n24,000,000\n0.09281 Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTrust Overview\nSPDR\u00ae Gold Trust is an investment trust that was formed November 12, 2004. The Trust issues Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with the redemption of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trusts operations. The Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost effective and convenient way to invest in gold.\nGold is held on behalf of the Trust by HSBC and JPMorgan.\nAs of the date of this annual report, Goldman, Sachs & Co. LLC, Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas LLC are the only Authorized Participants. An updated list of Authorized Participants can be obtained from the Trustee or the Sponsor.\nInvesting in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The following chart illustrates the movement in the price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares against the corresponding gold price (per 1/10 of an oz. of gold) since the day the Shares first began trading on the NYSE and subsequent transfer to NYSE Arca:\nShare price & NAV v. gold price - November 18, 2004 to September 30, 2023\nThe divergence of the price of the Shares and NAV of the Shares from the gold price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the Trust expenses that arise if an investment had been held since inception.\nCritical Accounting Policy\nValuation of Gold, Definition of Net Asset Value\nThe Trustee values the gold held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price PM is announced on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. In the event the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that such price is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trusts gold, they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the Trustee. While we believe that the LBMA Gold Price is an appropriate indicator of the value of gold, there are other indicators that are available that could be different than the LBMA Gold Price. The use of such an alternative indicator could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold in the Trust which could result in different market adjustments or redemption value adjustments of our outstanding redeemable Shares.\nOnce the value of the gold has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trusts reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on NYSE Arca.\nInspectorate conducts two counts each year of the gold bullion held on behalf of the Trust at the vaults of the Custodians. A complete bar count is conducted once per year and coincides with the Trusts financial year end at September 30th. Inspectorate concluded the annual full count of the Trusts gold bullion held by (i) HSBC at its London vault on October 2, 2023, (ii) JPMorgan at its London vault on October 2, 2023 and (iii) JPMorgan at its New York vault on October 2, 2023. The second count is a random sample count and is conducted at a date which falls within the same financial year and was conducted most recently at JPMorgan's London vault on March 24, 2023 and at HSBC's London vault on April 5, 2023.

Trading of the Trusts Shares commenced on November 18, 2004. In the year ended September 30, 2023, an additional 65,000,000 Shares (650 Baskets), were created in exchange for 6,042,651 ounces of gold, and 86,600,000 Shares (866 Baskets) were redeemed in exchange for 8,048,977 ounces of gold. For accounting purposes, the Trust reflects creations and the gold receivable with respect to such creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation but does not deliver Shares until the requisite amount of gold is received. Upon a redemption, the Trust delivers gold upon receipt of Shares. All references in this discussion to gold receivable and gold payable relate to creations and redemptions that had not been completed. These creations and redemptions were completed in the normal course of business, including the receipt and payment of the gold by the Custodian.\nAs at September 30, 2023, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by the Custodians on behalf of the Trust in their vaults was 28,088,298 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $52,539,160,689 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2023 (cost -$47,094,462,787).\nAs at September 30, 2022, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by HSBC, as the only custodian at the time, in its vault was 30,323,468 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $50,693,257,111 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2022 (cost -$49,274,427,022).\nAs at September 30, 2021, the amount of gold owned by the Trust and held by HSBC, as the only custodian at the time, in its vault was 31,830,401 ounces, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of London Good Delivery gold bars with a market value of $55,474,022,504 based on the LBMA Gold Price PM on September 30, 2021 (cost -$49,227,343,846).\nCash Flow from Operations\nThe Trust had no net cash flow from operations in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash received in respect of gold sold to pay expenses in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was the same as those expenses, resulting in a zero cash balance at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Resources and Liquidity\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022 the Trust did not have any cash balances. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Trustee endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trusts holdings of assets other than gold. As a consequence, we expect that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period.\nAnalysis of Movements in the Price of Gold\nAs movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the Trusts Shares, investors should understand what the recent movements in the price of gold have been. Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements. This section identifies recent movements in the gold price.\nThe following chart provides historical background on the price of gold. The chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2023 and is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM.\nDaily Gold Price - October 1, 2018 - September 30, 2023\nLBMA Gold Price PM USD\nThe average high, low and end-of-period gold prices for the three and twelve-month periods over the prior three years and for the period from November 12, 2004 (the date of inception of the Trust) through September 30, 2023, based on the LBMA Gold Price when available from March 20, 2015 and previously the London Fix, were:\nLast\nEnd of\nbusiness\nPeriod\nAverage\nHigh\nDate\nLow\nDate\nperiod\nday(1)\nThree months to December 31, 2020\n$ 1,874.23\n$ 1,940.80\nNov 6, 2020\n$ 1,762.55\nNov 30, 2020\n$ 1,891.10\nDec 31, 2020\n(2)\nThree months to March 31, 2021\n$ 1,794.01\n$ 1,943.20\nJan 4, 2021\n$ 1,683.95\nMar 30, 2021\n$ 1,691.05\nMar 31, 2021\nThree months to June 30, 2021\n$ 1,816.48\n$ 1,902.75\nJun 2, 2021\n$ 1,726.05\nApr 1, 2021\n$ 1,763.15\nJun 30, 2021\nThree months to September 30, 2021\n$ 1,789.52\n$ 1,829.30\nJul 29, 2021\n$ 1,723.35\nAug 10, 2021\n$ 1,742.80\nSep 30, 2021\nThree months to December 31, 2021\n$ 1,795.25\n$ 1,864.90\nNov 17, 2021\n$ 1,753.20\nOct 5, 2021\n$ 1,820.10\nDec 31, 2021\n(2)\nThree months to March 31, 2022\n$ 1,877.16\n$ 2,039.05\nMar 8, 2022\n$ 1,788.15\nJan 28, 2022\n$ 1,942.15\nMar 31, 2022\nThree months to June 30, 2022\n$ 1,870.58\n$ 1,976.75\nApr 13, 2022\n$ 1,809.50\nMay 16, 2022\n$ 1,817.00\nJun 30, 2022\nThree months to September 30, 2022\n$ 1,728.91\n$ 1,808.40\nJul 4, 2022\n$ 1,634.30\nSep 27, 2022\n$ 1,671.75\nSep 30, 2022\nThree months to December 31, 2022\n$ 1,725.85\n$ 1,823.55\nDec 13, 2022\n$ 1,628.75\nNov 3, 2022\n$ 1,812.35\nDec 30, 2022\n(2)\nThree months to March 31, 2023\n$ 1,889.92\n$ 1,993.80\nMar 24, 2023\n$ 1,810.95\nFeb 24, 2023\n$ 1,979.70\nMar 31, 2023\nThree months to June 30, 2023\n$ 1,975.93\n$ 2,048.45\nApr 13, 2023\n$ 1,899.60\nJun 29, 2023\n$ 1,912.25\nJun 30, 2023\nThree months to September 30, 2023\n$ 1,928.23\n$ 1,976.10\nJul 20, 2023\n$ 1,870.50\nSep 29, 2023\n$ 1,870.50\nSep 29, 2023\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2021\n$ 1,818.12\n$ 1,943.20\nJan 4, 2021\n$ 1,683.95\nMar 30, 2021\n$ 1,742.80\nSep 30, 2021\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2022\n$ 1,817.08\n$ 2,039.05\nMar 8, 2022\n$ 1,634.30\nSep 27, 2022\n$ 1,671.75\nSep 30, 2022\nTwelve months ended September 30, 2023\n$ 1,880.36\n$ 2,048.45\nApr 13, 2023\n$ 1,628.75\nNov 3, 2022\n$ 1,870.50\nSep 29, 2023\nNovember 12, 2004 to September 30, 2023\n$ 1,267.53\n$ 2,067.15\nAug 6, 2020\n$ 411.10\nFeb 8, 2005\n$ 1,870.50\nSep 29, 2023\n(1)\nThe end of period gold price is the LBMA Gold Price PM on the last business day of the period.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere have been no changes in accountants and no disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosures during the year ended September 30, 2023. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Sponsor, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChange in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Trusts internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Trusts most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Sponsors management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trusts internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trusts assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trusts receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trusts assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nKPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023 included in this Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is included herein, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nNovember 22, 2023\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Trustee of SPDR\u00ae Gold Trust and the Board of Directors of World Gold Trust Services, LLC:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited SPDR\u00ae Gold Trusts (the Trust) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the statements of financial condition of the Trust, including the schedules of investment, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements), and our report dated November 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe management of World Gold Trust Services, LLC (the Trusts sponsor) is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trusts internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAn entitys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entitys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entitys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nNew York, New York\nNovember 22, 2023 Item 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, its cash flows, and changes in its net assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of World Gold Trust Services, LLC (the Trusts sponsor). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings\nAs disclosed in the schedule of investment, as of September 30, 2023, the Trusts market value of gold holdings was $52.5 billion, representing 100% of the Trusts total assets. All of the gold holdings, which were 28.1 million ounces as of September 30, 2023, were held by third-party custodians (the custodians).\nWe identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the gold holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the gold holdings, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the quantity of gold held by the custodians as of September 30, 2023.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Trusts gold holdings process, including controls over (1) the comparison of the Trusts records of gold held to the custodians' records and (2) the approval of gold deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of the Trust. We obtained a schedule directly from the custodians of the Trusts gold holdings held by the custodians as of September 30, 2023. We compared the total ounces on such schedule to the Trusts record of gold holdings. We also attended and observed part of the physical count of the Trusts gold holdings performed at the custodians' locations by a third party engaged by the Trusts sponsor. We obtained the physical count result of that third party and reconciled it to both the Trusts and the custodians' records.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Trusts auditor since 2010.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 22, 2023\nSPDR\u00ae GOLD TRUST\nStatements of Financial Condition\nat September 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Amounts in 000s of US$ except for share and per share data)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nASSETS\nInvestments in Gold, at fair value (cost $47,094,463 and $49,274,427 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively)\n$ 52,539,161 $ 50,693,257\nTotal Assets\n$ 52,539,161 $ 50,693,257\nLIABILITIES\nAccounts payable to Sponsor\n$ 17,892 $ 17,074\nGold payable\n- 185,723\nTotal Liabilities\n$ 17,892 $ 202,797\nNet Assets\n$ 52,521,269 $ 50,490,460\nShares issued and outstanding(1)\n302,700,000 324,300,000\nNet asset value per Share\n$ 173.51 $ 155.69\n(1) Authorized share capital is unlimited and the par value of the Shares is $0.00.\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nSPDR\u00ae GOLD TRUST\nSchedules of Investment\n(Amounts in 000s except for percentages)\nSeptember 30, 2023\nOunces of gold\nCost\nFair Value\n% of Net Assets\nInvestment in Gold\n28,088 $ 47,094,463 $ 52,539,161 100.03 %\nTotal Investment\n$ 47,094,463 $ 52,539,161 100.03 %\nLiabilities in excess of other assets\n(17,892 ) (0.03 )%\nNet Assets\n$ 52,521,269 100.00 %\nSeptember 30, 2022\nOunces of gold\nCost\nFair Value\n% of Net Assets\nInvestment in Gold\n30,324 $ 49,274,427 $ 50,693,257 100.40 %\nTotal Investment\n$ 49,274,427 $ 50,693,257 100.40 %\nLiabilities in excess of other assets\n(202,797 ) (0.40 )%\nNet Assets\n$ 50,490,460 100.00 %\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nF-\nSPDR\u00ae GOLD TRUST\nStatements of Operations\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and 2021\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\n(Amounts in 000s of US$, except per share data)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nSep-30, 2021\nEXPENSES\nSponsor fees\n$ 221,609 $ 238,497 $ 257,595\nTotal expenses\n221,609 238,497 257,595\nNet investment loss\n(221,609 ) (238,497 ) (257,595 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\nNet realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay expenses\n26,600 30,323 43,413\nNet realized gain/(loss) from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n1,717,329 2,091,493 4,455,284\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n4,025,868 (4,827,849 ) (9,987,571 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n5,769,797 (2,706,033 ) (5,488,874 )\nNet income/(loss)\n$ 5,548,188 $ (2,944,530 ) $ (5,746,469 )\nNet income/(loss) per share\n$ 17.50 $ (8.39 ) $ (15.25 )\nWeighted average number of shares (in 000s)\n316,955 350,920 376,931\nSee notes to the financial statements.\nSPDR\u00ae GOLD TRUST\nStatements of Cash Flows\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and 2021\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nSep-30, 2021\nINCREASE/DECREASE IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS:\nCash proceeds received from sales of gold\n$ 220,791 $ 240,172 $ 264,295\nCash expenses paid\n(220,791 ) (240,172 ) (264,295 )\nIncrease/(Decrease) in cash resulting from operations\n- -

The fiscal year end for the Trust is September 30th. The Trust holds gold and is expected from time to time to issue shares (Shares) (in minimum denominations of 100,000 Shares, also referred to as Baskets) in exchange for deposits of gold and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Trusts expenses. World Gold Trust Services, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor). BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon, is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee). State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC is the marketing agent of the Trust (the Marketing Agent). HSBC Bank plc (\"HSBC\") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMorgan\") are the custodians of the Trust (each a \"Custodian\" and together, the Custodians).\nThe Shares trade on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca) under the symbol GLD, providing investors with an efficient means to obtain market exposure to the price of gold bullion. The Shares are also listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), the Singapore Exchange Limited and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nThe Trustee does not actively manage the gold held by the Trust. This means that the Trustee does not sell gold at times when its price is high or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. It also means that the Trustee does not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from price decreases. Any losses sustained by the Trust will adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.\n2.1.\nBasis of Accounting\nFor accounting purposes only, the Trust is an investment company and, therefore, applies the specialized accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.\n2.2.\nFair Value Measurement\nFASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, provides a single definition of fair value, a hierarchy for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value adjustments.\nThe Trust does not hold any derivative instruments, and its assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and, from time to time, (i) gold receivable, representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the Trusts account and (ii) cash, which is used to pay expenses.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price the Trust would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Trusts policy is to value its investments at fair value.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities. Inputs may be based on independent market data (observable inputs) or they may be internally developed (unobservable inputs). These inputs are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes. The level of a value determined for an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability, including the Trusts assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments.\nF-\nThe following table summarizes the Trusts investments at fair value:\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSeptember 30, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nInvestment in Gold\n$ 52,539,161 $ - $ -\nTotal\n$ 52,539,161 $ - $ -\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nInvestment in Gold\n$ 50,693,257 $ - $ -\nTotal\n$ 50,693,257 $ - $ -\nThere were no transfers between Level 1 and other Levels for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold as determined by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA), a benchmark administrator, which provides an independently administered auction process as well as the overall administration and governance for the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). In determining the net asset value (NAV) of the Trust, the Trustee values the gold held by the Trust on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the IBA 3:00 PM auction process (LBMA Gold Price PM), which is an electronic auction, with the imbalance calculated, and the price adjusted in rounds (30 seconds in duration). The auction runs twice daily at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM London time. The Trustee determines the NAV of the Trust on each day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at the earlier of the LBMA Gold Price PM for the day or 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is used in the determination of the NAV of the Trust, unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such a price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination.\n2.3.\nCustody of Gold\nGold is held by the Custodians on behalf of the Trust, 100% of which is allocated gold in the form of good delivery gold bars. A current list of all gold held by the Custodians, including any held with a subcustodian, is available on the Sponsors website at www.spdrgoldshares.com.\n2.4.\nGold Receivable\nGold receivable represents the quantity of gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the Trusts account. Generally, ownership of the gold is transferred within two business days of the trade date.\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nGold receivable\n$ - $ -\n2.5.\nGold Payable\nGold payable represents the quantity of gold covered by contractually binding orders for the redemption of Shares where the gold has not yet been transferred out of the Trusts account. Generally, ownership of the gold is transferred within two business days of the trade date.\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nGold payable\n$ - $ 185,723\n2.6.\nCreations and Redemptions of Shares\nThe Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 100,000 Shares). The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to certain authorized participants (Authorized Participants) on an ongoing basis. The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the combined net asset value of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.\nF-\nAs the Shares of the Trust are redeemable in Baskets at the option of the Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the Shares as Net Assets for financial reporting purposes. Activity in the number and value of Shares created and redeemed for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\n(Amounts are in 000s)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nSep-30, 2021\nActivity in Number of Shares Created and Redeemed:\nCreations\n65,000 97,800 67,500\nRedemptions\n(86,600 ) (113,800 ) (161,600 )\nNet Change in Number of Shares Created and Redeemed\n(21,600 ) (16,000 ) (94,100 )\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\n(Amounts in 000s of US$)\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nSep-30, 2021\nActivity in Value of Shares Created and Redeemed:\nCreations\n$ 11,487,838 $ 17,115,534 $ 11,694,069\nRedemptions\n(15,005,217 ) (19,135,818 ) (27,444,877 )\nNet change in Value of Shares Created and Redeemed\n$ (3,517,379 ) $ (2,020,284 ) $ (15,750,808 )\n2.7.\nIncome and Expense (Amounts in 000s of US$)\nThe Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trusts gold as necessary to pay the Trusts expenses. When selling gold to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trusts holdings of assets other than gold. Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will sell gold to the Custodians at the next LBMA Gold Price PM following the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost of the gold sold, and such amounts are reported as net realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay expenses on the Statements of Operations.\nThe Trusts net realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2023 of $5,769,797 is made up of a realized gain of $26,600 from the sale of gold to pay expenses, a realized gain of $1,717,329 from gold distributed for the redemption of Shares, and a change in unrealized gain/(loss) of $4,025,868 on investment in gold.\nThe Trusts net realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold for the year ended September 30, 2022 of $(2,706,033) is made up of a realized gain of $30,323 from the sale of gold to pay expenses, a realized gain of $2,091,493 from gold distributed for the redemption of Shares, and a change in unrealized gain/(loss)\nof $(4,827,849) on investment in gold.\n2.8.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Trust is classified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trusts income and expenses will flow through to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trusts proceeds, income, deductions, gains, and losses to the Internal Revenue Service on that basis. The Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of September 30, 2023 or 2022.\nThe Sponsor evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of its tax treatment, and its tax reporting to its shareholders, of these positions to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet that threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority. As of September 30, 2023, the 2022, 2021, and 2020 tax years remain open for examination. There were no examinations in progress at period end.\nF-\n3.\nQuarterly Statements of Operations\nYear Ended September 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended (unaudited)\nYear Ended\n(Amounts in 000s of US$, except per share data)\nDec 31, 2022\nMar 31, 2023\nJun 30, 2023\nSep 30, 2023\nSep 30, 2023\nEXPENSES\nSponsor fees\n$ 51,496 $ 54,875 $ 59,093 $ 56,145 $ 221,609\nTotal expenses\n51,496 54,875 59,093 56,145 221,609\nNet investment loss\n(51,496 ) (54,875 ) (59,093 ) (56,145 ) (221,609 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\nNet realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay expenses\n2,693 6,534 9,804 7,569 26,600\nNet realized gain/(loss) from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n175,717 312,163 674,988 554,461 1,717,329\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n3,903,862 4,559,082 (2,708,536 ) (1,728,540 ) 4,025,868\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n4,082,272 4,877,779 (2,023,744 ) (1,166,510 ) 5,769,797\nNet income/(loss)\n$ 4,030,776 $ 4,822,904 $ (2,082,837 ) $ (1,222,655 ) $ 5,548,188\nNet income/(loss) per share\n$ 12.70 $ 15.21 $ (6.46 ) $ (3.93 ) $ 17.50\nWeighted average number of shares (in 000s)\n317,265 317,031 322,625 310,962 316,955\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nThree Months Ended (unaudited)\nYear Ended\n(Amounts in 000s of US$, except per share data)\nDec 31, 2021\nMar 31, 2022\nJun 30, 2022\nSep 30, 2022\nSep 30, 2022\nEXPENSES\nSponsor fees\n$ 57,105 $ 61,058 $ 64,772 $ 55,562 $ 238,497\nTotal expenses\n57,105 61,058 64,772 55,562 238,497\nNet investment loss\n(57,105 ) (61,058 ) (64,772 ) (55,562 ) (238,497 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\nNet realized gain/(loss) from investment in gold sold to pay expenses\n7,317 8,878 9,851 4,277 30,323\nNet realized gain/(loss) from gold distributed for the redemption of shares\n302,742 440,331 924,875 423,545 2,091,493\nNet change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n2,093,694 3,535,070 (5,329,581 ) (5,127,032 ) (4,827,849 )\nNet realized and change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investment in gold\n2,403,753 3,984,279 (4,394,855 ) (4,699,210 ) (2,706,033 )\nNet income/(loss)\n$ 2,346,648 $ 3,923,221 $ (4,459,627 ) $ (4,754,772 ) $ (2,944,530 )\nNet income/(loss) per share\n$ 6.95 $ 11.09 $ (12.01 ) $ (13.93 ) $ (8.39 )\nWeighted average number of shares (in 000s)\n337,516 353,898 371,198 341,353 350,920\nF-\n4.\nRelated Parties - Sponsor and Trustee\nThe Trusts only recurring fixed expense is the Sponsors fee which accrues daily at an annual rate equal to 0.40% of the daily NAV, in exchange for the Sponsor assuming the responsibility to pay all ordinary fees and expenses of the Trust which include fees and expenses of the Trustee, fees and expenses of the Custodians for the custody of the Trusts gold bars, fees and expenses of the Sponsor, certain taxes, fees of the Marketing Agent, printing and mailing costs, legal and audit fees, registration fees, NYSE Arca listing fees and other marketing costs and expenses. Additionally, under a separate agreement with JPMorgan, the Sponsor has agreed to pay or reimburse JPMorgan for any value added, sales or similar tax chargeable on the services provided by JPMorgan as a Custodian, including any such taxes otherwise payable by the Trust.\nAffiliates of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.\n5.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Trusts sole business activity is the investment of gold. Various factors could affect the price of gold including: (i) global supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as golds uses in jewelry, technology and industrial applications, purchases made by investors in the form of bars, coins and other gold products, forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries such as China, Australia, and the United States; (ii) investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; (vi) other economic variables such as income growth, economic output, and monetary policies; and (vii) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations, especially those that are unexpected in nature. In addition, while gold is used to preserve wealth by investors around the world, there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on the Trusts financial position and results of operations.\n6.\nIndemnification\nThe Sponsor, and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, affiliates and subsidiaries, are indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against certain losses, liabilities or expenses incurred in the performance of their duties under the Trust Indenture without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance or reckless disregard of the indemnified partys obligations and duties under the Trust Indenture. Such indemnity includes payment by the Trust of the costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim or liability under the Trust Indenture. Under the Trust Indenture, the Sponsor may be able to seek indemnification by the Trust for payments it makes in connection with the Sponsors activities under the Trust Indenture to the extent its conduct does not disqualify it from receiving such indemnification under the terms of the Trust Indenture. The Sponsor is also indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense arising under the Amended and Restated Marketing Agent Agreement between the Sponsor and the Marketing Agent effective July 17, 2015, as amended, or any agreement entered into with an Authorized Participant which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of gold and any cash required for creations and redemptions insofar as such loss, liability or expense arises from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any written statement provided to the Sponsor by the Trustee. Any amounts payable to the Sponsor are secured by a lien on the Trusts assets.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to indemnify certain parties against certain liabilities and to contribute to payments that such parties may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Trustee has agreed to reimburse such parties, solely from and to the extent of the Trusts assets, for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the Sponsor in respect of such liabilities to the extent the Sponsor has not paid such amounts when due. The Sponsor has agreed that, to the extent the Trustee pays any amount in respect of the reimbursement obligations described in the preceding sentence, the Trustee, for the benefit of the Trust, will be subrogated to and will succeed to the rights of the party so reimbursed against the Sponsor.\nF-\n7.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe Trust is presenting the following financial highlights related to investment performance and operations of a Share outstanding for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total return at net asset value is based on the change in net asset value of a Share during the period and the total return at market value is based on the change in market value of a Share on the NYSE Arca during the period. An individual investors return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions.\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSep-30, 2023\nSep-30, 2022\nSep-30, 2021\nNet Asset Value\nNet asset value per Share, beginning of period\n$ 155.69 $ 162.96 $ 177.15\nNet investment income/(loss)\n(0.70 ) (0.68 ) (0.68 )\nNet Realized and Change in Unrealized Gain/(Loss)\n18.52 (6.59 ) (13.51 )\nNet Income/(Loss)\n17.82 (7.27 ) (14.19 )\nNet asset value per Share, end of period\n$ 173.51 $ 155.69 $ 162.96\nMarket value per Share, beginning of period\n$ 154.67 $ 164.22 $ 177.12\nMarket value per Share, end of period\n$ 171.45 $ 154.67 $ 164.22\nRatio to average net assets\nNet investment loss\n(0.40 )% (0.40 )% (0.40 )%\nGross expenses\n0.40 % 0.40 % 0.40 %\nNet expenses\n0.40 % 0.40 % 0.40 %\nTotal Return, at net asset value\n11.45 % (4.46 )% (8.01 )%\nTotal Return, at market value\n10.85 % (5.82 )% (7.28 )%"
