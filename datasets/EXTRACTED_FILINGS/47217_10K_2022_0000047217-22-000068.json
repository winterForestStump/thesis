    "content": "ITEM 1. Business.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions and services. We sell to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.\nOn November 1, 2015, we completed the separation (the Separation) of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Hewlett Packard Enterprise), Hewlett-Packard Companys former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses.\nHP Products and Services; Segment Information\nWe have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments. The Personal Systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook personal computers (PCs), workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail point-of-sale (POS) systems, displays and peripherals, software, support and services. The Printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, services and solutions. Corporate Investments includes HP Labs and certain business incubation and investment projects.\nPersonal Systems\nPersonal Systems offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook PCs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail POS systems, displays and peripherals, software, support and services. We group commercial notebooks, commercial desktops, commercial services, commercial mobility devices, commercial detachables and convertibles, workstations, retail POS systems and thin clients into commercial PCs and consumer notebooks, consumer desktops, consumer services and consumer detachables into consumer PCs when describing performance in these markets. Both commercial and consumer PCs maintain multi-operating system, multi-architecture strategies using Microsoft Windows and Google Chrome operating systems, and predominantly use processors from Intel Corporation (Intel) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD).\nCommercial PCs are optimized for use by enterprise, public sector (which includes education), and SMBs customers, with a focus on robust design, security, serviceability, connectivity, reliability and manageability in the customers environment and working remotely. Commercial PCs include HP ProBook and HP EliteBook lines of notebooks, convertibles, and detachables, HP Pro and HP Elite lines of business desktops and all-in-ones, retail POS systems, HP Thin Clients, HP Pro Tablet PCs and the HP notebook, desktop and Chromebook systems. Commercial PCs also include workstations that are designed and optimized for high-performance and demanding application environments including Z desktop workstations, Z all-in-ones and Z mobile workstations. Additionally, we offer a range of services and solutions to enterprise, public sector (which includes education), and SMBs customers to help them manage the lifecycle of their PC and mobility installed base.\nConsumer PCs are optimized for consumer usage, focusing on gaming, learning and working remotely, consuming multi-media for entertainment, managing personal life activities, staying connected, sharing information, getting things done for work including creating content, and staying informed and secure. These systems include HP Spectre, HP Envy, HP Pavilion, HP Chromebook, HP Stream, Omen by HP lines of notebooks, desktops and hybrids, HP Envy, HP Pavilion desktops and all-in-one lines.\nPersonal Systems groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:\nNotebooks consists of consumer notebooks, commercial notebooks, mobile workstations, peripherals, and commercial mobility devices;\nDesktops includes consumer desktops, commercial desktops, thin clients, displays, peripherals, and retail POS systems;\nWorkstations consists of desktop workstations, displays and peripherals; and\nOther consists of consumer and commercial services, Poly products and services as well as other Personal Systems capabilities.\nPrinting\nPrinting provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, services and solutions. Printing is also focused on Graphics and 3D imaging solutions in the commercial and industrial markets. Our global business capabilities within Printing are described below:\nOffice Printing Solutions delivers HPs office printers, supplies, services, and solutions to SMBs and large enterprises. It also includes Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) hardware and solutions, and some Samsung-branded supplies.\nHome Printing Solutions delivers innovative printing products, supplies, services and solutions for the home, home business and micro business customers utilizing both HPs Ink and Laser technologies. It also includes some Samsung-branded supplies.\nGraphics Solutions delivers large-format, commercial and industrial solutions and supplies to print service providers and packaging converters through a wide portfolio of printers and presses (HP DesignJet, HP Latex, HP Indigo and HP PageWide Web Presses).\n3D Printing and Digital Manufacturing offers a portfolio of additive manufacturing solutions and supplies to help customers succeed in their additive and digital manufacturing journey. HP offers complete solutions in collaboration with an ecosystem of partners.\nPrinting groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:\nCommercial consists of office printing solutions, graphics solutions and 3D printing and digital manufacturing, excluding supplies;\nConsumer consists of home printing solutions, excluding supplies; and\nSupplies comprises a set of highly innovative consumable products, ranging from ink and laser cartridges to media, graphics supplies and 3D printing and digital manufacturing supplies, for recurring use in consumer and commercial hardware.\nCorporate Investments\nCorporate Investments includes HP Labs and certain business incubation and investment projects.\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\nWe manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by consumer and commercial groups, and purchases of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a variety of partners, utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two, including:\nretailers that sell our products to the public focusing on consumers and SMBs;\nresellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;\ndistribution partners that supply our products and solutions to resellers; and\nsystem integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services, including systems integration work and as-a-service solutions, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services.\nThe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market. We believe that customer buying patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market and sub-geographic specificities for each of our businesses. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market. Our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers. For other customers and for consumers, we typically manage both direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and SMBs and commercial resellers mainly targeting SMBs and mid-market accounts. See Risk Factors- If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nManufacturing and Materials\nWe utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers (OMs) around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of OMs is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for HP-designed products. We use multiple OMs to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. In some circumstances, third-party suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the HP brand. Additionally, we manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.\nWe utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customers hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.\nWe purchase materials, supplies and product sub-assemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing or readily available alternate sources of supply. However, we have relied on sole sources for some laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies, certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations, mitigating the effect of a disruption). For instance, we source the majority of our A4 and a portion of A3 portfolio laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from Canon. Any decision by either\nparty not to renew our agreement with Canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from LaserJet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with Canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement.\nWe are dependent upon Intel and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors and Microsoft and Google for various software products. We believe that disruptions with these suppliers would have industry-wide ramifications, and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See Risk Factors-We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our financial results in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on our reliance on single-source suppliers.\nLike other participants in the information technology (IT) industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources. We also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supplies. See Risk Factors-We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our financial results in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products. We strive to make our products and packaging in an ethical and sustainable manner. We have committed to building an efficient, resilient and sustainable supplier network, and we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions, and to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. These actions, together with our broader sustainability program, help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements and comply with regulations, such as supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures. For more information on our sustainability goals, programs, and performance, we refer you to our annual Sustainable Impact Report, available on our website (which is not incorporated by reference herein).\nInternational\nOur products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise customers demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce. This provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. We believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus on diversity and inclusion, gives us a solid base on which to build future growth. See \"Risk Factors-Due to the international nature of our business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance\" and \"We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results\" in Item 1A, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nResearch and Development\nInnovation across products, services, business models and processes is a key element of our culture and success. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers changing needs and desires, and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers experiences.\nHP Labs, together with the various research and development groups within our business segments, is responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part of our Corporate Investments segment.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see Risk Factors-If we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nPatents\nOur general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2022, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 28,000 patents, including patents acquired as a result of our acquisition of Plantronics, Inc. (Poly) in August 2022.\nPatents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is essential to HP as a whole or to any of HPs business segments.\nIn addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property (IP) from third parties. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses, and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to IP rights, see Risk Factors-Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop, obtain, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend and Risk Factors-Third-party claims of IP infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSeasonality\nGeneral economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of macroeconomic challenges and different demand dynamics. See Risk Factors-Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable, in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCompetition\nWe encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service, support and solutions including subscription-based offerings and financing, security, availability of application software, and our sustainability performance.\nThe markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.\nWe have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing-related products and services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments.\nThe competitive environment in which each key segment operates is described below:\nPersonal Systems. The markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and introduction of new products and solutions. Our primary competitors are Lenovo Group Limited, Dell Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Acer Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. In particular geographies, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or white box manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, our innovative design work, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.\nPrinting. The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printings key customer segments each face competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Canon Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation Ltd., Seiko Epson Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd. and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer non-original supplies (including imitation, refill and remanufactured alternatives), which are often available for lower prices but which can also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to HP original inkjet and toner supplies. These and other competing products are often sold alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers or distributors, or such resellers and distributors may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. Our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high-quality solutions for the home, office and publishing environments, our innovation, and research and development capabilities including security features, sustainability, our brand, and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see Risk Factors-We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance, in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSustainability\nAt HP, we believe how we do things is just as important as what we do. Our Sustainable Impact goals reflect our efforts to tackle key issues in Climate, Human Rights, and Digital Equity as follows:\nClimate Action: Drive toward a net zero carbon, fully regenerative economy while engineering the industrys most sustainable portfolio of products and solutions. Among our goals:\nAchieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across HPs value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040, with a 50% reduction in absolute value chain GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2019;\nReach 75% circularity for products and packaging by 2030;\nMaintain zero deforestation for HP paper and paper-based packaging and counteract deforestation for non-HP paper used in our products and print services;\nHuman Rights: Create a powerful culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.\nMany of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. Most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, and their safe use.\nWe proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment.\nWe are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as product take-back legislation). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. We intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled, and we provide many of our customers with reuse and recycling programs.\nIn the event our products become non-compliant with these laws or standards, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines.\nOur operations, supply chain and our products are currently, and expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, requiring us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines. We strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations, supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more cost-effective and lower carbon technology solutions to our customers. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that HP technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties.\nWe are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. This commitment is reflected and outlined in our sustainability policy, our comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.\nA liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors, see Risk Factors-Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, for a discussion of our environmental contingencies see Note 14, Litigation and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is also incorporated herein by reference.\nHuman Capital\nApproximately 58,000 employees worldwide (including employees from the recent Poly acquisition), power HPs innovation, contributing unique perspectives and a growth mindset to create breakthrough technologies and transformative solutions. We are committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace that attracts, retains, and advances exceptional talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety, and employee well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work-while learning, growing, and feeling engaged. Because we are in the process of integrating Poly, the following metrics do not include Poly employees.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nInnovation at HP comes from the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, knowledge, and unique experiences of our employees. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people bring their authentic selves to work and can reach their full potential.\nOur commitment to DEI starts at the top with a highly knowledgeable, skilled and diverse board of directors. We are among the top technology companies for women in executive positions. Women represent 33.3% of HPs full-time executive positions globally. We are committed to improving representation of women at HP overall, with an intentional focus on leadership and technical roles globally.\nIn fiscal year 2022, 46.4% of our U.S. hires were ethnically diverse. We continue to work on removing barriers for underrepresented employees by creating equitable programs, training and development opportunities to grow and promote our employees.\nTo ensure senior executive leadership embeds a strong focus on DEI, the CEO and his direct reports have individual performance goals tied to DEI under the Management by Objectives (MBOs) program. The board has ongoing oversight of this program, which impacts executive compensation.\nPay Equity\nWe believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other protected characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on relevant market data and consider factors such as an employees role and experience, and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to make sure our pay is fair and equitable.\nFor the past six years, HP has reviewed employees compensation with the support of independent third-party experts to ensure consistent pay practices.\nHP expanded its annual pay equity assessment in fiscal year 2022 and evaluated 16 countries with our largest employee populations, representing approximately 85% of our global workforce. The independent analysis did not reveal any systemic issues. Any areas of potential concern, considering what we would expect employees to be paid when evaluating their skills, qualifications, and experience, were reviewed and addressed as part of our off-cycle compensation process.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe regularly collect feedback from employees to better understand and improve their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. In fiscal year 2022, 93% of employees participated in our annual employee engagement survey. Employee engagement improved globally as compared to fiscal year 2021. Employees ranked HP highly on ethics and integrity, with 93% responding favorably. Employees also rated HP highly in terms of valuing diversity, at 95%. Our Inclusion Index reported 89% of employees experience an inclusive work environment at HP, an increase from last year.\nTalent and Learning\nOur employees talent, diversity, and drive fuels HP. We provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, mentoring, and coaching. Through collaborative learning experiences, employees build networks with subject matter experts and use social learning tools to integrate development into daily routines and drive personal career growth.\nIn fiscal year 2022, 99% of employees participated in learning and development and we estimate that employees on average spent approximately 30 hours engaged in such activities over the course of the year. The 2022 annual employee engagement survey revealed that 85% of employees felt HP actively supported their learning and development, with 81% believing that they have what is needed to build new skills and/or stretch beyond current capabilities.\nFocus areas for learning and development this year included upskilling technical skills across the organization through a series of development opportunities focused on technical, digital, automation, service, and software skills. We also prioritized leadership development, including a new development program focused on increasing agility, expanded use of performance coaching, and a one-year journey for new managers to prepare them for their leadership career. We continued to develop the future leadership pipeline by investing in emerging and underrepresented talent through formal programs, mentoring, and sponsorship. Our programs focus on team development, the future of work, new business models, and opportunities to deepen inclusion and growth mindset practices.\nTo reinforce development for all employees, a key focus in fiscal year 2022 was the utilization of the Talent Development Planning tool which was launched mid fiscal year 2021 and was used by 86% of managers to create personalized talent development plans for team members with the goal of accelerating talent development and deepening the readiness of team members for additional opportunities.\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nThe physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance, and mental health of our employees are vital to HPs success. Our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess worldwide and regional trends as a part of quarterly reviews. Our manufacturing facilities continue to represent our most significant health and safety risks, due to higher potential exposure to chemicals and machinery-related hazards. Reducing and effectively managing risks at these facilities remains a focus, and injury rates continue to be low.\nWe also sponsor a global wellness program designed to enhance wellbeing for all HP employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors across our five pillars of wellness - physical, financial, emotional, life balance, and social/community-through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. In addition to our regular annual wellbeing programs, we provide specialized programs and campaigns in line with employee needs at the time. This year we implemented the 90 Days to a Better You campaign where we introduced new opportunities for employees to prioritize themselves and their own wellbeing, granting access to mindfulness apps, targeted mental health support and opportunities to take individual wellbeing assessments.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, one of HPs top priorities has been the health, safety, and wellbeing of employees and their families. We've put in place global policies and protocols based on guidance from healthcare experts and public health leaders, and regularly review and update them to reflect the best, most current information available.\nHybrid Work Strategy\nWe continue to embrace hybrid ways of working across HP in accordance with our flexible working guidelines adopted in July 2021. Hybrid Work at HP balances more workplace flexibility with structured time together to collaborate and connect in person at our HP sites. Our goal is to provide the ability to work seamlessly across a diverse ecosystem of workplaces, enabled by enhanced tools and technology designed to optimize productivity and collaboration.\nOverall, we aim to cultivate a healthy, supportive, and inclusive environment that enables employees to do their best work, while developing themselves and reaching their full potential.\nSee \u2018Our employees section of our 2021 Sustainable Impact Report for more detailed information about our Human Capital programs (which is not incorporated by reference herein).\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following are our current executive officers:\nAlex Cho; age 50; President, Personal Systems\nMr. Cho has served as President, Personal Systems since June 2018.

Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be particularly read in conjunction with Part I, Item I, Business and Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nThe risks we describe in this Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could, in ways we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and they could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate.\nMACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL RISKS\nGlobal, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our demand for our products and services and our business and financial performance.\nOur business and financial performance depends on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for our products and services in the markets in which we compete. Ongoing economic weakness, including an economic slowdown or recession, uncertainty in markets throughout the world and other adverse economic conditions, including inflation, changes in monetary policy and increased interest rates, have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased demand for our products and services and increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels and accurately forecasting revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses. For example, in part due to ongoing economic uncertainty, we observed a decline in consumer demand beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, particularly with respect to Consumer PCs. Ongoing U.S. federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products and services.\nProlonged or more severe economic weakness and uncertainty could also cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice. Poor financial performance of asset markets and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses.\nDue to the international nature of our business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.\nMore than 65% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2022 came from outside the United States. In addition, a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\nongoing instability or changes in a countrys or regions economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy, actual or anticipated military or political conflicts (including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its regional and global ramifications and tensions across the Taiwan Strait), health emergencies or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or Brexit and its impact;\nthe imposition by governments of additional taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the United States and other countries, including China and Russia;\ntrade (including trade embargoes) and other policies, laws and regulations affecting production, shipping, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by the United States or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors or other country localization requirements;\npolitical or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade, including the willingness of non-U.S. consumers to purchase goods or services from U.S. corporations;\nmanaging a geographically dispersed workforce and local labor conditions and regulations, including labor issues faced by specific suppliers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), or changes to immigration and labor law which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent;\nchanges or uncertainty in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments, including tax laws and antitrust laws;\ndiffering technology standards, customer requirements or levels of protection of intellectual property;\nimport, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws, and adverse consequences, such as fines or other penalties, for any failure to comply, including compliance by Poly or other acquired companies, which may have less robust internal compliance procedures; and\nfluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points for our products and shipments.\nThe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States and our supply chain. For example, we rely on manufacturers in Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture. In addition, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including any escalation or expansion) and the ancillary geopolitical, economic, and other effects of that invasion can also heighten the other risks identified in this report.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition have been, and could continue to be, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. While COVID-19 positively impacted demand for some of our products and services, these trends and consumer behavior have started to change as a result of macroeconomic factors, and we are not experiencing a continuation of such increased demand. In addition, consumer behavior and the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain.\nCOVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. Our manufacturing sites, as well as those of our channel partners, suppliers and outsourcing partners, and our supply chain have been adversely and may continue to be adversely impacted as a result of restrictions and logistics and operational challenges related to COVID-19, including zero-COVID policies and lockdowns in China or elsewhere. These disruptions have resulted and may continue to result in supply shortages and delays impacting sales worldwide for both Personal Systems and Print, as well as incremental costs. We may experience further disruptions to our manufacturing operations, supply chain and/or distribution channels in the future, and these disruptions may be prolonged.\nCOVID-19 may also affect our business and financial results in ways that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider as significant. The ultimate impact depends on many factors that are not within our control, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including closures, quarantines, and similar actions); general economic uncertainty in global markets and financial market volatility; and global economic conditions and levels of economic growth.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results.\nCurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen, can have an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Global events, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainty, may cause currencies to fluctuate, which may contribute to variations in sales of our products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Because a majority of our revenues are generated outside the United States, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our net revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States, as well as our ability to implement price increases. From time to time, we may use derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign\ncurrency exchange rate risks. Our hedging strategies may be ineffective, may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations, or may result in losses.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, manufacturing equipment failures, cybersecurity attacks, data breaches, power or water shortages, natural disasters, fires, extreme weather conditions (whether as a result of climate change or otherwise) such as those described in Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business below, medical epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars, for which we are predominantly uninsured, may also disrupt our worldwide operations. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and/or result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. Our operations and those of our significant suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations in key locations, including logistics hubs in Asia, are disrupted for any reason, such as those described above or other economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political reasons. In addition, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their orders, or these events could otherwise result in a decrease in demand for our products.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nThere are inherent climate-related risks wherever our business is conducted. Global climate change is resulting, and is projected to continue to result, in certain natural disasters and adverse weather, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, flooding, heat waves, and cold waves, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity. Such extreme events are driving changes in market dynamics, stakeholder expectations, local, national and international climate change policies and regulations could result in disruptions to us, our suppliers, vendors, customers and logistics hubs and impact employees abilities to commute or to work from home effectively. These disruptions could make it more difficult and costly for us to deliver our products and services, obtain components or other supplies through our supply chain, maintain or resume operations or perform other critical corporate functions, and could reduce customer demand for our products and services.\nThe increasing concern over climate change could also result in transition risks such as shifting customer preferences and regulations. Changing customer preferences may result in increased demands regarding our solutions, products, and services, including the use of packaging materials and other components in our products and their environmental impact. These demands may cause us to incur additional costs or make other changes to other operations to respond to such demands, which could adversely affect our financial results. If we fail to manage transition risks, including such demands, in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, and our profitability could suffer. Concerns over climate change, as well as the adoption of new laws or regulations, may also impact market dynamics and may result in shifts in customer expectations, preferences or requirements, which may require us to change our practices or incur increased costs or adversely impact customer demand for our products and services. Additionally, concerns over climate change have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, the adoption of legal and regulatory requirements designed to address climate change, as well as legal and regulatory requirements requiring certain climate-related disclosures. Where new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations. Ultimately, the impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as disruptions resulting from climate-related events or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory changes, changes in market dynamics or increased operating costs, including the cost of insurance) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFailure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nOur credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. A downgrade of our current credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, reduce access to capital markets and/or market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. We cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nOur debt obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition to our current total debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions or for other general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control, and could be adversely impacted by our debt level. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Additionally, further indebtedness may increase the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing.\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividends are affected by a number of factors and may fluctuate.\nAlthough historically we have announced regular cash dividend payments and we have adopted a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to pay cash dividends or to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all. The declaration and payment of any future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors. The level of dividends and amount, timing, and purchases under our share repurchase program, if any, are influenced by many factors and may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash and because of changes in tax laws, and the market price of our common stock. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report. For example, we make significant estimates and assumptions when accounting for revenue recognition, taxes on earnings and restructuring and other charges, and when including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. We also estimate sales and marketing program incentives based on a number of factors including historical experience, expected customer behavior and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSTRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and supply chain issues have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our financial results.\nWe have been operating in a supply-constrained environment and are facing, and may continue to face, component shortages, logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows. We are heavily dependent on third-party suppliers and their ability to deliver sufficient quantities of key components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet schedules for the delivery of our products and services. In addition, our operations depend on our ability to anticipate and our suppliers ability to fulfill, our needs for sufficient quantities of key components, products and services (including sourcing matched sets). Given the wide variety of products and services we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems have and could continue to arise in production, planning and inventory management, and regulatory compliance that could seriously harm our business. Third-party suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions, particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility, and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations. Due to the international nature of our third-party supplier network, our financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers, increased tariffs and localization requirements, which could increase the cost or availability of certain components, products and services that we may not be able to offset.\nWe also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers. Our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers-and our suppliers from their\nsuppliers-due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit, or if any of our distributors lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain for cost or redundancy could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers and Outsourced Manufacturers (OMs) may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us, which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs, jeopardizing our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations, which could in turn, result in a decrease in sales, profitability and cash flows, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.\nOther supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, risks related to supply chain working conditions, human rights and materials sourcing, and risks related to our relationships with single-source suppliers, each of which is described below.\nComponent shortages. We have and may continue to experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the inability of suppliers to borrow funds, disputes with suppliers (some of whom are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems we face during the transition to new suppliers. For example, a market shortage of integrated circuits and panels and other component supply has affected, and may affect in the future, lead times, the cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. Additionally, our Personal Systems business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture our products and we are therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to manufacture our products to fulfill demand. We represent a substantial portion of the business for certain OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular OM could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving component products from that OM. If shortages or delays in component products persist, the price of certain components may increase further, we may be exposed to quality issues, or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, we may lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers due to such component shortages or delays. If we cannot adequately address a component supply issue, we may have to re-engineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.\nExcess supply. In order to secure components for our products or services, we have and may continue to make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components.\nContractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and may be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same OMs and suppliers that we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our Personal Systems business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to OMs may create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of the OMs, may create collectability risks. In addition, in order to secure components, we may accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us.\nContingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to effectively manage this workforce could adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to manage the costs associated with engaging a contingent workforce may be impacted by evolving local labor rights laws.\nWorking conditions, human rights and materials sourcing. Our brand perception, customer loyalty and legal compliance could be adversely impacted by a suppliers improper practices or failure to comply with our requirements for environmentally, socially or legally responsible practices and sourcing.\nSingle-source suppliers. We obtain a significant number of components from a single source due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. For example, we rely on Canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges and certain key suppliers for application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). We also rely on both Intel and AMD to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for the majority of our PCs and workstations. Some of those processors may be customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained initially from only one source until we have determined whether there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations. For some components, alternative sources may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In certain circumstances, we purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms, but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. The loss of, deterioration of our relationship with, or limits in allocation by, a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nIf we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nOur strategy is to strengthen our core businesses, innovate and develop new products, services and solutions, expand into adjacencies, and grow organically and inorganically. To execute our strategy, we must, among other things, optimize our cost structure, make long-term investments, develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property, commit significant research and development and other resources, evolve our go-to-market strategy and business model to meet changing market dynamics, forces and demand. In addition, we need to innovate, develop and execute on evolutionary strategies in a rapidly changing and increasingly hybrid environment, seize on disruptive opportunities and effectively respond to secular trends and shifts in customer preferences. Our financial performance will depend in part on our ability to remain competitive in offerings geared towards hybrid consumption. For example, we believe we and others in our industry face long-term challenges related to, among other things, decreased demand for printing products and solutions as a result of increased digitization and hybrid work, and increasing competition from generic alternatives. We may be unable to successfully execute our strategy, sufficiently invest in, prioritize research and development, or market and scale strategic growth areas, accurately predict technological or business trends or control costs. Moreover, the process of developing new high-technology products, services and solutions and enhancing existing products, services and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to customers changing needs (or the timing of those needs) or accurately identify emerging technological trends. In addition, our ability to successfully offer our products, services and solutions in this rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively calibrate and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. In addition, we may be unable to appropriately prioritize and balance our initiatives or effectively manage change throughout our organization.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation, technological change and customer preferences. Even if we successfully develop new products and technologies, future products and technologies, including those created by our competitors, may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences and timely enhancement of our existing products and technologies or develop new ones. As a result, we could fail to maintain market leadership in certain of our products, such as commercial PCs and notebooks, and any of our products and technologies may be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.\nAfter we develop a product, we must be able to quickly manufacture appropriate volumes while also managing costs and preserving or improving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed in doing so within a given products lifecycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, the operating margins may not be as high as the historical or anticipated margins.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.\nWe encounter aggressive competition from competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software and internet infrastructure\nofferings, and our sustainability performance. We have faced, and may continue to face, declines in market share for our products, including in Personal Systems. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully, our results of operations, cash flows and business prospects could be affected.\nWe have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines. Because of the size and scope of our portfolio, we may invest a greater percentage of our revenues, including on research and development, than some of our competitors. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available for their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services or greater economies of scale, which could in turn result in our inability to maintain market leadership in certain of our products, such as commercial PCs and notebooks. In addition, if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur alliance partners in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in others. In addition, these partners also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us.\nWe have faced and expect to continue to face aggressive price competition and have lowered and may in the future need to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our market share, revenue and gross margin. Competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and/or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, have been able to offer and may continue to be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Price competition often increases during periods of lower demand, including as a result of declining macroeconomic conditions. The sales prices for our products may also decline as a result of discounts, a change in or mix of products and services, anticipation of the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors, promotional programs, product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors. We may also provide pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which the sales occur.\nIndustry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Our competitors may also affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers. Furthermore, non-original supplies (including imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives), which are often available at lower prices, compete with our Printing Supplies business and we may not be able to prevent the use of imitation print supplies with our printers using technological protection measures. In addition, online and omnichannel retailers, resellers and distributors often sell our products alongside competing products, including non-original supplies, or they may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. We expect this competition will continue.\nIf we cannot continue to produce high-quality and secure products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance may suffer.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services, including potential flaws in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by third-parties. Many of our products are dependent on third-party software, including from Microsoft and Google, to function as intended, and product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. Our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in third-party components or materials included in our products, including security vulnerabilities. The products and services that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors, particularly with respect to undiscovered defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties.\nIf we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality or security issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments. We have and may again in the future write off some or all of the value of non-performing inventory. In addition, after products are delivered, quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing these issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs. In the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with third-party components, we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation, which may be ineffective. Quality and security issues, including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in third-party components, can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nOur operating results have historically varied and may not be indicative of future results.\nOur net revenue, gross margin, profit and cash flow generation vary among our portfolio of products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely vary in future periods. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that periods net revenue, which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services. We have experienced and may continue to experience delays or reductions in spending by our customers or potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and could result in a significant decline in net revenue. In addition, net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses, as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Moreover, newer geographic markets can be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, increased tariffs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period. These factors could also make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to suppliers and manufacturers, manage our relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing our global, multi-tier distribution network including the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins and we may fail to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services.\nConflicts might arise between our various distribution channels, we may experience the loss or deterioration of an alliance or distribution arrangement or a reduced assortments of our products, we may not able to limit the potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners and we may fail to optimize the use of our pricing programs. Moreover, some of our channel partners and distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. They may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Net revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace.\nOur inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing (and factoring in supply chain challenges and order cancellations). Our forecasts may not accurately predict demand, and distributors have and may continue to increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods, including a multi-tiered channel, may reduce our visibility into inventories, demand and pricing trends, and may therefore make forecasting and managing multi-tiered channel inventory more difficult.\nIf we were to expand direct distribution initiatives, channel and indirect distributors could consider such initiatives in conflict with their business interests and reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of our products, or cease all sales of our products. Sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products has and could continue to make our forecasting and channel inventory management more difficult and impact pricing in the market. For example, in the past we have had channel partners sell products outside of their agreed territory, and misrepresent sales to unauthorized resellers as sales to end-users, frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory or maintain consistent pricing, and negatively impacting gross margins. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. In addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting among the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to achieve\nglobal consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing. In addition, our global channel partners may fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.\nOur quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarters total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, supply disruptions, logistics challenges or declines in demand could adversely impact our inventory levels, our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.\nWe experience seasonal trends in the sale of our products that may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments (particularly, sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter. Consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter due in part to seasonal holiday demand, and typically it has been our strongest quarter by revenues. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer may also be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. However, historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and such patterns have been and may continue to be impacted by supply constraints, macroeconomic conditions, such as an economic slowdown or inflationary pressures, shifts in customer behavior and the evolving impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margins. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to execute acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully and we may have difficulty or fail to successfully integrate acquired companies.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses (such as our recent acquisition of Poly), divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business. Risks associated with these transactions include the following:\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of any particular transaction, in the timeframe we expected or at all, such transaction may be less profitable than anticipated or unprofitable, we may not identify all factors to estimate accurately our costs, timing or other matters, and realizing the benefits of a particular transaction may depend upon competition, market trends, additional costs or investments and the actions of advisors, suppliers or other third parties.\nCertain transactions have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to compensation and benefit costs, goodwill and impairment charges, charges from elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, advisory fees, and payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.\nOur due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the targets product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal controls, including as a result of being dependent on the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties.\nIn order to finance a transaction, we may issue common stock (potentially creating dilution) or take on additional debt.\nThese transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nAn acquisition target may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls.\nThese transactions may lead to litigation.\nIn addition, if we fail to identify, successfully complete and integrate transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units, we may incur additional charges, which may include impairment charges.\nIn the case of a divestiture, we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In\naddition, we may experience fewer benefits than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected.\nThe business combination and investment transactions in which we engage may be large or complex, and we must manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products, services or employees. Integrations involve significant challenges and are often time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. These challenges include successfully combining product and service offerings; entering or expanding into markets; retaining key employees; integrating employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; and retaining customers and distributors.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business.\nWe have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring plans in order to realign our cost structure and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, including the plan announced November 2022. Implementation of any restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business, and we may not be able to obtain the anticipated cost savings, operational improvements and estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all. Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. Restructuring can require a significant amount of time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. For more information about our restructuring plans, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nOur financial performance may suffer if we cannot develop, obtain, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property (IP) laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain IP rights in the products and services we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations. However, our IP rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such IP rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position. In addition, we may choose to not apply for patent protection or may fail to apply for patent protection in a timely fashion. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.\nIn addition, certain of our businesses and products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our IP. Third-party components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our IP without compensation or on undesirable terms. Some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our IP rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these IP rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights. Finally, we may rely on third parties to enforce certain IP rights.\nThird-party claims of IP infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.\nThird parties have in the past claimed, and may in the future claim, that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their IP rights. We have seen an increasing trend of patent assertion entities engaging in claims of infringement and assertion of patents to extract settlements. If we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed IP at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we\nbelieve that IP claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert managements attention and resources away from our business. Claims of IP infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain products. Additionally, claims of IP infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships.\nIn certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from us levies upon IT equipment (such as PCs and printers). There have also been efforts to introduce, modify or extend existing levy schemes and to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us. The total amount of the copyright levies depends on several factors, and could be substantial. The ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price.\nWe are exposed to cyberattacks from individuals and organizations, including malicious computer programmers and hackers, state-sponsored organizations, nation-states or other bad actors, seeking to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Such attacks may involve the deployment of viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities, or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, or others to disclose passwords, other sensitive information or provide access to our systems or data. Such risks extend not only to our own products, services, systems and networks, but also to those of customers, suppliers, contractors, business partners, vendors, and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects or vulnerabilities in design or manufacture, including bugs that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the product. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, harm our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our IP or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, the costs to combat cyber or other security threats can be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security, regardless of their immediacy or accuracy, could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business.\nWhile we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security threats, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches. Moreover, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby making it more difficult to successfully defend against them or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may not have the current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow those vulnerabilities to persist in our systems over long periods of time. In the past, we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to or use of our systems or those of third parties, which to date, have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impact will not be material in the future. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems has increased significantly, which also increases our cybersecurity attack surface. We have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforces. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russias invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nBecause we process proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers, breaches of our security measures or accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of such data can expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss, alteration or misuse of such information. A breach could also damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business, and could result in government enforcement actions, litigation and potential liability for us. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to data protection, particularly in the U.S., European Union, and China (such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), and governmental agencies are increasingly proposing regulatory requirements relating to data protection. These laws and regulations continue to evolve, are increasing in complexity and number and increasingly conflict\namong the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing new data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure, including those provided by third parties, may experience interruptions, outages, delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations, migration work or other causes, which could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive than planned. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes, resulting in delayed sales, lower margins, lost customers or reputational damage.\nOur business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly.\nThe success of our services business (such as our managed print services, digital services and other workforce solutions in both Printing and Personal Systems) depends to a significant degree on attracting, retaining, and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from our customers. Our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customers option and/or subject to cancellation rights, with or without penalties for early termination. We may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our customers, or our customers may reduce the scope of the services they contract for. Factors that may influence contract termination, non-renewal or reduction include business downturns, dissatisfaction with our services or products, our retirement or lack of support for our services, our customers selecting alternative technologies, the cost of our services as compared to our competitors, general market conditions, or other reasons. We may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost customers or reductions in services. While our services agreements may include penalties for early termination, these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses. Our customers could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future. In addition, the pricing and other terms of certain services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these contracts, which may increase as services become more customized, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable. As a result, we may not generate the revenues, profits or cash flows we may have anticipated from our services business within the expected timelines, if at all.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, hire, retain, train, motivate, develop, and deploy qualified executives, engineers, technical staff and other key employees. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the technology industry can be intense. Equity-based compensation is essential for attracting and retaining qualified employees and lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. In addition, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and we may not be able to manage changing workforce dynamics successfully. Moreover, changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent globally. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and we may be unable to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees or successfully execute succession plans.\nSome anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent changes of control of HP judged as undesirable by our Board of Directors. These provisions include: authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and controlling the procedures for our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings, and election, appointment and removal of our directors. These provisions could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management or limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock.\nOur aspirations and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nWe have established and publicly announced ESG goals, including our commitments to address climate change, human rights, and digital equity. These statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our failure to adequately update, accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community, special interest groups and enforcement authorities.\nOur ability to achieve any ESG objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources, the evolving regulatory requirements affecting product circularity, ESG standards or disclosures, the evolving consumer protection laws applicable to ESG matters and the availability of materials and suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other ESG goals.\nStandards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting ESG data may be updated and previously reported ESG data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting ESG matters across our operations and supply chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures that may be required by the SEC, European and other regulators, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation or our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror, service provider or employer could be negatively impacted.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted and changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or increased restrictions or prohibiting them outright. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations, and product repairability, reuse and take-back legislation. In addition, there are existing and proposed legislation related to environmental and social responsibility (including forced labor tracing requirements) for our operations, supply chain partners, and our products and services. Moreover, we are expected to become increasingly subject to laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements or more prescriptive reporting requirements.\nAs these new laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, sanctions or other penalties, including fines. Such burdens or costs may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also face significant compliance and operational burdens and incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with or rectify non-compliance with these laws or regulations. Our potential exposure also includes third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault.\nWe are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, employment, and other issues on a global basis. There is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment, including but not limited to employment and patent-monetization claims in the United States and litigation and regulatory matters focused on consumer protection, privacy, and competition regulation globally. As described in Note 14, Litigation and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, if decided adversely to or settled by us. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings have occurred and may occur, including awards of monetary damages, imposition of fines, issuance of injunctions or cease-and-desist orders directing us to cease engaging in certain business practices, cease manufacturing or selling certain products, requiring the compulsory licensing of patents, or requiring other remedies. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management.\nFailure to comply with our customer and partner contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to procurement regulations, contract provisions and other specific requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. In addition, contracts with customers may also include a requirement to comply with customer codes of conduct, which may have terms that conflict with our code of conduct, business policies and strategic objectives. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in loss of business or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business and affect our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer. Our partner contracts also contain terms relating to new partner business models and tools creation that could raise issues for which laws or regulations are currently changing or emerging. This could affect us in ways that are not currently fully known or measurable.\nChanges in our tax provisions, adverse tax audits, the adoption of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and approximately 60 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that the positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, and, we believe we have provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions, pension and related interest. We adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. Determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates, and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable. We may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows.\nOur effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement. In addition, changes in tax law and regulation in the U.S. or elsewhere could significantly impact our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. For example, the U.S. Congress has advanced a variety of tax legislation proposals, and while the final form of any legislation is uncertain, the current proposals, if enacted, could have a material effect on the Companys effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate could also be materially affected by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Developments, the European Commissions and other certain major jurisdictions heightened interest in and taxation of large multi-national companies. In addition, we continue to monitor the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business, tax rate and financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION\nWe continue to face risks related to the Separation, including failure to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the Separation and related to shared use of certain intellectual property rights.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements. The separation and distribution agreement provides for cross-indemnities between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise for liabilities allocated to the respective party pursuant to the terms of such agreement. If Hewlett Packard Enterprise or its successor entities (including spun off businesses to which obligations have been transferred) are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nIn addition, the terms of the Separation include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and we retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP\nbranding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise could also adversely affect our reputation.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services. We sell to individual consumers, SMBs and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. We have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments. The Personal Systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook PCs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail POS systems, displays and peripherals, software, support, and services. The Printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, solutions and services. Corporate Investments include HP Labs and certain business incubation and investment projects.\nIn Personal Systems, our strategic focus is on:\n\u25e6profitable growth through innovation, market segmentation and simplification of our portfolio\n\u25e6enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes;\n\u25e6investing in endpoint services and solutions. We are focused on services, including Device as a Service, as the market begins to shift to contractual solutions, and accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as peripherals; and\n\u25e6driving innovation to enable productivity and collaboration with the PC becoming essential for hybrid work, learn and play.\nWe believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup along with our recent acquisitions in peripherals and remote-computing solutions.\nIn Printing, our strategic focus is on:\n\u25e6offering innovative printing solutions and contractual solutions to serve consumers, SMBs and large enterprises through our Instant Ink Services, HP+ and Managed Print Services solutions;\n\u25e6providing digital printing solutions for graphics segments and applications including commercial publishing, labels, packaging, and textiles; and\n\u25e6expanding our footprint in 3D printing across digital manufacturing and strategic applications.\nIn addition to growing our subscription business, we are also focused on rebalancing system profitability to more upfront profitable hardware sales through our product offerings including HP+ and Big Tank.\nWe are committed to growing our peripherals, gaming, workforce solutions, consumer subscriptions, 3D and industrial graphics businesses. Our ability to innovate is helping us gain momentum in growth areas like gaming and peripherals, and we see significant opportunities to drive greater recurring revenues across Personal Systems and Printing. Our acquisition of Poly adds to our growth portfolio by bringing industry-leading video conferencing solutions, cameras, headsets, voice and software capabilities. To drive more integration across our commercial services, software and security portfolio, we have created a new Workforce Services and Solutions organization. We continue to build on strong portfolios like Instant Ink to grow our Consumer Subscription business. In Industrial Graphics, we are driving the shift from analog to digital in segments like labels and packaging. In Personalization & 3D, we are creating end-to-end solutions that can capture more value with our differentiated technology.\nWe continue to experience challenges that are representative of the trends and uncertainties that may affect our industry, generally, and our business and financial results, specifically, and we expect these challenges to continue in the short-term. One set of challenges relates to the current macroeconomic environment and the adverse impact on demand for certain of our products and product mix. A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape, with increasing online and omnichannel presence. Additional challenges we face at the segment level, and that we expect to continue facing in the short-term are set forth below.\nIn Personal Systems, we face challenges with competitive pricing environment, supply shortages in certain parts of business, elevated commodity and logistics costs compared to pre-pandemic levels. We are also experiencing softness in demand resulting in overall decline in Personal Systems market.\nIn Printing, we face challenges from a competitive environment, including non-original supplies (which includes imitation, refill, or remanufactured alternatives), and we face component constraints which we expect to continue to negatively impact our financial performance in the short term. We also obtain many Printing components from single\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nsource due to technology, availability, price, quality, or other considerations. For instance, we source the majority of our A4 and a portion of our A3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from Canon. Any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with Canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from LaserJet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with Canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement.\nTo address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes, analytics, efficiencies and simplification of our product portfolio. We also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models, aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improving channel execution and inventory, production and backlog management, strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, effective cost management, strengthening our pricing discipline, and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nOur business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. We face global macroeconomic challenges, particularly in light of the effects of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine, tensions across the Taiwan Strait, the COVID-19 pandemic, tariff-driven headwinds, uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates, inflationary trends and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment. Throughout fiscal 2022, we observed significant market uncertainty, increasing inflationary pressures, supply constraints and a strengthening U.S. dollar, as well as ongoing effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. These market dynamics, which we expect will continue in the short-term, have created new and different demand dynamics in our markets and have had significant impacts on our financial results.\nWhile our Personal Systems business benefited from the hybrid work environment and growth in gaming driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, these trends and consumer behavior have started to change as a result of various macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to inflation, foreign currency, and lower consumer spending. Beginning third quarter of fiscal 2022, we observed an accelerated decline in consumer demand, particularly with respect to Consumer PCs. This decline in demand is in line with industry-wide declines and we expect this to continue for fiscal 2023. For the fiscal year 2022, we continued to see strong demand in Windows-based Commercial PCs, and mix shifts from low end to premium products. However, we anticipate the overall macroeconomic environment to continue to adversely impact the demand for Commercial PCs in the short-term. In Printing, we continued to see gradual and uneven recovery in Commercial Print, driven by the slow return of workers to the office, and softening of demand in Consumer Print, which accelerated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Also, we experienced an increasingly competitive pricing environment in the second half of fiscal 2022, which we expect to continue in the short-term, due to the macroeconomic environment across Personal Systems and Printing. Further, our operating margins were negatively impacted by the higher cost due to inflationary pressures. In fiscal 2023, we expect decline in both Personal Systems and Printing market compared to fiscal 2022.\nSupply chain dynamics have impacted and we expect will continue to impact logistics and component costs at least in the short term, with logistics costs remaining elevated for the fiscal year as a result of both expedited shipments of components and overall rate costs in the freight network, while capacity improved in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we expect industry wide commodity and component constraints, including application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are unique to our products in Personal Systems and Printing, to continue to impact our businesses in the short-term. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and variants of the coronavirus, as well as the impact the pandemic has on our employees, customers, business partners, and communities. We have experienced and may experience future disruptions in supply, manufacturing and logistics, particularly in Asia, and with our suppliers and outsourcing partners globally as a result of COVID-19.\nIn addition to the macroeconomic dynamics, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have a large global presence, with more than 65% of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 coming from outside the United States. As a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect foreign currency fluctuations to continue to negatively impact our financial results in the fiscal 2023.\nOn May 31, 2022, we announced our decision to wind down business operations in Russia having already suspended all new shipments and paused our marketing and advertising activities in February 2022. Russia contributed approximately $1.0 billion of total net revenue in fiscal 2021. In the second half of fiscal 2022, we recognized a charge of $23 million towards severance, cancellation of contracts, inventory write-downs and other one-time exit charges related to our decision. A significant escalation or expansion of the situations current scope could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We continue to be focused on the safety and security of our employees and their families in the impacted regions and we have provided, and expect to continue to provide grants to support Ukrainian relief efforts.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due, in part, to seasonal holiday demand. Historical seasonal patterns may not continue in the future and have been impacted by supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior, continuing impacts of the macroeconomic challenges and different demand dynamics.\nFor a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTransformation Update\nIn October 2019, we announced cost-reduction and operational efficiency initiatives intended to simplify the way we work, move us closer to our customers, and facilitate specific investment in our business. These initiatives were further updated in February 2020. These efforts included transforming our operating model to integrate our sales force into a single commercial organization and reducing structural costs across HP through our restructuring plan approved in September 2019 (the Fiscal 2020 Plan).\nIn the third year of our program, we completed our Fiscal 2020 Plan, generating over $1.3 billion dollars in gross annual run-rate structural costs savings, ahead of our $1.2 billion dollar goal. We have changed our operating model to simplify the way we are structured and the way we work to free up capacity, create scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. We focused on real estate and site optimization in alignment with our location strategy. We have also focused on creating efficient digital workspaces with the transition to a hybrid work model, which is in line with real estate optimization. We made significant progress in optimizing our manufacturing footprint including factory locations (China, India, Puerto Rico) while investing in a best-in-class supply chain network and product supply resiliency. We have invested a portion of the savings from these efforts across our businesses, including investing to build our digital capabilities such as deployment of our SAP S/4 HANA system, one of the largest ERP implementations. Now that the Fiscal 2020 plan is complete, we are now starting on the next phase in our transformation.\nIn November 2022, we announced our Future Ready Plan (the Fiscal 2023 Plan) to become a more digitally enabled company, focus investments on key growth opportunities and simplify our operating model. The new Fiscal 2023 plan is expected to run for three years through end of fiscal 2025. The three key elements of our Fiscal 2023 plan are digital transformation, portfolio optimization, and operational efficiency. As part of digital transformation, we will continue the process of digitizing the company to simplify and accelerate many processes through automation and end-to-end management. As part of optimizing our portfolio, we plan to continue to invest in our key growth areas of Peripherals, Gaming, Workforce Services & Solutions, Consumer Subscriptions and Industrial Graphics and 3D, to drive competitive advantage and market leadership and we also plan to simplify our portfolio to reduce complexity. Further to achieve operational efficiency, we plan to optimize our performance by driving efficiencies, simplifying organizational structures, and optimizing costs. We expect to invest some of the savings from these efforts across our businesses to be more efficient and advance our positions in Personal Systems and Printing, while also disrupting new industries where we see attractive growth opportunities. We also plan to use some of these savings to partially offset headwinds we expect to see across our businesses in fiscal 2023 as a result of macroeconomic factors.\nSee Risk Factors- We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. For more information on our Fiscal 2020 Plan and Fiscal 2023 Plan, see Note 3, Restructuring and Other Charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nOracle Corporation (Oracle) Litigation proceeds\nOn October 12, 2021, Oracle paid approximately $4.65 billion, to satisfy the judgment with interest, related to the litigation in connection with Oracles discontinuation of software support for former Hewlett-Packard Companys Itanium-based line of mission-critical servers. The net proceeds from the judgement were shared equally between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Poly, a leading global provider of workplace collaboration solutions, in an all-cash transaction for $40 per share, implying a total enterprise value of $3.3 billion, inclusive of Polys net debt. Poly is a leader in video conferencing solutions, cameras, headsets, voice and software. With the acquisition, we aim to deliver a complete ecosystem of devices, software, and digital services to create premium employee experiences, improve workforce productivity, and provide enterprise customers with better visibility, insights, security, and manageability across their hybrid IT environments. The financial results of Poly are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022, from the date of the acquisition. We expect to complete the integration of Poly to HPs system and process by the end of fiscal year 2023.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nOn September 1, 2022, we consummated our offer (the Exchange Offer) to exchange approximately $0.5 billion of outstanding notes issued by Poly (the Poly Notes) for new notes issued by us with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as the exchanged Poly Notes. In conjunction with the Exchange Offer, certain proposed amendments that would eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions in the indenture governing Poly Notes were adopted, pursuant to a consent solicitation (the Consent Solicitation) conducted concurrently with the Exchange Offer.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nGeneral\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. As of October 31, 2022, the impact to our business from the changing macroeconomic factors continued to unfold. Additionally, HP continues to assess and evaluate impacts from the events in Russia, inflationary concerns, as well as certain supply chain disruptions. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change in future periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of HPs Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nA summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We evaluate customers ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores.\nWe enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are contracts which contain non-standard terms and conditions. Further, many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of performance obligations that are distinct, the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations.\nWe evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents distinct goods or services. A performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.\nTransaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. If the transaction price includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method. We reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. We use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on historical experience, expected consumer behavior and market conditions.\nWhen a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, such as hardware and/or services, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. The selling price for each performance obligation is based on its Standalone Selling Price (SSP). We establish SSP using the price charged for a performance obligation when\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nsold separately (observable price) and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. When observable price is not available, we establish SSP based on managements judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life-cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates. This may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement. In most arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. We generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. For fixed-price support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract. In instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. We consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks.\nWarranty\nWe accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts, labor and onsite services, depending upon the product. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty obligation may be required.\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Benefits\nOur pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and managements expected returns for each asset class. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. For the recognition of net periodic benefit (credit) cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim re-measurement.\nOur major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4, Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. The following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weighted-average assumptions of the discount\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nrate, expected increase in compensation levels and expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit (credit) cost for fiscal year 2022:\nChange in Net Periodic\nBenefit Cost\nin millions\nAssumptions:\nDiscount rate $ 7\nExpected increase in compensation levels $ 2\nExpected long-term return on plan assets $ 19\nTaxes on Earnings\nAs a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2029.\nMaterial changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the United States, and our related future effective tax rate.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and approximately 60 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, and our positions may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions, pension and related interest. We adjust our uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. Determining the appropriate provision for potential deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could reasonably result from an audit requires management judgments and estimates, and income tax audits are inherently unpredictable. We may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our provision for taxes, net earnings and cash flows. For a further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, Taxes on Earnings to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nInventory\nWe state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, ageing of inventory, technological changes, supply constraints, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent third parties to perform an appraisal. When determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. A qualitative assessment is first performed to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment may include changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events impacting the reporting unit. If we determine an impairment is more likely than not based on our qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment of impairment is performed.\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables. If we determine the carrying amount exceeds fair value, goodwill is impaired and the excess is recognized as an impairment loss.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property (IP), commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we share responsibility with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain matters, as discussed in Note 14, Litigation and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in Note 14, Litigation and Contingencies, are not a meaningful indicator of HPs potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2022, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue with the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis, which excludes the effect of foreign currency\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nexchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly exchange rates from the comparative period and excluding any hedging impact recognized in the current period, and without adjusting for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends, as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. The constant currency measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nResults of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nDollars % of Net Revenue Dollars % of Net Revenue Dollars % of Net Revenue\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 62,983 100.0 % $ 63,487 100.0 % $ 56,639 100.0 %\nCost of revenue 50,648 80.4 % 50,070 78.9 % 46,202 81.6 %\nGross profit 12,335 19.6 % 13,417 21.1 % 10,437 18.4 %\nResearch and development 1,593 2.5 % 1,907 3.0 % 1,478 2.6 %\nSelling, general and administrative 5,264 8.4 % 5,741 9.0 % 4,906 8.6 %\nRestructuring and other charges 233 0.4 % 245 0.4 % 462 0.9 %\nAcquisition and divestiture charges 318 0.5 % 68 0.1 % 16 - %\nAmortization of intangible assets 228 0.4 % 154 0.2 % 113 0.2 %\nRussia exit charges 23 - % - - % - - %\nEarnings from operations 4,676 7.4 % 5,302 8.4 % 3,462 6.1 %\nInterest and other, net (235) (0.3) % 2,209 3.4 % (231) (0.4) %\nEarnings before taxes 4,441 7.1 % 7,511 11.8 % 3,231 5.7 %\nProvision for taxes (1,238) (2.0) % (1,008) (1.6) % (387) (0.7) %\nNet earnings $ 3,203 5.1 % $ 6,503 10.2 % $ 2,844 5.0 %\nNet Revenue\nIn fiscal year 2022, total net revenue decreased 0.8% (increased 0.7% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. Net revenue from the United States decreased 3.4% to $21.7 billion, and outside of the United States increased 0.6% to $41.3 billion. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, decline in Supplies, Notebooks and Consumer Printing, partially offset by an increase in Desktops, Workstations and Other Personal Systems. The decrease was driven by unit decline, partially offset by higher average selling prices (ASPs). Units were down in both Personal Systems and Printing due to supply chain constraints, and demand softness primarily in the second half of fiscal 2022 driven by the macroeconomic environment including inflationary trends.\nA detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under Segment Information below.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nGross Margin\nFor fiscal year 2022, gross margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and mix shifts, higher costs including commodity costs and reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher ASPs.\nA detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under Segment Information below.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development (R&D)\nR&D expense decreased 16.5% in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by increased investments in Personal Systems in the prior-year period, lower variable compensation and joint partner funding.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A)\nSG&A expense decreased 8.3% in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and go-to-market initiatives expenses.\nRestructuring and other charges\nRestructuring and other charges relate primarily to the Fiscal 2020 Plan. For more information, see Note 3, Restructuring and Other Charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAcquisition and divestiture charges\nAcquisition and divestiture charges primarily include, direct third-party professional and legal fees, and integration and divestiture-related costs, as well as non-cash adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as inventory and certain compensation charges related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units from acquisitions. Acquisition and divestiture charges increased by $250 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the Poly acquisition.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization of intangible assets relates primarily to intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. Amortization of Intangible assets increased by $74 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the recent acquisition of Poly, and the acquisitions of HyperX and Teradici in the fiscal year 2021.\nRussia exit charges\nFor the fiscal year 2022, HP recognized a charge of $23 million towards severance, cancellation of contracts, inventory write-downs and other one-time exit charges related to our decision to wind down our operations in Russia.\nInterest and other, net\nInterest and other, net for the fiscal year 2022 was net expense as compared to a net gain in the fiscal year 2021, primarily due to one-time gain from Oracle litigation proceeds of $2.3 billion in the prior-year period and increased interest expenses on senior unsecured notes. For more information, see Note 7, Supplementary Financial Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nProvision for taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 27.9% in fiscal year 2022. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to impacts of internal reorganization and favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were Singapore, Malaysia and Puerto Rico.\nFor a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% in fiscal year 2022, and further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 6, Taxes on Earnings to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we recorded $470 million of net income tax charges related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount included $649 million of tax effects related to internal reorganization, $118 million of uncertain tax position charges, $55 million related to withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, $51 million related to audit settlements in various jurisdictions and $26 million of other net tax charges. These charges were partially offset by income tax benefits of $183 million related to the filing of tax returns in various jurisdictions, $156 million related to changes in valuation allowances, $47 million related to restructuring charges, and $43 million related to Poly acquisition charges.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"Inflation Reduction Act\") into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the \"Corporate AMT\") of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (\"AFSI\") of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2024 and we have elected to treat any future Corporate AMT as period costs in the period they arise. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. We continue to analyze the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nSegment Information\nA description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.\nHP INC.

It is calculated by dividing the change in revenue of each business unit from the prior-year period by total segment revenue for the prior-year period.\n(2) Includes net revenue of Poly since acquisition date (August 29, 2022).\nFiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021\nPersonal Systems net revenue increased 1.7% (increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis) in the fiscal year 2022, as compared to the prior-year period. The net revenue increase was primarily attributable to Desktops, Workstations and Other, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and a decline in Notebooks. The net revenue increase was driven by 22.4% increase in ASPs, partially offset by 16.9% decrease in unit volume. The increase in ASPs was primarily due to disciplined pricing and mix shifts to premium, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The decrease in unit volume was primarily driven by a decline in Notebooks including lower Chromebook sales, partially offset by increases in Desktops and Workstations. In addition, units were impacted due to the overall macroeconomic environment, demand softness primarily in the second half of fiscal 2022, and supply chain constraints impacting certain parts of the product offerings.\nCommercial PCs revenue increased 10.5% primarily driven by higher ASPs and unit growth in Desktops and Workstations, partially offset by unit decline in Notebooks due to lower Chromebooks. Consumer PCs net revenue decreased 12.7% driven by unit declines in Notebooks, partially offset by higher ASPs.\nConsequently, net revenue increased 14.4% in Desktops, 25.8% in Workstations and decreased 4.4% in Notebooks.\nPersonal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.6 percentage points, primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin decrease was primarily due to the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives in the prior-year period, higher costs including commodity costs, and foreign currency impacts, partially offset by disciplined pricing and mix shifts. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points primarily driven by last years increased R&D investments, lower variable compensation and joint partner funding.\nHP INC.

It is calculated by dividing the change in revenue of each business unit from the prior period by total segment revenue for the prior-year period.\nFiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021\nPrinting net revenue decreased 6.1% (decreased 5.5% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior-year period. The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in Supplies, Consumer and unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by growth in Commercial. Net revenue for Supplies decreased 6.9%, primarily driven by consumer demand weakness, continued normalization in Home printing and the decision to wind down business operations in Russia, partially offset by the gradual recovery in Industrial print. Printer unit volume decreased 15.4% and ASPs increased 10.4%. The decrease in printer unit volume was primarily driven by decreases in both Consumer and Commercial due to component availability and supply chain disruptions. Printer ASPs increased primarily due to disciplined pricing and mix shifts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.\nNet revenue for Commercial increased by 0.4%, primarily due to a 7.7% increase in ASPs, partially offset by an 8.0% decrease in printer unit volume. The increase in ASPs was primarily driven by disciplined pricing and mix shifts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.\nNet revenue for Consumer decreased 11.3%, primarily due to a 16.5% decrease in printer unit volume, partially offset by 5.9% increase in ASPs. The increase in ASPs was primarily driven by disciplined pricing.\nPrinting earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.2 percentage points for fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. The decrease in gross margin was driven by lower Supplies mix, and higher commodity and supply chain costs, partially offset by disciplined pricing. Further, gross margin was impacted by component shortages and supply chain disruptions which impacted mix and unit availability for both Commercial and Consumer. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to lower variable compensation and go-to-market initiative expenses.\nCorporate Investments\nThe loss from operations in Corporate Investments for the fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects and investments in digital enablement.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that current cash, cash flow from operating activities, new borrowings, available commercial paper authorization and the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet HPs operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and post-retirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments for the foreseeable future. Additionally, if suitable acquisition opportunities arise, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the required financing through additional borrowings. While our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, we completed the acquisition of Poly, with a combined purchase price of $2.7 billion, net of cash acquired, of which $1.8 billion was recorded as goodwill and $1.4 billion as intangible assets and net liabilities assumed of $0.4 billion. For more information, see Note 18, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn September 1, 2022, we consummated our Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation. The approximately $0.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of our new notes mature in 2029 (the 2029 Notes), and an aggregate amount of $8 million in consent fee was paid in connection therewith. In addition, under the terms of the 2029 Notes, we are obligated to, within 60 days after the consummation of our acquisition of Poly, offer to purchase all or a portion of the 2029 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nOn October 19, 2022, we commenced the change of control offer for the 2029 Notes. On November 17, 2022, we consummated the change of control offer and paid an aggregate amount of approximately $498 million in connection therewith, to repurchase the approximately $488 million of notes tendered. On November 21, 2022, we issued a notice of redemption to redeem the remaining approximately $3 million of the 2029 Notes.\nAmounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the U.S. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax upon repatriation. As we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including reducing our gross debt level, or other uses.\nLiquidity\nOur cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and total debt were as follows:\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021\nIn billions\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3.1 $ 4.3\nTotal debt $ 11.0 $ 7.5\nOur key cash flow metrics were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 4,463 $ 6,409 $ 4,316\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,549) (1,012) (1,016)\nNet cash used in financing activities (2,068) (5,962) (2,973)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,154) $ (565) $ 327\nOperating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2022 due to lower net earnings as compared to the prior-year period, which included the one-time Oracle litigation proceeds of $1.8 billion partially offset by\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nworking capital management activities, reduction in receivables from contract manufacturers and payment of employee variable compensation accrued in the prior-year period.\nKey working capital metrics\nManagement utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level. The table below presents the cash conversion cycle:\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nDays of sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) 28 30 32\nDays of supply in inventory (DOS) 57 53 43\nDays of purchases outstanding in accounts payable (DPO) (114) (108) (105)\nCash conversion cycle (29) (25) (30)\nThe cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms and timing, extent of receivables factoring, macro-economic factors, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.\nDSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, by a 90-day average of net revenue. The decrease in DSO as compared to prior-year period, was due to higher factoring, partially offset by unfavorable revenue linearity.\nDOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. The increase in DOS was primarily due to lower cost of revenue and higher inventory for assurance of supply in Printing, partially offset by consumption of commodities in Personal Systems.\nDPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. The increase in DPO as compared to prior-year period, was primarily due to payment timing partially offset by lower purchasing volumes.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to Polys acquisition, lower proceeds from sale of investments of $0.3 billion and higher investments in property, plant and equipment of $0.2 billion.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher proceeds from debt issuance of $2.1 billion, lower share repurchases of $2.0 billion and lower payment of debt of $0.6 billion, partially offset by commercial paper activity of $0.8 billion.\nShare repurchases and dividends\nIn fiscal year 2022, HP returned total $5.3 billion to the shareholders in the form of share repurchases of $4.3 billion and cash dividends of $1.0 billion. As of October 31, 2022, HP had approximately $2.1 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations approved by HPs Board of Directors.\nFor more information on our share repurchases, see Note 12, Stockholders Deficit, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCapital resources\nDebt Levels\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021\nDollars in millions\nShort-term debt $ 218 $ 1,106\nLong-term debt $ 10,796 $ 6,386\nWeighted-average interest rate 3.7 % 3.1 %\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.\nShort-term debt decreased by $0.9 billion and long-term debt increased by $4.4 billion for fiscal year 2022 as compared to prior-year period. The net increase in total debt was primarily due to issuance of unsecured senior debt amounting to $4.0 billion during the year and exchange offer of $0.5 billion related to Poly notes, which was, partially offset by payment of $0.5 billion towards redemption of existing notes maturing in September 2022 and commercial paper payments of $0.4 billion.\nOur weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 10, Financial Instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nFor more information on the new notes and the redemption of existing notes, see Note 11, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAs of October 31, 2022, we maintained the 5-year sustainability-linked senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $5.0 billion which will be available until May 26, 2026. Funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes.\nAvailable borrowing resources\nAs of October 31, 2022, we had available borrowing resources of $937 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to the revolving credit facility.\nThe amendment to our 2019 Shelf Registration Statement to convert to a non-automatic shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on February 25, 2021 and, as of October 31, 2022, enables us to offer for sale, from time to time, in one or more offerings, $1.0 billion, in the aggregate, of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depository shares and warrants. The 2019 Shelf Registration Statement will expire in December 2022, around which time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement.\nFor more information on our borrowings, see Note 11, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCredit ratings\nOur credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information they obtain during our ongoing discussions. While we currently do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, a downgrade from our current credit rating may increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facility, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper, require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts and may have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position, depending on the extent of such downgrade. See Risk Factors- Failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. We can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facility, if necessary, to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nOur contractual and other obligations as of October 31, 2022, were as follows:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal Short-term Long-term\nIn millions\nPrincipal payments on debt(1)\n$ 11,190 $ 218 $ 10,972\nInterest payments on debt(2)\n3,721 415 3,306\nPurchase obligations(3)\n3,262 1,854 1,408\nOperating lease obligations 1,399 443 956\nFinance lease obligations 18 10 8\nTotal(4)(5)(6)\n$ 19,590 $ 2,940 $ 16,650\n(1)Amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums.\n(2)Amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. We have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our U.S. Dollar Global Notes to variable interest rates. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2022 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt.\n(3)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.\n(4)Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Contributions. In fiscal year 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $36 million to non-U.S. pension plans, $32 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants and $4 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. Our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(5)Cost Savings Plans. As a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect to make future cash payments of approximately $0.8 billion. We expect to make future cash payments of $0.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2025. These payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see Note 3, Restructuring and Other Charges, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(6)Uncertain Tax Positions. As of October 31, 2022, we had approximately $605 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, Taxes on Earnings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers and HP. For more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7 Supplementary Financial Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are outlined below.\nActual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in over 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2022 were Euro, Chinese yuan renminbi, Japanese yen and British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.\nWe use a combination of forward contracts and at times, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent in cost of sales. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2022 and 2021. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $134 million and $168 million at October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively.\nInterest rate risk\nWe also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio.\nWe issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We may use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve a floating interest expense and/or U.S. dollar principal outflows. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial.\nIn order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability in interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2022 and 2021. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of our debt and investments, net of interest rate swaps, of $210 million at October 31, 2022 and $73 million at October 31, 2021.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 6, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIncome Taxes\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Notes 1 and 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and several other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of those jurisdictions. Uncertainty in the Companys tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation and the Companys positions are subject to examination by taxing authorities, which may result in assessments of additional amounts owed. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires significant management judgment in estimating whether a tax positions technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nOur assessment of managements analyses of the reserve for uncertain tax positions is significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial statements and the assessment process involves significant judgment. For example, managements interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings are challenging to audit.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over managements processes relating to the recording of unrecognized tax benefits, including controls over the Companys process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions, including the above described judgments.\nOur audit procedures included an evaluation of the Companys key assumptions and judgments and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to determine the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized. For example, we evaluated the measurement of the amounts recorded taking into consideration the applicable tax laws and the Companys positions examined by taxing authorities. We involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Companys tax positions. This included assessing the Companys correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company.\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into certain contracts to sell their products and services that contain non-standard terms and conditions and multiple performance obligations. For such contracts, significant interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of the transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations.\nIn addition, the Company reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. The Company uses significant estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on factors like historical experience, forecasted sales, expected customer behavior and market conditions.\nOur assessment of managements evaluation of the appropriate accounting for revenue contracts and the determination of the variable consideration for sales incentives are significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial statements and the assessment process involves significant judgment.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested relevant controls over the identified risks related to the Companys accounting for revenue recognition, including the controls to evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment for contracts containing non-standard terms and conditions and multiple performance obligations and the controls related to the estimation process to record the variable consideration related to certain sales incentives.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, inspection of contracts entered into during the period, evaluation of managements judgments related to the interpretation of certain contract provisions including the identification of performance obligations, the method of allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the arrangement, and the assessment of the appropriateness of the amount of revenue recognized. We also evaluated the Companys key assumptions and judgments and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to determine the variable consideration for sales incentives. This included analyzing data related to the historical experience of sales incentive payments as well as understanding the current market dynamics that can affect the estimate of variable consideration to assess the Companys judgments and estimates.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2000.\nSan Jose, California\nDecember 6, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of HP Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited HP Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, HP Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Poly, which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 1.3% of total assets as of October 31, 2022 and 0.5% of net revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Poly.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of HP Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated December 6, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nDecember 6, 2022\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nHPs management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. HPs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HPs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of HP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of HPs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Poly, which we acquired on August 29, 2022, as discussed in Note 18, Acquisitions\". The exclusion represents internal control over financial reporting of 1.3 percent of total assets as of October 31, 2022 and less than 0.5 percent of net revenue for the then year ended. We have included the financial results of Poly in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nHPs management assessed the effectiveness of HPs internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on the assessment by HPs management, we determined that HPs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2022. The effectiveness of HPs internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, HPs independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 57 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n/s/ ENRIQUE LORES /s/ MARIE MYERS\nEnrique Lores\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nDecember 6, 2022\nMarie Myers\nChief Financial Officer\nDecember 6, 2022\nHP INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of HP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of HP and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which HP has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in HPs Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. As of October 31, 2022, the extent to which the current macroeconomic factors will impact our business going forward depends on numerous dynamic factors which we cannot reliably predict. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As the events continue to evolve with respect to the pandemic and ongoing macroeconomic factors, our estimates may materially change in future periods.\nForeign Currency Translation\nHP predominantly uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollars are recorded in U.S. dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and HP records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nOracle litigation proceeds\nOn October 12, 2021, Oracle paid approximately $4.65 billion, to satisfy the judgement with interest, related to the litigation in connection with Oracles discontinuation of software support for former Hewlett-Packard Companys Itanium-based line of mission-critical servers. The net proceeds from the judgement were shared equally between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement between the parties. For the fiscal year 2021, HP recorded a gain of $2.3 billion in Interest and other, net and corresponding tax impact of $0.5 billion in Provision for taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Oracle has exhausted legal appeals and has no further legal recourse to reverse the judgment.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. This guidance requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if the acquirer had originated the contracts. Under the new guidance, it is generally expected that an acquirer will recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with how they were recognized by the acquiree in its preacquisition financial statements. HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, with early adoption permitted HP has early adopted the guidance in fiscal year 2022, and the implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued guidance that enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs. Under the new guidance, companies that use a supplier finance program in connection with the purchase of goods or services will be required to disclose information about the program to allow users of financial statements to understand the programs nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. HP is required to adopt the guidance\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nin the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, except for the amendment on roll forward information which is effective one year later. Early adoption is permitted. HP is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nHP recognizes revenues at a point in time or over time depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which HP expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. HP follows the five-step model for revenue recognition as summarized below:\n1. Identify the contract with a customer - A contract with customer exists when (i) it is approved and signed by all parties,\n(ii) each partys rights and obligations can be identified, (iii) payment terms are defined, (iv) it has commercial substance and (v) the customer has the ability and intent to pay. HP evaluates customers ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores. While the majority of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are certain contracts with non-standard terms and conditions.\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract - HP evaluates each performance obligation in an arrangement to\ndetermine whether it is distinct, such as hardware and/or service. A performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from such goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.\n3. Determine the transaction price - Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which HP expects to be entitled in\nexchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. If the transaction price includes a variable amount, HP estimates the amount it expects to be entitled to using either the expected value or the most likely amount method.\nHP reduces the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive\nofferings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. HP uses estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on factors like historical experience, expected consumer behavior and market conditions.\nHP has elected the practical expedient of not accounting for significant financing components if the period between\nrevenue recognition and when the customer pays for the product or service is one year or less.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract - When a sales arrangement contains multiple\nperformance obligations, such as hardware and/or services, HP allocates revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. The selling price for each performance obligation is based on its Standalone Selling Price (SSP). HP establishes SSP using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold separately (observable price) and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. When observable price is not available, HP establishes SSP based on management judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles.\n5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied - Revenue is recognized when, or as, a\nperformance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. HP generally invoices the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. For fixed price support or maintenance contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract.\nHP reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, and the collected taxes are recorded as other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of revenue.\nHP records revenue on a gross basis when HP is a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when HP is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. HP considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether HP is the primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks.\nHardware\nHP transfers control of the products to the customer at the time the product is delivered to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain unfulfilled. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as revenue at the commencement of the lease.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nServices\nHP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support, maintenance and other service contracts over time depicting the pattern of service delivery and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that HP has transferred to a customer when such right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Such contract assets are not material to HPs Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenues when amounts invoiced to customers are more than the revenues recognized or when payments are received in advance for fixed-price support or maintenance contracts. The short-term and long-term deferred revenues are reported within the other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities respectively.\nCost to obtain a contract and fulfillment cost\nIncremental direct costs of obtaining a contract primarily consist of sales commissions. HP has elected the practical expedient to expense as incurred the costs to obtain a contract with a benefit period equal to or less than one year. For contracts with a period of benefit greater than one year, HP capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and amortizes these costs over their expected period of benefit provided such costs are recoverable.\nFulfillment costs consist of set-up and transition costs related to other service contracts. These costs generate or enhance resources of HP that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future and are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of the benefit, provided such costs are recoverable.\nSee Note 7, Supplementary Financial Information for details on net revenue by region, cost to obtain a contract and fulfillment cost, contract liabilities and value of remaining performance obligations.\nLeases\nAt the inception of a contract, HP assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether HP obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether HP has the right to direct the use of the asset.\nAll significant lease arrangements are recognized at lease commencement. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. HP determines the lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably certain. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, HP uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate at the commencement date to determine the present value of future payments that are reasonably certain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nHP determines stock-based compensation expense based on the measurement date fair value of the award. HP recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. HP determines compensation costs at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. HP estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience.\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Plans\nHP has various defined benefit, other contributory and non-contributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life of participants. In limited cases, HP amortizes actuarial gains and losses using the corridor approach. See Note 4, Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies.\nAdvertising cost\nCosts to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $696 million, $829 million and $530 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nHP records charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of HPs business segments, to remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate innovation. Restructuring charges can include severance costs to reduce a specified number of employees, enhanced early retirement incentives, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\ncontract cancellation costs. HP records restructuring charges based on estimated employee terminations, committed early retirements and site closure and consolidation plans. HP accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. Other charges include non-recurring costs, including those as a result of information technology rationalization efforts and proxy contest activities, and are distinct from ongoing operational costs.\nTaxes on Earnings\nHP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nHP records accruals for uncertain tax positions when HP believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. HP makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions, as well as any related interest and penalties.\nAccounts Receivable\nHP records allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses inherent in the asset over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is maintained based on the relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nHP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when HP becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, HP further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. HP assesses collectability by pooling receivables where similar risk characteristics exist.\nHP maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, financial condition of customers, length of time receivables are past due, trends in the weighted-average risk rating for the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time events, and historical experience. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable.\nHP utilizes certain third-party arrangements in the normal course of business as part of HPs cash and liquidity management and also to provide liquidity to certain partners to facilitate their working capital requirements. These financing arrangements, which in certain cases provide for partial recourse, result in the transfer of HPs trade receivables to a third-party. HP reflects amounts transferred to, but not yet collected from the third-party in Accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers and derivatives.\nHP maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and HPs policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management processes, HP performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. HP utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency, interest rate and, on certain investment exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss. The likelihood of which HP deems to be remote.\nHP sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties. If the financial condition or operations of these distributors and resellers aggregated business deteriorates substantially, HPs operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor and reseller receivable balances, which were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe, collectively represented approximately 52% and 42% of gross accounts receivable as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Two customers TD Synnex Corp and Ingram Micro Inc., accounted for 13.8% and 10.4%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nas of October 31, 2022. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of gross accounts receivable as of October 31, 2021. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable is generally diversified due to HPs large customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic markets. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.\nHP utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. HP may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. The three largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 89% and 85% of HPs supplier receivables of $0.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. HP includes the supplier receivables in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis. HPs credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part, by the amount HP owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as HP generally has the legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables. HP does not reflect the sale of these components in net revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the related products are sold by HP, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of revenue.\nHP obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers like Canon, due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of HPs relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect HPs net revenue, cash flows and gross margins.\nInventory\nHP values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Adjustments, if required, to reduce the cost of inventory to market (net realizable value) are made for estimated excess, obsolete or impaired balances after considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nHP reflects property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are five to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. HP depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipments estimated residual value. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nInternal Use Software and Cloud Computing Arrangements\nHP capitalizes external costs and directly attributable internal costs to acquire or create internal use software which are incurred subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. These costs relate to activities such as software design, configuration, coding, testing, and installation. Costs related to post-implementation activities such as training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Once the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, capitalized development costs are amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of the software, generally not to exceed five years.\nHP also enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts. For internal-use software obtained through a hosting arrangement that is in the nature of a service contract, HP incurs certain implementation costs such as integrating, configuring, and software customization, which are consistent with costs incurred during the application development stage for on-premise software. HP applies the same guidance to determine costs that are eligible for capitalization. For these arrangements, HP amortizes the capitalized development costs straight-line over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. HP also applies the same impairment model to both internal-use software and capitalized implementation costs in a software hosting arrangement that is in the nature of a service contract.\nBusiness Combinations\nHP includes the results of operations of the acquired business in HPs consolidated results prospectively from the acquisition date. HP allocates the purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and HP, and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify for recognition as an\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nintangible asset. Acquisition and divestiture charges are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. These charges primarily include, direct third-party professional and legal fees, integration and divestiture-related costs, as well as non-cash adjustments to the fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory and certain compensation charges related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units of acquired companies.\nGoodwill\nHP reviews goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. HP can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or HP can directly perform the quantitative impairment test. Based on the qualitative assessment, if HP determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed.\nIn the quantitative impairment test, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, HP estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. HP bases cash flow projections on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. HP bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, HP estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. HP weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, HP estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of HPs reporting units, HP compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to HPs market capitalization on an overall basis and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair value over HPs market capitalization on an overall basis). HP evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is determined to not be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, HP re-evaluates its reporting unit fair values, which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This re-evaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting units carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.\nDebt and Marketable Equity Securities Investments\nHP determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. Debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Marketable debt securities with maturities of twelve months or less are classified as short-term investments and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than twelve months are classified based on their availability for use in current operations. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, credit losses and impairments on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are calculated at the individual security level and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nHP monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment and credit losses on a quarterly basis. If HP intends to sell a debt security or it is more likely than not that HP will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in Interest and other, net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.\nIn other cases, if the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit related reasons, HP records a credit loss allowance, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. HP recognizes the corresponding charge in Interest and other, net and the remaining unrealized\nHP INC.

Factors that HP considers while determining the credit loss allowance includes, but is not limited to, severity and the reason for the decline in value, interest rate changes and counterparty long-term ratings.\nDerivatives\nHP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, treasury rate locks, forward starting swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain investment exposures. HP also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 10, Financial Instruments for a full description of HPs derivative instrument activities and related accounting policies.\nLoss Contingencies\nHP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 14, Litigation and Contingencies for a full description of HPs loss contingencies and related accounting policies.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 2: Segment Information\nHP is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions and services. HP sells to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. HP goes to market through its extensive channel network and direct sales.\nHPs operations are organized into three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing, and Corporate Investments. HPs organizational structure is based on many factors that the chief operating decision maker (CODM) uses to evaluate, view and run the business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by HPs CODM to evaluate segment results. The CODM uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the overall business, including earnings from operations, and uses these results to allocate resources to each of the segments.\nA summary description of each segment is as follows:\nPersonal Systems offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook personal computers (PCs), workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail point-of-sale (POS) systems, displays and peripherals, software, support and services. HP groups commercial notebooks, commercial desktops, commercial services, commercial mobility devices, commercial detachables and convertibles, workstations, retail POS systems and thin clients into commercial PCs and consumer notebooks, consumer desktops, consumer services and consumer detachables into consumer PCs when describing performance in these markets.

See Note 4 Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans for further information.\nFiscal 2023 Plan\nOn November 18, 2022, HPs Board of Directors approved the Fiscal 2023 Plan intended to enable digital transformation, portfolio optimization and operational efficiency that HP expects will be implemented through fiscal 2025. HP expects to reduce global headcount by approximately 4,000 to 6,000 employees. HP estimates that it will incur pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 billion relating to labor and non-labor actions. HP expects to incur approximately $0.7 billion primarily in labor costs related to workforce reductions and the remaining costs will relate to non-labor actions and other charges.\nFiscal 2020 Plan\nOn September 30, 2019, HPs Board of Directors approved the Fiscal 2020 Plan intended to optimize and simplify its operating model and cost structure that has been implemented through fiscal 2022. The Fiscal 2020 Plan is substantially complete. HP does not expect any significant further costs associated with the plan. Approximately 7,700 employees departed as part of the plan through a combination of employee exits and voluntary EER. HP incurred $740 million in severance costs and $281 million in infrastructure costs related to non-labor and other charges.\nOther charges\nOther charges include non-recurring costs, including those as a result of information technology rationalization efforts and proxy contest activities, and are distinct from ongoing operational costs. These costs primarily relate to third-party professional services and other non-recurring costs. HP incurred $25 million, $22 million and $105 million of other charges in fiscal year 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nHP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide. The most significant defined benefit plan, the HP Inc. Pension Plan (Pension Plan) is a frozen plan in the United States.\nHP reduces the benefit payable to certain U.S. employees under the Pension Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HPs frozen defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (DPSP). At October 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of plan assets of the DPSP was $366 million and $482 million, respectively. The DPSP obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Pension Plan when HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations.\nIn August 2021, HP entered into an agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential) to purchase an irrevocable group annuity contract and transfer approximately $5.2 billion of the Pension Plan obligations. Under the agreement, Prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 41,000 retirees and beneficiaries, with no changes to the amount or timing of monthly retirement benefit payments. This transaction closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and was funded by the assets of the Pension Plan. HP recorded a settlement gain of approximately $39 million in Interest and other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, with no cash flow impact.\nPost-Retirement Benefit Plans\nHP sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, of which the most significant are in the United States. Under the HP Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan, certain pre-2003 retirees and grandfathered participants with continuous service to HP since 2002 are eligible to receive partially subsidized medical coverage based on years of service at retirement. HPs share of the premium cost is capped for all subsidized medical coverage provided under the HP Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan. HP currently leverages the employer group waiver plan process to provide HP Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan post-65 prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D, thereby giving HP access to federal subsidies to help pay for retiree benefits.\nCertain employees not grandfathered for partially subsidized medical coverage under the above programs, and employees hired after 2002 but before August 2008, are eligible for credits under the HP Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan. Credits offered after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association upon attaining age 45 or as part of early retirement programs. On retirement, former employees may use these credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses, including premiums required for coverage.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nHP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was $119 million in fiscal year 2022, $112 million in fiscal year 2021 and $108 million in fiscal year 2020.\nU.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the HP Inc. 401(k) Plan when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The employer matching contributions in the HP Inc. 401(k) Plan is 100% of the first 4% of eligible compensation contributed by employees, and the employer match is vested after three years of employee service. Generally, an employee must be employed by HP Inc. on the last day of the calendar year to receive a match.\nHP INC.

The valuation of alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment. For alternative investments, valuation is based on NAV as reported by the asset manager or investment company and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including but not limited to the timeliness of NAV as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last NAV reported by the asset manager.\nPrivate equities include limited partnerships such as equity, buyout, venture capital, real estate and other similar funds that invest in the United States and internationally where foreign currencies are hedged.\nHedge funds include limited partnerships that invest both long and short primarily in common stocks and credit, relative value, event-driven equity, distressed debt and macro strategies. Management of the hedge funds has the ability to shift investments from value to growth strategies, from small to large capitalization stocks and bonds, and from a net long position to a net short position.\nThese investments also include Common Collective Trusts and 103-12 Investment Entities as defined in note (3) above and Investment Funds as defined in note (4) above.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)\nPlan Asset Allocations\nRefer to the fair value hierarchy table above for actual assets allocations across the benefit plans. The weighted-average target asset allocations across the benefit plans represented in the fair value tables above were as follows:\n2022 Target Allocation\nAsset Category U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined\nBenefit Plans Post-Retirement\nBenefit Plans\nEquity-related investments 19.0 % 34.0 % - %\nDebt securities 81.0 % 32.5 % 98.3 %\nReal estate - % 14.0 % - %\nCash and cash equivalents - % 5.5 % 1.7 %\nOther - % 14.0 % - %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nInvestment Policy\nHPs investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and HP may utilize derivatives to affect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nThe target asset allocation selected for each U.S. plan (pension and post-retirement) reflects a risk/return profile HP believes is appropriate relative to each plans liability structure and return goals. HP conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plans to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plans forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs and to develop a policy glide path which adjusts the asset allocation with funded status. Due to the strong funded status for the U.S. Pension Plan, consistent with our policy, steps have been taken to de-risk the portfolio by reallocation of assets to liability hedging fixed-income investments. HP also invests a portion of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide diversification and a higher expected return on assets.\nOutside the United States, asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. As in the United States, investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed-income securities than would otherwise be deployed. HP reviews the investment strategy and where appropriate, can offer some assistance in the selection of investment managers, with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan.\nBasis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns which considers each countrys specific inflation outlook. Because HPs investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.\nRetirement Incentive Program\nAs part of the Fiscal 2020 Plan, HP announced the voluntary EER program for its U.S. employees in October 2019. Voluntary participation in the EER program was limited to those employees who were at least 50 years old with 20 or more years of service at HP. Employees accepted into the EER program left HP on dates ranging from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. The EER benefit was a cash lump sum payment which was calculated based on years of service at HP at the time of the retirement and ranging from 13 to 52 weeks of pay.\nAll employees participating in the EER program were offered the opportunity to continue health care coverage at the active employee contribution rates for up to 36 months following retirement. In addition, HP provided up to $12,000 in employer credits under the Retirement Medical Savings Account (RMSA) program. In relation to the continued health care\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)\ncoverage and employer credits under the RMSA program, HP recognized special termination benefit costs of $44 million as restructuring and other charges for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020.\nLump Sum Program\nHP offered a lump sum program during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Certain terminated vested participants in the HP Inc. Pension Plan (Pension Plan) could elect to take a one-time voluntary lump sum payment equal to the present value of future benefits. Approximately 12,000 participants elected the lump sum option. Payments of $2.2 billion were made from plan assets to the participants in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. A non-cash settlement expense of $214 million arising from the accelerated recognition of previously deferred actuarial losses was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.\nFuture Contributions and Funding Policy\nIn fiscal year 2023, HP expects to contribute approximately $36 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, $32 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants and $4 million to cover benefit claims for HPs post-retirement benefit plans. HPs policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities.\nEstimated Future Benefits Payments\nAs of October 31, 2022, HP estimates that the future benefits payments for the retirement and post-retirement plans are as follows:\nFiscal year U.S. Defined\nBenefit Plans Non-U.S.\nDefined\nBenefit Plans Post-Retirement\nBenefit Plans\nIn millions\n2023 $ 308 $ 76 $ 32\n2024 320 46 27\n2025 330 48 26\n2026 328 50 26\n2027 333 55 26\nNext five fiscal years to October 31, 2032 1,575 334 125\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 5: Stock-Based Compensation\nHPs stock-based compensation plans include incentive compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense and Related Income Tax Benefits for Operations\nStock-based compensation expense and the resulting tax benefits for operations were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nStock-based compensation expense $ 343 $ 330 $ 278\nIncome tax benefit (59) (52) (48)\nStock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 284 $ 278 $ 230\nCash received from option exercises under the HP Inc 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, and ESPP purchases under the HP Inc. 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2011 ESPP) and HP Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2021 ESPP) was $53 million in fiscal year 2022, $55 million in fiscal year 2021 and $56 million in fiscal year 2020. The benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $4 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively.\nStock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans\nHPs stock-based incentive compensation plan includes equity plan adopted in 2004, as amended and restated (principal equity plan). Stock-based awards granted under the equity plan includes restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. Employees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards. The aggregate number of shares of HPs stock authorized for issuance under the principal equity plan is 626.0 million.\nRestricted stock awards are non-vested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards and cash-settled awards are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, ownership of the restricted stock cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. The dividends paid on restricted stock are non-forfeitable. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. However, shares underlying restricted stock units are included in the calculation of diluted net EPS. Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. HP expenses the fair value of restricted stock awards ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The majority of restricted stock units issued by HP contain only service vesting conditions. HP also grants performance-adjusted restricted stock units which vest only on the satisfaction of both service and the achievement of certain performance goals including market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.\nStock options granted under the principal equity plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plan permits some options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vest over three to four years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of HPs stock on the option grant date. The majority of stock options issued by HP contain only service vesting conditions. HP grants performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.\nRSU and stock option grants provide for accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plans and related grant agreements, including termination in connection with a change in control.\nRestricted Stock Units\nHP uses the closing stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of service-based restricted stock units. HP estimates the fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions using a combination of the\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 5: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)\nclosing stock price on the grant date and a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used to measure the fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions in the Monte Carlo simulation model were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nExpected volatility(1)\n41.6 % 41.0 % 27.6 %\nRisk-free interest rate(2)\n1.0 % 0.2 % 1.6 %\nExpected performance period in years(3)\n2.9 2.9 2.9\n(1)The expected volatility was estimated using the historical volatility derived from HPs common stock.\n(2)The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues.\n(3)The expected performance period was estimated based on the length of the remaining performance period from the grant date.\nA summary of restricted stock units activity is as follows:\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nShares Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nPer Share Shares Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nPer Share Shares Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nPer Share\nIn thousands In thousands In thousands\nOutstanding at beginning of year 30,197 $ 23 29,831 $ 21 29,960 $ 21\nGranted(1)\n15,337 $ 36 15,517 $ 25 18,109 $ 20\nVested (14,168) $ 22 (13,374) $ 21 (14,929) $ 20\nForfeited (2,678) $ 25 (1,777) $ 22 (3,309) $ 21\nOutstanding at end of year 28,688 $ 30 30,197 $ 23 29,831 $ 21\nThe total grant date fair value of restricted stock units vested in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $314 million, $278 million and $297 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2022, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units was $394 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years.\nStock Options\nHP utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting conditions. HP estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model as these awards contain market conditions. The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows:\nHP INC.

The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between HPs closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $25 million, $18 million and $12 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of options vested in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $9 million, $3 million and $3 million, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2022, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nHP sponsors the 2021 ESPP, pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of HPs common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2021 ESPP, employees purchase stock under the 2021 ESPP at a price equal to 95% of HPs closing stock price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met. The aggregate number of shares of HPs stock authorized for issuance under the 2021 ESPP was 50 million. The 2021 ESPP came into effect on May 1, 2021 upon expiry of the 2011 ESPP. The 2021 ESPP terms are similar to the previous ESPP.\nHP INC.

HP has elected to treat GILTI inclusions as period costs.\nIn fiscal year 2022, HP recorded $470 million of net income tax charges related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount included $649 million of tax effects related to internal reorganization, $118 million of uncertain tax position charges, $55 million related to withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, $51 million related to audit settlements in various jurisdictions and $26 million of other net tax charges. These charges were partially offset by income tax benefits of $183 million related to the filing of tax returns in various jurisdictions, $156 million related to changes in valuation allowances, $47 million related to restructuring charges, and $43 million related to Poly acquisition charges. In the fiscal year 2022, HP\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nrecorded excess tax benefits of $33 million associated with stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock.\nIn fiscal year 2021, HP recorded $9 million of net income tax charges related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount included income tax charges of $533 million related to the Oracle litigation proceeds, $15 million of uncertain tax position charges, and $9 million of other net tax charges. These charges were partially offset by income tax benefits of $393 million related to changes in valuation allowances, $89 million of tax effects related to internal reorganization, $50 million related to restructuring charges, and $16 million related to the filing of tax returns in various jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2021, excess tax benefits associated with stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units were immaterial.\nIn fiscal year 2020, HP recorded $244 million of net income tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount included tax benefits related to audit settlements of $124 million in various jurisdictions and $82 million related to restructuring benefits. Additionally, HP recorded benefits of $20 million related to proxy contest costs and $17 million of other net tax benefits. In fiscal year 2020, excess tax benefits associated with stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units were immaterial.\nAs a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2029. The gross income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were estimated to be $313 million ($0.30 diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2022, $385 million ($0.32 diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2021 and $344 million ($0.24 diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2020.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nBalance at beginning of year $ 820 $ 820 $ 929\nIncreases:\nFor current years tax positions 36 63 59\nFor prior years tax positions 299 92 71\nDecreases:\nFor prior years tax positions (61) (92) (89)\nStatute of limitations expirations (5) (9) (2)\nSettlements with taxing authorities (44) (54) (148)\nBalance at end of year $ 1,045 $ 820 $ 820\nAs of October 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1,045 million, of which up to $807 million would affect HPs effective tax rate if realized. Total gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $225 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. HP recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, HP had accrued $64 million, $70 million and $34 million, respectively, for interest and penalties.\nHP engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. HP expects complete resolution of certain tax years with various tax authorities within the next 12 months. HP believes it is reasonably possible that its existing gross unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by up to $38 million within the next 12 months, affecting HPs effective tax rate if realized.\nHP is subject to income tax in the United States and approximately 60 other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. In addition, HP is subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The IRS is conducting an audit of HPs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns.\nWith respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, HP is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2002. No material tax deficiencies have been assessed in major state or foreign tax jurisdictions related to ongoing audits as of October 31, 2022.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nHP believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. HP regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of HPs tax provision. HP adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that HP will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net income or cash flows.\nHP has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $5.1 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2022 because HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nDeferred tax assets:\nLoss and credit carryforwards $ 7,601 $ 7,630\nIntercompany transactions-excluding inventory 799 791\nFixed assets 118 136\nWarranty 170 207\nEmployee and retiree benefits 124 287\nDeferred revenue 221 192\nCapitalized research and development 654 454\nIntangible assets - 474\nOperating lease liabilities 238 227\nInvestment in partnership 70 95\nCash flow hedges - 8\nOther 353 444\nGross deferred tax assets 10,348 10,945\nValuation allowances (7,592) (7,749)\nTotal deferred tax assets 2,756 3,196\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nUnremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (75) (42)\nRight-of-use assets from operating leases (227) (215)\nIntangible assets (261) -\nCash flow hedges (155) -\nOther - (79)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (718) (336)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 2,038 $ 2,860\nHP INC.

In fiscal year 2022, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $157 million primarily due to foreign net operating losses, U.S. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate than the federal statutory tax rate, and the impact of the acquisition of Poly on the companys deferred tax assets. In fiscal year 2021, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $227 million primarily due to foreign net operating losses and U.S. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate due to certain future U.S. international tax reform implications. In fiscal year 2020, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased by $46 million primarily associated with foreign net operating losses and U.S. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate than the federal statutory tax rate due to certain future U.S. international tax reform implications.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 7: Supplementary Financial Information\nAccounts Receivable\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nBalance at beginning of period $ 111 $ 122 $ 111\nCurrent-period allowance for credit losses 7 5 62\nDeductions, net of recoveries (11) (16) (51)\nBalance at end of period $ 107 $ 111 $ 122\nHP utilizes certain third-party arrangements in the normal course of business as part of HPs cash and liquidity management and also to provide liquidity to certain partners to facilitate their working capital requirements. These financing arrangements, which in certain circumstances may contain partial recourse, result in a transfer of HPs receivables and risk to the third-party. As these transfers qualify as true sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are de-recognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon transfer, and HP receives a payment for the receivables from the third-party within a mutually agreed upon time period. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the recourse obligation is measured using market data from the similar transactions and reported as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recourse obligations as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the costs associated with the sales of trade receivables for fiscal year 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material.\nThe following is a summary of the activity under these arrangements:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nBalance at beginning of year (1)\n$ 131 $ 188 $ 235\nTrade receivables sold 12,028 11,976 10,474\nCash receipts (11,942) (12,035) (10,526)\nForeign currency and other (32) 2 5\nBalance at end of year (1)\n$ 185 $ 131 $ 188\n(1) Amounts outstanding from third parties reported in Accounts Receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nFinished goods $ 4,885 $ 4,532\nPurchased parts and fabricated assemblies 2,710 3,398\n$ 7,595 $ 7,930\nHP INC.

HP expects to recognize approximately $1.7 billion of the unearned amount in next 12 months and $1.9 billion thereafter.\nHP has elected the practical expedients and accordingly does not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if:\nthe contract has an original expected duration of one year or less; or\nthe revenue from the performance obligation is recognized over time on an as-invoiced basis when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer; or\nthe portion of the transaction price that is variable in nature is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\nThe remaining performance obligations are subject to change and may be affected by various factors, such as termination of contracts, contract modifications and adjustment for currency.\nCosts of Obtaining Contracts and Fulfillment Cost\nAs of October 31, 2022, deferred contract fulfillment and acquisition costs balances were $34 million and $34 million, respectively, included in Other Current Assets and Other Non-Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, the Company amortized $129 million of these costs.\nAs of October 31, 2021, deferred contract fulfillment and acquisition costs balances were $65 million and $36 million, respectively, included in Other Current Assets and Other Non-Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, the Company amortized $79 million of these costs.\nHP INC.

As of October 31, 2022, our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, Segment Information. There were no goodwill impairments in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. Personal Systems had a negative carrying amount of net assets as of October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 primarily as a result of a favorable cash conversion cycle.\nIntangible Assets\nHPs acquired intangible assets were composed of:\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nGross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net\nIn millions\nCustomer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements $ 815 $ 283 $ 532 $ 526 $ 212 $ 314\nTechnology and patents 1,763 551 1,212 814 425 389\nTrade name and trademarks 214 25 189 95 14 81\nTotal intangible assets $ 2,792 $ 859 $ 1,933 $ 1,435 $ 651 $ 784\nFor the fiscal year 2022, the increase in gross intangible assets was primarily due to intangible assets resulting from recent acquisitions.

Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 9: Fair Value (Continued)\nThe following table presents HPs assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nFair Value Measured Using Fair Value Measured Using\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nIn millions\nAssets:\nCash Equivalents\nCorporate debt $ - $ 904 $ - $ 904 $ - $ 1,112 $ - $ 1,112\nGovernment debt(1)\n1,289 - - 1,289 1,931 - - 1,931\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments\nFinancial institution instruments - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5\nMarketable equity securities and mutual funds 17 41 - 58 15 56 - 71\nDerivative Instruments\nForeign currency contracts - 1,088 - 1,088 - 277 - 277\nOther derivatives - 2 - 2 - 5 - 5\nTotal assets $ 1,306 $ 2,040 $ - $ 3,346 $ 1,946 $ 1,455 $ - $ 3,401\nLiabilities:\nDerivative Instruments\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ 78 $ - $ 78 $ - $ 24 $ - $ 24\nForeign currency contracts - 295 - 295 - 203 - 203\nOther derivatives - 1 - 1 - - - -\nTotal liabilities $ - $ 374 $ - $ 374 $ - $ 227 $ - $ 227\n(1) Government debt includes instruments such as U.S. treasury notes, U.S. agency securities and non-U.S. government bonds. Money market funds invested in government debt and traded in active markets are included in Level 1.\nValuation Techniques\nCash Equivalents and Investments: HP holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents. HP values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt investments is based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.\nDerivative Instruments: HP uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, HP and counterparty credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 10, Financial Instruments for a further discussion of HPs use of derivative instruments.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nShort- and Long-Term Debt: HP estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities and considering its own credit risk. The portion of HPs debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debts carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. The fair value of HPs short- and long-term debt was $9.6 billion as compared to its carrying amount of $11.0 billion at October 31, 2022. The fair value of HPs short- and long-term debt was $8.0 billion as compared to its carrying value of $7.5 billion at October 31, 2021. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 9: Fair Value (Continued)\nOther Financial Instruments: For the balance of HPs financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNon-Marketable Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets: HPs non-marketable equity investments are measured at cost less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. HPs non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets these would generally be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10: Financial Instruments\nCash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Investments\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nCost Gross\nUnrealized\nGain Gross\nUnrealized\nLoss Fair\nValue Cost Gross\nUnrealized\nGain Gross\nUnrealized\nLoss Fair\nValue\nIn millions\nCash Equivalents:\nCorporate debt $ 904 $ - $ - $ 904 $ 1,112 $ - $ - $ 1,112\nGovernment debt 1,289 - - 1,289 1,931 - - 1,931\nTotal cash equivalents 2,193 - - 2,193 3,043 - - 3,043\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments:\nFinancial institution instruments 5 - - 5 5 - - 5\nMarketable equity securities and mutual funds 50 8 - 58 42 29 - 71\nTotal available-for-sale investments 55 8 - 63 47 29 - 76\nTotal cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments $ 2,248 $ 8 $ - $ 2,256 $ 3,090 $ 29 $ - $ 3,119\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $46 million in fiscal year 2022, $31 million in fiscal year 2021, and $40 million in fiscal year 2020. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.\nContractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2022\nAmortized\nCost Fair Value\nIn millions\nDue in one year $ 17 $ 17\nNon-marketable equity securities in privately held companies are included in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounted to $110 million and $59 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nHP determines credit losses on cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level. All instruments are considered investment grade. No credit-related or noncredit-related impairment losses were recorded in the fiscal year 2022.\nDerivative Instruments\nHP uses derivatives to offset business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows and on certain existing assets and liabilities. As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, treasury rate locks, forward starting swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain investment exposures. HP may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and classifies the cash flows with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items. Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. HP recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs a result of its use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. Master netting agreements mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting HP to net amounts due from HP to counterparty against amounts due to HP from the same counterparty under certain conditions. To further limit\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10: Financial Instruments (Continued)\ncredit risk, HP has collateral security agreements that allow HPs custodian to hold collateral from, or require HP to post collateral to, counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of HP and its counterparties. If HPs or the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives net liability position. The Company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. The fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $82 million and $64 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days.\nUnder HPs derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting HP that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect HPs financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value Hedges\nHP enters into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in benchmark interest rates on HPs future interest payments.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nCash Flow Hedges\nHP uses forward contracts, treasury rate locks, forward starting swaps and, at times, option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and debt issuance. HPs foreign currency cash flow hedges mature predominantly within twelve months; however, hedges related to long-term procurement arrangements extend several years.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Stockholders deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, a series of forward starting swaps, which were executed with a total notional amount of $1.75 billion along with already existing forward starting swaps with a total notional amount of $1.5 billion, were settled upon the issuance of the senior unsecured notes, resulting in a gain of $79 million recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain will be reclassified to Interest and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings over a portion of the life of the related debt.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. HP also uses total return swaps to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.\nFor derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nHedge Effectiveness\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options, forward contracts and forward starting swaps designated as cash flow hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and 2021, no portion of the hedging instruments gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for fair value and cash flow hedges.\nHP INC.

HP incurred issuance costs of $17 million. HP will pay interest semi-annually on each series of the notes on January 15 and July 15, beginning January 15, 2023. In June 2022, HP terminated a series of forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.75 billion that were executed to mitigate the treasury rate volatility associated with this debt issuance. HP used the net proceeds from the offering, together with other available funds, to fund the purchase price of the acquisition of Poly, repay Polys existing term loan, and pay any related fees and expenses.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11: Borrowings (Continued)\nIn March 2022, HP completed its offering of $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $1.0 billion of 4.00% notes due April 2029 and $1.0 billion of 4.20% notes due April 2032. HP incurred issuance costs of $17 million. HP will pay interest semi-annually on each series of the notes on April 15 and October 15, beginning October 15, 2022. HP terminated a series of forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $1.5 billion that were executed to mitigate the treasury rate volatility associated with this debt issuance. HP used the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, repayment and refinancing of debt, funding of acquisition opportunities, working capital, capital expenditures, and share repurchases.\nAs disclosed in Note 10, Financial Instruments, HP uses interest rate swaps to mitigate some of the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in benchmark interest rates. Interest rates shown in the table of long-term debt have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.\nAs of October 31, 2022, aggregate future maturities of debt at face value (excluding unamortized debt issuance cost of $80 million, discounts on debt issuance of $17 million, and fair value adjustment related to hedged debt of $78 million), including other borrowings were as follows:\nFiscal year In millions\n2023 $ 218\n2024 123\n2025 1,239\n2026 1,048\n2027 1,009\nThereafter 7,553\nTotal $ 11,190\nPoly Exchange Offer\nOn September 1, 2022, we consummated our offer (the Exchange Offer) to exchange approximately $0.5 billion of outstanding notes issued by Poly (the Poly Notes) for new notes issued by us with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as the exchanged Poly Notes. The portion not exchanged, approximately $9 million, remains outstanding. Because the debt instruments are not substantially different, the exchange was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes resulting in a portion of the unamortized fair value adjustment of HP senior notes.\nOn November 17, 2022, HP consummated its post-acquisition change of control repurchase offer for the new notes issued by HP, and an aggregate amount of $498 million in repurchase price was paid in connection therewith.\nCommercial Paper\nAs of October 31, 2022, HP maintained two commercial paper programs. HPs U.S. program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion. HPs euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper outside of the United States denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed the $6.0 billion authorized by HPs Board of Directors.\nCredit Facility\nAs of October 31, 2022, HP maintained a $5.0 billion sustainability-linked senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility, which HP entered into on May 26, 2021. Commitments under the revolving credit facility will be available until May 26, 2026. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the revolving credit facility vary based on HPs external credit ratings and certain sustainability metrics. Funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes.\nOn August 23, 2022, HP entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility, pursuant to which the credit agreement has been amended to provide for interest rates at Term SOFR instead of LIBOR.\nAs of October 31, 2022, HP was in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility.\nHP INC.

In fiscal year 2022, HP executed share repurchases of 124 million shares and settled total shares for $4.3 billion. In fiscal year 2021, HP executed share repurchases of 224 million shares and settled total shares for $6.3 billion. In fiscal year 2020, HP executed share repurchases of 168 million shares and settled total shares for $3.1 billion. Share repurchases executed during fiscal years 2021, and 2020 included 1.6 million shares, and 2.3 million shares settled in November 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe shares repurchased in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were all open market repurchase transactions. On February 22, 2020, HPs Board of Directors increased HPs share repurchase authorization to $15.0 billion in total. As of October 31, 2022, HP had approximately $2.1 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations approved by HPs Board of Directors.\nTaxes related to Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nTax effect on change in unrealized components of available-for-sale debt securities:\nTax benefit (provision) on unrealized (losses) gains arising during the period $ 2 $ (1) $ -\nTax effect on change in unrealized components of cash flow hedges:\nTax (provision) benefit on unrealized gains (losses) arising during the period (328) (9) 20\nTax provision (benefit) on (gains) losses reclassified into earnings 195 (17) 28\n(133) (26) 48\nTax effect on change in unrealized components of defined benefit plans:\nTax (provision) benefit on gains (losses) arising during the period 11 (177) 11\nTax benefit on amortization of actuarial loss and prior service benefit (6) (17) (19)\nTax (provision) benefit on curtailments, settlements and other (1) 9 (41)\n4 (185) (49)\nTax effect on change in cumulative translation adjustment 3 (1) 2\nTax (provision) benefit on other comprehensive income (loss) $ (124) $ (213) $ 1\nHP INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 13: Earnings Per Share\nHP calculates basic net EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net EPS includes any dilutive effect of restricted stock units, stock options, performance-based awards and shares purchased under the 2021 employee stock purchase plan.\nA reconciliation of the number of shares used for basic and diluted net EPS calculations is as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nNumerator:\nNet earnings $ 3,203 $ 6,503 $ 2,844\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used to compute basic net EPS 1,038 1,208 1,413\nDilutive effect of employee stock plans 12 12 7\nWeighted-average shares used to compute diluted net EPS 1,050 1,220 1,420\nNet earnings per share:\nBasic $ 3.09 $ 5.38 $ 2.01\nDiluted $ 3.05 $ 5.33 $ 2.00\nAnti-dilutive weighted-average stock-based compensation awards(1)\n4 2 13\n(1)HP excludes from the calculation of diluted net EPS stock options and restricted stock units where the assumed proceeds exceed the average market price, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The assumed proceeds of a stock option include the sum of its exercise price, and average unrecognized compensation cost. The assumed proceeds of a restricted stock unit represent unrecognized compensation cost.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14: Litigation and Contingencies\nHP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of IP, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP accrues a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2022, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in HPs financial statements. HP reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement entered into with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP shares responsibility with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain matters, as indicated below, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify HP in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HPs potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies.\nLitigation, Proceedings and Investigations\nCopyright Levies. Proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in certain European countries, challenging the imposition or the modification of levies regimes upon IT equipment (such as PCs or printers) or the restrictions to exonerate the application of private copying levies on devices purchased by business users. The levies are generally based upon the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary. Some European countries are expected to implement legislation to introduce or extend existing levy schemes to digital devices. HP, other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and certain requirements for business sales exemptions, and have advocated alternative models of compensation to rights holders.\nBased on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HPs assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HPs estimates of the number of units impacted and the amounts of the levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the ongoing disputes.\nForsyth, et al. v. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This is a purported class and collective action filed on August 18, 2016 in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, against HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) alleging the defendants violated federal and state law by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. In their most recent complaint, plaintiffs seek to represent (1) a putative nationwide federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) collective comprised of all former HP Inc. employees 40 years of age and older who had their employment terminated under a WFR plan in or after 2014 or 2015, depending on state law; and (2) a putative Rule 23 class under California law comprised of all former HP Inc. employees 40 years of age and older who had their employment terminated in California under a WFR plan in or after 2012. Excluded from the putative collective and class are employees who (a) signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement at termination, or (b) signed an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. Similar claims are pending against HPE. Because the court granted plaintiffs motion for preliminary certification of the putative nationwide ADEA collectives, a third-party administrator notified eligible former employees of their right to opt into the ADEA collective. This opt-in period closed on February 15, 2022. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, punitive damages, and other relief.\nIndia Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings. On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the DRI) issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Limited (HP India), a subsidiary of HP, seven HP India employees and one former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties and interest. Prior to the issuance of the notices, HP India deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRIs agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts or interrupt business by HP India.\nOn April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional $10 million in connection with the products-related notice. The differential duty demand is subject to interest. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)\nindividuals of approximately $17 million, of which HP India had already deposited $7 million. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related notice so as to avoid certain penalties.\nHP India filed appeals of the Commissioners orders before the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the Customs Tribunal) along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $24 million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. On February 7, 2014, the Customs Tribunal granted HP Indias application for extension of the stay of deposit until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioners orders and rejected HP Indias request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The Customs Tribunal cancelled hearings to reconvene in 2015, 2016, and January 2019. On January 20, 2021, the Customs Tribunal held a virtual hearing during which the judge allowed HPs application for a physical hearing on the merits as soon as practicable, which will be scheduled when physical hearings resume at court. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify HP in part, based on the extent to which any liability arises from the products and spare parts of Hewlett Packard Enterprises businesses.\nPhilips Patent Litigation. In September 2020, Koninklijke Philips N.V. and Philips North America LLC (collectively, Philips) filed a complaint against HP for patent infringement in federal court for the District of Delaware and filed a companion complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act against HP and 8 other sets of respondents. Both complaints allege that certain digital video-capable devices and components thereof infringe four of Philips patents. In October 2020, the ITC instituted an investigation, and Philips later withdrew two of the four patents. On March 23, 2022, the ITC rendered a final determination that no violation of section 337 has occurred. Philips did not appeal and elected to resume litigation with its case in federal court. Philips seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against HP, and the prior stay has been lifted.\nCaltech Patent Litigation. On November 11, 2020, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) filed a complaint against HP for patent infringement in the federal court for the Western District of Texas. On March 19, 2021, Caltech filed an amendment to this same complaint. The complaint as amended alleges infringement of five of Caltechs patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,716,552; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833. The accused products are HP commercial and consumer PCs as well as wireless printers that comply with the IEEE 802.11n, 802.11ac, and/or 802.11ax standards. Caltech seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The court stayed the case pending the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in The California Inst. of Tech. v. Broadcom Ltd et al., Case No. 2020-2222, which was issued on February 4, 2022. On March 12, 2022, the parties filed a status report regarding whether the court should lift the stay, which remains pending.\nIn re HP Inc.

On February 19, 2020, Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. filed a putative class action complaint against HP, Dion Weisler, Catherine Lesjak, and Steven Fieler in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. The court appointed the State of Rhode Island, Office of the General Treasurer, on behalf of the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island and Iron Workers Local 580 Joint Funds as Lead Plaintiffs. Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which additionally named as defendants Enrique Lores and Christoph Schell. HP and the named officers filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court granted HPs motion to dismiss and granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs second amended complaint, which no longer names Christoph Schell as a defendant, alleges, among other things, that from February 23, 2017 to October 3, 2019, HP and the named officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements about HPs printing supplies business. It further alleges that Dion Weisler and Enrique Lores violated Sections 10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act by allegedly selling shares of HP common stock during this period while in possession of material, non-public adverse information about HPs printing supplies business. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief. HP and the named officers filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On September 15, 2021, the court granted HPs motion. Plaintiffs appealed the decision. An appellate hearing scheduled for December 5, 2022 was cancelled as the parties have reached a settlement in principle.\nYork County on behalf of the County of York Retirement Fund v. HP Inc., et al., and related proceedings. On November 5, 2020, York County, on behalf of the County of York Retirement Fund, filed a putative class action complaint against HP, Dion Weisler, and Catherine Lesjak in federal court in the Northern District of California. The court appointed Maryland Electrical Industry Pension Fund as Lead Plaintiff. Lead Plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint, which additionally names as defendants Enrique Lores and Richard Bailey. The complaint alleges, among other things, that from November 5, 2015 to June 21, 2016, HP and the named current and former officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by concealing\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)\nmaterial information and making false statements about HPs printing supplies business. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief. HP and the named officers filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On March 3, 2022, the court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice. Plaintiffs are appealing the decision. On May 17, 2021, stockholder Scott Franklin filed a derivative complaint against certain current and former officers and directors in federal court in the District of Delaware. Plaintiff purports to bring the action on behalf of HP, which he has named as a nominal defendant, and he makes substantially the same factual allegations as in the York County securities complaint, bringing claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of securities laws. The derivative plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, governance reforms, and other relief. By court order following stipulations by the parties, the case was transferred to the Northern District of California, and the case was stayed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss in York County. On January 13, 2022, stockholder Gerald Lovoi filed a derivative complaint in federal court in the Northern District of California against the same current and former officers and directors named in the Franklin action. The complaint alleges the same basic claims based on the same alleged conduct as the Franklin action and seeks similar relief. By stipulation of the parties, the Lovoi action was stayed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss in York County. Both derivative actions will remain stayed until any appeal related to the York decision has been exhausted.\nLegal Proceedings re Authentication of Supplies. Since 2016, HP has from time to time been named in civil litigation, or been the subject of government investigations, involving supplies authentication protocols used in certain HP printers in multiple geographies, including but not limited to the United States, Italy, Israel, and the Netherlands. The supplies authentication protocols are often referred to as Dynamic Security. The core allegations in these proceedings claim misleading or inadequate consumer notifications and permissions pertaining to the use of Dynamic Security, the installation of firmware updates, or the potential inability of cartridges with clone chips or circuitry to work in HP printers with Dynamic Security. Plaintiffs base or have based their claims on various legal theories, including but not limited to unfair competition, computer trespass, and similar statutory claims. Among other relief, Plaintiffs have sought or seek money damages and in certain cases have or may seek injunctive relief against the use or operation of Dynamic Security or relief requiring interoperability. If HP is not successful in its defense of these cases or investigations, it could be subject to damages, penalties, significant settlement demands, or injunctive relief that may be costly or may disrupt operations. Certain of these proceedings in Italy, the Netherlands and Israel have been resolved, have concluded, or have concluded subject only to HPs pending appeal. Civil litigation filed by Digital Revolution B.V. (trading as 123Inkt) against HP Nederlands B.V., et al. (Netherlands) in March 2020, including its competition claim, remains pending. Both parties have appealed. In addition, two putative class actions have been filed against HP in federal court in California, in December 2020 and April 2022, arising out of the use of Dynamic Security firmware updates in HP Laserjet printers and HP Inkjet printers, respectively. Plaintiffs in both cases seek compensatory damages, restitution, injunctive relief against alleged unfair business practices, and other relief. The cases are in their early stages.\nAutonomy-Related Legal Matters\nInvestigations. As a result of the findings of an internal investigation, HP provided information to government authorities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) related to accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred before and in connection with HPs 2011 acquisition of Autonomy. In November 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Sushovan Hussain, former CFO of Autonomy on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, and multiple counts of wire fraud. The indictment alleged that Mr. Hussain engaged in a scheme to defraud purchasers and sellers of securities of Autonomy and HP about Autonomys true financial performance and condition. On April 30, 2018, a jury found Mr. Hussain guilty of all charges against him, and that judgment was affirmed on appeal in August 2020. In November 2018, a federal grand jury indicted Michael Lynch, former CEO of Autonomy, and Stephen Chamberlain, former VP of Finance of Autonomy. The indictment charged Mr. Lynch and Mr. Chamberlain with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple counts of wire fraud. On January 28, 2022, the U.K. Home Office approved U.S. demands to have Mr. Lynch extradited to face the charges. In February 2022, Mr. Lynch sought permission to appeal, and his request is pending. HP is continuing to cooperate with the ongoing enforcement actions.\nAutonomy Corporation Limited v. Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain. On April 17, 2015, four former HP subsidiaries that became subsidiaries of Hewlett Packard Enterprise at the time of the Separation (Autonomy Corporation Limited, Hewlett Packard Vision BV, Autonomy Systems, Limited, and Autonomy, Inc.) initiated civil proceedings in the U.K. High Court of Justice against two members of Autonomys former management, Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain. The Particulars of Claim seek damages in excess of $5 billion from Messrs. Lynch and Hussain for breach of their fiduciary duties by causing Autonomy group companies to engage in improper transactions and accounting practices. On October 1, 2015, Messrs. Lynch and Hussain filed their defenses. Mr. Lynch also filed a counterclaim against Autonomy Corporation Limited seeking $160\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)\nmillion in damages, among other things, for alleged misstatements regarding Lynch. Trial was completed in January 2020. On May 17, 2022, the court issued its final judgment, memorializing its findings that HP succeeded in substantially all of its claims and that Messrs. Lynch and Hussein engaged in fraud, and dismissing Mr. Lynchs counterclaim. The court deferred its assessment of damages to a later, separate judgment to be issued after further submissions, but it has indicated that damages awarded may be substantially less than is claimed. Litigation is unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that HP will recover damages or as to how any award of damages will compare with the amount claimed. The amount ultimately awarded, if any, would be recorded in the period received. No adjustment has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this potential award. Pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share equally in any recovery.\nEnvironmental\nHP is, and may become a party to, proceedings brought by U.S. or state agencies or private third parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediation at several current or former operating sites and former disposal sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with environmental agencies.\nNote 15: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, HP may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which HP has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, HP would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. HP believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.\nCross-Indemnifications with Hewlett Packard Enterprise\nOn November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company completed the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hewlett-Packard Companys former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses. The separation and distribution agreement provides for cross-indemnities between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise for liabilities allocated to the respective party pursuant to the terms of such agreement. For information on cross-indemnifications with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for litigation matters, see Note 14, Litigation and Contingencies.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. HP also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the vendors and customers use of HPs software products and services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.\nHP records tax indemnification receivables from various third parties for certain tax liabilities that HP is jointly and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by those same third parties under existing legal agreements. HP records a tax indemnification payable to various third parties under these agreements when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The actual amount that the third parties pay or may be obligated to pay HP could vary depending on the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.\nWarranties\nHP accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failures outside of HPs baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties (Continued)\nHPs aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nBalance at beginning of year $ 959 $ 993\nAccruals for warranties issued 948 1,003\nAdjustments related to pre-existing warranties (including changes in estimates) (43) 28\nSettlements made (in cash or in kind) (988) (1,065)\nBalance at end of year $ 876 $ 959\nNote 16: Commitments\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nAs of October 31, 2022, HP had unconditional purchase obligations of $3.3 billion. These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on HP and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. These unconditional purchase obligations are primarily related to inventory and service support. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty.\nAs of October 31, 2022, unconditional purchase obligations were as follows:\nFiscal year In millions\n2023 $ 1,854\n2024 1,254\n2025 101\n2026 22\n2027 20\nThereafter 11\nTotal $ 3,262\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 17: Leases\nHP determines, at lease inception, whether or not an arrangement contains a lease. A significant portion of the operating lease portfolio includes real estate leases. Additionally, HP has identified embedded operating leases within certain outsourced supply chain contracts. Leasing arrangements typically range in terms from 1 to 11 years with varying renewal and termination options. Substantially all of HPs leases are considered operating leases. Finance leases, short-term leases and sub-lease income were not material as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 or for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that HP will exercise such options. HP generally considers the economic life of the ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. HPs leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee.\nOperating leases are included in Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities. Finance leases are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, Notes payable and short-term borrowings and Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs most of the leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, HP uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of a lease in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the rate of interest that HP would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. HP uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate.\nHP has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components as a single lease element for its real estate leases and certain outsourced supply chain contracts in calculating the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Where HP chooses not to combine the lease and non-lease components, HP allocates contract consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on relative standalone prices.\nHP reviews the impairment of the ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for other long-lived assets.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nOperating lease cost $ 233 $ 235\nVariable cost 99 101\nTotal lease expense $ 332 $ 336\nAll lease expenses, including variable lease costs, are primarily included in Cost of revenue and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the use of the facilities.\nVariable lease expense relates primarily to leased real estate utilized for office space and outsourced warehousing. These costs primarily include adjustments for inflation, payments dependent on a rate or index or usage of asset and common area maintenance charges. These costs are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.\nThe following table presents supplemental information relating to the cash flows arising from lease transactions. Cash \u2018payments made from variable lease costs and short-term leases are not included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities, and, as such, are excluded from the amounts below:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nCash paid for amount included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 233 $ 238\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange of lease liabilities(1)\n$ 363 $ 385\n(1) Includes the impact of new leases as well as remeasurements and modifications to existing leases.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 17: Leases (Continued)\nWeighted-average information associated with the measurement of our remaining operating lease liabilities is as follows:\nAs of October 31\n2022 2021\nWeighted-average remaining lease term in years 5 5\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.2 % 3.4 %\nThe following maturity analysis presents expected undiscounted cash outflows for operating leases on an annual basis for the next five years:\nFiscal year In millions\n2023 $ 443\n2024 337\n2025 223\n2026 123\n2027 101\nThereafter 172\nTotal lease payments 1,399\nLess: Imputed interest 119\nTotal lease liabilities $ 1,280\nThere were no material operating leases that HP had entered into and that were yet to commence as of October 31, 2022.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 18: Acquisitions\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2022\nIn fiscal 2022, HP completed two acquisitions. HP estimated the preliminary fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such fair values was recorded as goodwill. The preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based on preliminary valuations performed by third-party valuation specialists, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist us in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired during the measurement period.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to HPs consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following table presents the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those items that are still preliminary allocations, for the acquisitions in fiscal 2022:\nIn millions\nGoodwill $ 1,766\nAmortizable intangible assets 1,429\nNet assets acquired (337)\nTotal fair value of consideration $ 2,858\nAcquisition of Poly\nIn fiscal 2022, HP completed the acquisition of Poly, a leading global provider of workplace collaboration solutions at a total enterprise value of $3.3 billion, inclusive of the Exchange Offer. The purchase consideration of $2.8 billion included payment to shareholders in an all-cash transaction for $40 per share, amounting to $1.8 billion and repayment of Polys existing term loan of $1.0 billion. Poly's results of operations are included within the Personal Systems segment. The financial results of Poly are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022, from the date of the acquisition.\nOn September 1, 2022, HP consummated its offer to exchange approximately $0.5 billion of outstanding notes issued by Poly for new notes issued by HP with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as the exchanged Poly Notes. See Note 11, Borrowings for detailed information.\nOf the total consideration, $109 million related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units was allocated to the purchase consideration, and $81 million was expensed immediately. In addition, HP assumed unvested restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units (assumed awards) with a preliminary estimated fair value of $47 million allocated to future services to be expensed over the remaining service periods on a straight-line basis, of which $4 million was attributed to purchase consideration. For the year ended October 31, 2022, HP recorded stock-based compensation expense of $3 million related to these assumed awards.\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2021\nIn fiscal 2021, HP completed four acquisitions. The estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date for all four acquisitions, as set forth in the table below.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they were not material to HPs consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.\nHP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following table presents the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for all of HP's acquisitions in fiscal 2021:\nIn millions\nGoodwill $ 400\nAmortizable intangible assets 385\nNet assets acquired 120\nTotal fair value of consideration $ 905\nAcquisition of HyperX, the gaming division of Kingston Technology Company\nHPs largest acquisition in fiscal 2021 was its acquisition of HyperX, the gaming division of Kingston Technology Company which was completed in June 2021 with a total fair value purchase consideration of $412 million. The acquisition supports HPs strategy to drive growth in gaming and peripherals within the Personal Systems segment. In connection with this acquisition, HP recorded approximately $112 million of goodwill and $197 million of amortizable purchased intangible assets. ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to HPs management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nSee Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our internal control over financial reporting in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
