    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nTANICO INC. has been incorporated on May 3, 2021 in the State of Nevada. We have never been involved in any reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets, nor have we ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, management has developed a detailed business plan to provide customers with unique and innovative solution for their needs.\nProducts/Services\nDescription of Product or Services\nTANICO INC. is a new company that develops children's games that can provide valuable feedback to parents about child psychological well-being and early detection of any potential problems of psychological development. In the modern world, parents do not have enough time and experience to identify potentially dangerous psychological deviation in child behavior on early-stage (during early years of child development) and address it adequately.\nThe games we develop will generate specific situations and monitor the child's reaction. Multiple consecutive steps allow seeing some repeating patterns and trends. There are different types of games for each age, although by analyzing children's skills and intellectual abilities, the level of the games will adjust automatically. No personal data is stored on our gaming servers. Each account is only associated with parents email and/or with unique id number and password. Account is optional and is only necessary if parents would like to receive feedback. Parents will receive feedback regularly. In case of early problems, they will receive a recommendation to see a professional help for their child.\nWith parents consent we can provide data to help professional child psychologists to conduct long-term monitoring of child behavior and receive more information about child mental development. The psychologists can provide their valuable input on what game scenarios can identify different behavior patterns.\nTarget Market and Clients/potential Clients\nOur target market is any family with preschool children age 4 to 7 years old, also professional child psychologists who wants with parents permission to monitor child behavior on a long-term basis.\nDuring Phase 1 (initial stage) software development (online gaming, smart devices - smart phone, notepads etc.)\nIn Phase 2 - deployment, google play, apple, hosting gaming website.\nPhase 3 business development.\nSource of revenue\nWe have identified three main marketing client groups associated with the various streams of revenue:\nSource #1 - Parents, for small subscription fee they can insure those children grow healthy and happy\nSource #2 - Professional psychologists community, using our games for monitoring children with psychological deviations, for medical research.\nThe main target customer group will be parents. Today several billion people use personal computers or other internet enabled devices. Capturing a small sector of this user population could allow us to sell our products at a very attractive and affordable price.\nMarketing Strategy\nOur marketing strategy is to use inexpensive and widely available advertising vehicles such as\n1.\nThe company website\n2.\nYouTube\n3.\nSocial Networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc.)\nIf we can obtain more financial resources, we can include Google advertising offers.\nTo increase customer interest in our products we can provide a free product trial for a fixed period of time.\nAnother option is to provide light version of our application for free and to offer more security and functionality in a full edition version.\nThe pricing of our products will be inexpensive allowing to penetration of a wider customer base.\nSources and Availability of Products and Supplies\nWe do not depend on any suppliers or specific products.\nDependence on One or a Few Major Customers\nOur target market is mostly retail customers so we do not have any dependencies on one or a few major customers.\nPatent, Trademark, License & Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions\nThere are no inherent factors or circumstances associated with this industry, or any of the products or services that we expect to be providing that would give rise to any patent, trademark or license infringements or violations. We have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to obligations or concessions.\nOut web domain and IP address as well as company information will be protected by our domain host.\nWe do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.\nGovernmental and Industry Regulations\nThe company upon implementing its business plan expects to be in compliance with U.S. federal laws, including the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), 1999 Gramm-Leach Bliley Act that protects the rights and data of U.S. consumers, patients, minors and others.\nThe Nevada state laws (Nevada Revised Statutes - NRS)\nCHAPTER 603A - SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\nSECURITY OF INFORMATION MAINTAINED BY DATA COLLECTORS AND OTHER BUSINESSES\nState of Nevada Online Privacy Policy - Effective Date 11/25/02 | 3.03 B.\nWe will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the normal business operations.\nResearch and Development Activities and Costs\nWe are capitalizing on prior scientific research and development that was done by our President and Director and have not yet spent any money on R&D. Once this offering is completed, we will have resource to continue our R&D program.\nCompliance with Environmental Laws\nOur operations are not subject to any environmental laws.\nFacilities\nWe do not own or rent facilities of any kind. We conduct our operations from the facilities provided by Nikita Fenev free of charge.\nEmployees\nWe have only commenced limited operations and currently have no employees other than managing officers. Our President Mr. Anton Mikhalev spends approximately 20 hours per week on our business and our treasurer Ms. Maria Tomskaia devotes up to 12 hours per week to companys operations.\nDescription Of Property\nWe do not currently own any real property of any kind. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties.\nWe do not own any real estate or other properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nManagement is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this Year-End Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nThere has been no market for our securities. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the OTCQB or another quotation board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There is no assurance that a trading market will develop, or, if developed, that it will be sustained. Consequently, a purchaser of our common stock may find it difficult to resell the securities offered herein should the purchaser desire to do so when eligible for public resale. As of September 30, 2023, no shares of our common stock have traded.\nNumber of Holders\nAs of September 30, 2023, the 7,825,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of 34 shareholders of record.\nDividends\nNo cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nPurchase of our Equity Securities by Officers and Directors\nNone.\nOther Stockholder Matters\nNone. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this Prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOn June 20, 2023, a change of control of the Company occurred when Ms. Tatiana Fevena sold and transferred 5,000,000 of shares of common stock, representing 64% control of the Company, to Mr. Anton Mikhalev.\nOn August 29, 2023, Ms. Feneva resigned as Officer and Director, and Anton Mikhalev was appointed as Director and Chief Executive Officer and Director. Please see our Form 8-K filed on August 30, 2023 for further detail.\nOur cash balance was $14,299 as of September 30, 2023. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing funds received from our President and Director from the purchase of shares. He has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum of $25,000 (approximately $15,000 of which are legal and registration fees for a public company) of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period we may need additional financing, for which we currently dont have any arrangements.\nOur independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. For the year ended September 30, 2023 we have incurred a loss of $19,022 with total accumulated deficit of $44,600; no significant revenue is anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.\nTo meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand our proposed operations, however there is no guarantee that we will stay in business after doing so. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nResults of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2023\nFor fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we have generated $5,000 in revenue. There was no revenue in prior fiscal year.\nFor fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our operating expenses were comprised of professional fees of $22,463 and general and administrative expenses of $1,559 as compared with $16,735 of professional fees and $1,438 in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operations was $23,443 compared with $11,433 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Difference YoY due to lower accrued revenue in the current year.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $961, associated with the purchase of computer equipment. There were no investing activating in the current year.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, cash generated from financing activities was $4,448 compared with $29,561 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Difference YoY is primarily due to less proceeds from sale of common shares.\nTo date we have sold 7,825,000 shares of common stock.\nActivities to Date\nA substantial portion of our activities to date focused on becoming a reporting public company to raise more capital to finance our business activities. The Company has developed the Plan of Operations. We have established the company office and provided services to one customer. We have designed a new game for our customer.\nPlan of Operations\nWe expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.\nExisting working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nMaterial Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.\nPurchase of Significant Equipment\nWe do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had $14,299 cash and current liabilities of $25,890 as compared with $33,294 of cash and $29,843 of current liabilities as of September 30, 2022. The net operating capital of the Company is not sufficient for the Company to remain operational long-term.\nTo meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money through this Offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this Offering to expand our operations; however, there is no guarantee that business sustains long term. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this Offering.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected under this section of the JOBS Act to maintain our status as an \"emerging growth company\" and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions relating to complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. The Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. If we sell at least 25% of the shares in the offering we believe that we will have the resources to operate for the next 12 months, including for the costs associated with becoming a publicly reporting company. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $20,000.\nLimited operating history and need for additional capital\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nTanico Inc.\nSeptember 30, 2023\nIndex to the Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022\nStatements of Operations for the Year Ended September 30, 2023 and September 30,2022\nStatements of Cash Flows for the Year Ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022\nStatement of Shareholder's Equity for The Year Ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022\nNotes to The Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo: The Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nTanico Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tanico Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the two-years in the period ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two-years in the period ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company is a start-up company and had incurred substantial losses during the year and limited working capital, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regards to these matters are described in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe Critical Audit Matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ JLKZ CPA LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nJLKZ CPA LLP.

Our offices are located at 387 Whitby Shores Greenway, Whitby, ON Canada. The company will develop new type of computer games for the children ages 4 to 7. These games will encourage child intellectual development and provide parents with feedback on the progress of a child mental development. Our aim is to develop Tanico Inc. in phases. The first phase of development will focus on design solutions. The second phase will be further development of new gaming software solutions.\nNote 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices\nThe Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in the United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).\nCritical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Companys critical accounting estimate(s) and assumption(s) affecting the financial statements was (were):\n(i)\nAssumption as a going concern: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.\n(ii)\nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets: Management assumes that the realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.\nThese significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nManagement regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments.\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.\nThe estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable\nLevel 3 - inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modelling inputs based on assumptions)\nThe Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash is held on deposit with a federally regulated bank, where the first $100,000 of the deposit funds are fully insured.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include (a) affiliates of the Company; (b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d) principal owners of the Company; (e) management of the Company; (f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: (a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\nCommitment and Contingencies\nThe Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company did not have any commitments or contingencies as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Topic 606 on April 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. ASC 606 requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts.\nThe five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The company assesses these arrangements in accordance with Topic 606.\nLicense rights of use subscription\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is expected to be generated from right of use access to gaming software for individual retail clients. The generic software product can be used by a wide range of retail customers.\nThe performance obligation for retail clients is satisfied when the subscription period is expired. Therefore, revenue is recognized over time.\nSoftware modification\nThe Company may also provide software design and modifications for commercial clients based on special requests and contracts. The performance obligation for commercial clients is satisfied when the final product is delivered to a customer.\nWhen the modifications are ordered by a commercial client, such product is specified by the customer. Should a commercial customer withdraw from the contract of a modified product, such product remains as the Companys property.\nThe product is not controlled by the buyer until it is fully completed in a usable stage, where the buyer does not simultaneously receive and consume the economic benefits of the product or services provided. Such a product could be potentially resold to another party in due course without limitations; however, the Company may need to incur some additional cost for the rework of the product or some revenue loss on the resale of the asset to another customer.\nThe Company requires a 100% prepayment for commercial product modifications. The prepayment is recognized as a contract liability under deferred revenue. A partially completed project where the Company is at fault requires a full money repayment to the customer. When partially completed project is terminated at the discretion of customer where the Company is not at fault, no prepayment refund is issued.\nRevenue for software modification and development for commercial clients is recognized at a point in time, coincides with the delivery of a final product to the customer.\nThe contract specified the distinct performance obligation promises to the customer as follows:\na.\n90 hours of support free of charge is an additional service beyond the software development, design and modifications;\nb.\nthe customer can choose to receive additional assistance beyond the initial 90 hours is distinct from the core software development, design and modifications at an hourly rate of $40;\nc.\n2 days training with respect to the operation of the software; this training is a separate service that adds value to the customer and can be considered a distinct promise.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold one product, gaming software design, to Tal Sol Energy Ltd for $5,000.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Section 740-10-25). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\nManagement makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nNet Income (Loss) per Common Share\nNet income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants.\nThere were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the period from May 3, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2023.\nCash Flows Reporting\nThe Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (Indirect method) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Companys management has evaluated all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.\nNote 3 - Going Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nAs reflected in the financial statements, the Company is in a startup mode; it had an accumulated deficit for the year ended September 30, 2023 of $44,600 and a working capital deficit of $11,350 at September 30, 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is devoting substantially all of its current efforts to establish the business and its planned principal operations have not fully commenced. The Company is attempting to expand operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to continue operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 4 - Stockholder's Equity\nShares Authorized\nUpon formation the total number of shares of all classes of stock which the Company is authorized to issue is Seventy-Five Million (75,000,000) shares of which Seventy-Five Million (75,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nCommon Stock\nFor the period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 Company has sold an additional 2,825,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of $0.001 per share, for the total aggregate proceeds of $28,250, at the selling price of $0.01 per share.\nAll shares were issued in accordance with the exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 4(2) of such Act for issuances not involving any public offering and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, Company cancelled 180,000 shares for two shareholders. Both cancellations were made in a voluntary manner driven by the shareholders requests. Cash payout for these share cancellations were completed with no further amounts due and outstanding.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were 7,825,000 total shares issued and outstanding.\nNote 5 - Related Party Transactions\nChange of Control\nA change of control of the Company occurred when the transactions below were completed:\n-\nOn March 17, 2023, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Anton Mikhalev as Secretary of the Company.\n-\nOn August 29, 2023, Ms. Tatiana Feneva resigned from the position of President of Tanico Inc. due to personal reasons.\n-\nOn June 14, 2023, Ms. Tatiana Feneva sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Anton Mikhalev.\n-\nOn August 30, 2023, Mr. Anton Mikhalev was appointed the President of the Company.\n-\nOn August 28, 2023, Ms. Tatiana Feneva entered into an agreement to assign all the outstanding advanced balances owed to her to Nikita Fenev, who is a shareholder and child of Ms. Tatiana Feneva.\nRelated Parties\nRelated parties with whom the Company has transactions are:\nRelated Parties\nRelationship\nAnton Mikhalev\nPresident, CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and director\nNikita Fenev\nShareholder\nTatiana Feneva\nFormer officer and director\nRelated party loan\nOn August 28, 2023, the outstanding advanced balances were assigned by Tatiana Feneva to Nikita Fenev, pursuant to an agreement.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, Ms. Tatiana Feneva, the former President and a director of the Company, advanced the Company $948 for working capital, received $0 from the Company as repayments.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the outstanding balance payable to related party were $17,791 and $16,843 respectively. The advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.\nNote 6 - Deferred Revenue\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the deferred revenues were $nil and $5,000, respectively. The deferred revenues of $5,000 was recognized as revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 in accordance with ASC 606 which relates to the gaming software development.\nNote 7 - Concentrations, Risk and Uncertainties\nGeography:\nThe Company maintains its head office in Canada and operating in Canada, thus representing a foreign business operation.\nClient Concentration:\nOur target market is mostly retail customers. Occasionally, the Company may provide consulting or project services to other companies and organizations.\nThe Company has completed one project for one customer for the year ended September 30, 2023. We do not have any other pending contracts with this particular customer or any other customers.\nNote 8 - Income Tax Provision\nDeferred Tax Assets\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes of $44,600 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2039. No tax benefit has been recorded with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as the management of the Company believes that the realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets of approximately $9,366 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by the full valuation allowance.\nDeferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards which was used to offset tax payable from prior years operations. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realization. The current valuation of tax allowance is n/a as of September 30, 2023.\nComponents of deferred tax assets are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2023\nNet deferred tax assets - Non-current:\nNet operating income (loss) carry forward\n$ 44,600\nEffective tax rate\n21 %\nExpected income tax benefit from NOL carry-forwards\n9,366\nLess valuation allowance\n(9,366 )\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$ -\nIncome Tax Provision in the Statement of Operations\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes is as follows:\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nFederal statutory income tax rate\n21.0 %\nIncrease (reduction) in income tax provision resulting from:\nNet operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards\n(21.0 )%\nEffective income tax rate\n0.0 %\nTax Returns Remaining subject to IRS Audits\nThe Company has filed its corporation income tax return for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, which will remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for a period of three (3) years from the date it is filed.\nNote 9 - Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluates subsequent events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Subsequent to the date the financial statements were available to be issued there were no other subsequent events that would require disclosure to or adjustment to the financial statements other than those disclosed below.\nOn October 19, 2023 the Company engaged a sponsoring market maker and submitted Form 211 application to FINRA.
