BUSINESS\nDescription of Business\nBody and Mind is a multi-state cannabis operator, which has retail, distribution, cultivation, and/or processing operations in Nevada, California, Arkansas, Ohio and Illinois. The company is also engaged in the development of retail licenses in Illinois and New Jersey.\nOur platform approach to expansion focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions, entering new markets through lower cost license applications and opportunistic/targeted acquisitions.\nWe have developed the marquis lifestyle Body and Mind brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including flower, oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles.\nWe have a track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with winning licenses in new states and jurisdictions.\nWe are a Nevada corporation that, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nevada Medical Group, LLC (NMG), are engaged in the cultivation and production of medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products.

NMG LB received all approvals for final transfer of the licenses required to operate the medical and adult-use cannabis retail dispensary in Long Beach which was acquired by NMG LB at the end of August 2020, and the final formal closing matters are expected to close soon.\nWe, through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary NMG IL 4, LLC (NMG IL 4), pending regulatory approval of the ownership change, manage and operate the BaM Body and Mind branded Markham, IL dispensary since April 25, 2023. Formal regulatory approval of the ownership transfer is expected soon.\nIn Cathedral City, California, we had received a manufacturing and distribution licenses in 2021, however, upon evaluation of the expansion opportunity for a cultivation and manufacturing facility, we have decided to not advance this project any further and have let the licenses expire without renewal.\nWe, through our wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc., a Nevada corporation (DEP), acquired Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC (Canopy) in December 2022, which owns and operates The Reef by Body and Mind retail dispensary in the limited license jurisdiction of Seaside, California.\nIn Arkansas, we through NMG, manage the BaM Body and Mind branded medical marijuana dispensary including cultivation in West Memphis, Arkansas, which opened in April 27, 2020 and the cultivation commenced operations on April 6, 2021.\nWe, through our indirect subsidiary, BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc., own a New Jersey corporation, which leases a New Jersey retail location in Lawrenceville with local cannabis-use approval.

(formerly, CraftedPlants NJ Corp.) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DEP Nevada, Inc.\n(16)\nNMG IL 4, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DEP Nevada, Inc., pending regulatory approval.\nIncorporation and Early Corporate History\nWe were incorporated on November 5, 1998 in the State of Delaware under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, we acquired 100% of Kaleidoscope Venture Capital, Inc. (formerly Vocalscape Networks, Inc.) and changed our name to Vocalscape, Inc. In November 2005, we changed our name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc. In September 2008, we changed our name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (Deploy Tech) and effective November 14, 2017, we changed our name to Body and Mind, Inc. (Body and Mind).\nOn September 15, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (Deploy) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, Deploy completed a merger with Deploy Tech, its former parent company, pursuant to which Deploy was the surviving corporation and assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech. Upon the completion of the merger Deploy assumed the name Deploy Technologies Inc. and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploys - that is, our Companys issued and outstanding common stock.\nOn May 10, 2011, we registered as an extra-provincial company in British Columbia, and on September 30, 2011, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 2,900,000 shares of our authorized capital stock as Class A Preferred Shares (the Preferred Shares). On September 2, 2014, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the authorized Preferred Shares from 2,900,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares.\nOn November 11, 2014, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our authorized as well as the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Common Shares) on the basis of one (1) new share for ten (10) old shares. This resulted in a reduction of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 Common Shares to 10,000,000 Common Shares, and a reduction of our issued and outstanding Common Shares from 23,130,209 Common Shares to approximately 2,313,021 Common Shares. On April 11, 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized capital from 10,000,000 Common Shares to 900,000,000 Common Shares.\nOn September 14, 2017, we, with DEP, entered into a definitive agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with NMG, whereby DEP acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of NMG in exchange for (a) 16,000,000 post reverse-split Common Shares, (b) $2,000,000 cash, and (b) promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000, to the NMG securityholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interest in NMG. On completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, we assumed the business of NMG, being the cultivation and production of medical marijuana products.\nDevelopments in Fiscal Year Ended July 31, 2023\nAcquisition of Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC\nOn November 30, 2021, DEP entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the MIPA #1) to purchase eighty percent (80%) of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the Canopy Initial Purchased Interests) of Canopy from Cary Stiebel (the Continuing Owner), Jana Stiebel, Jayme Rivard, Adrian Dermicek, and Laurie Johnson (collectively, the Sellers). DEP also entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (MIPA #2) to purchase the remaining 20% of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the Canopy Remaining Purchased Interests and together with the Canopy Initial Purchased Interest, the Canopy Purchased Interests) of Canopy from the Continuing Owner. Both MIPA #1 and MIPA #2 were subsequently amended on June 17, 2022.\nOn December 7, 2022, the Company through DEP completed the acquisition of the Canopy Purchased Interests from the Sellers and closed MIPA #1, as amended, and MIPA #2, as amended.\nThe Company paid the following consideration for the Canopy Purchased Interests:\n(1)\n$1,250,000 in cash to the Sellers;\n(2)\nDEP issued a secured promissory note in favour of the Sellers for the principal amount of $2,300,000.00, which bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum compounded annually and has a maturity date of November 30, 2026 (the Promissory Note).\n(3)\nThe Company issued an aggregate of 16,301,694 shares of common stock to the Sellers at a deemed price of US$0.134 per share, 2,238,806 of which shares are held in escrow pending the results of a working capital adjustment in accordance with MIPA #1, as amended, and MIPA #2, as amended.\nSan Diego Dispensary Premises\nPursuant to an assignment and first amendment to commercial lease dated June 13, 2019 between NGM SD and Green Road, LLC, the parties agreed to amend the original lease of San Diego dispensary premises to permit NMG SD to have three (3) five (5) year renewal options as opposed to two (2) renewal options. On or around July 31, 2023, the Company decided to exercise the first renewal option to extend the term of the lease for a period of five years from December 1, 2023 to December 1, 2028.\nAgreement and Plan of Merger\nOn December 21, 2022, the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, DEP, BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ Inc., a New Jersey corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of DEP (the Merger Sub), CraftedPlants NJ Corp., a New Jersey corporation ( CraftedPlants) and certain shareholders of the CraftedPlants (the Sellers) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) whereby Merger Sub merged with and into CraftedPlants as the surviving entity (in such capacity, the Surviving Entity), and following the consummation of the merger, which occurred on December 21, 2022, the Surviving Entity became a wholly-owned subsidiary of DEP and changed its name to BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc. The Surviving Entity leases a New Jersey retail location with local cannabis-use approval, and is currently working on attaining final state licensure in New Jersey.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, DEP delivered a cash payment of US$50,000 to the Sellers upon closing, and a delayed payment of US$120,000 is to be paid to the Sellers upon funding of the project buildout.\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on December 21, 2022, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 16,666,667 shares of its common stock (the Merger Consideration Shares) at a deemed price of CAD$0.08 per share. The Merger Consideration Shares will be held in escrow and will not be released to the Sellers until the Surviving Entity achieves certain milestones, however, the Sellers will still maintain the voting and participation rights with respect to the Merger Consideration Shares while being held in escrow. The post-closing milestones are as follows:\n1.\nIf, within two years of the closing date, the Surviving Entitys application is approved and is granted pending license approval from the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the CRC), 70% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be released from escrow.\n2.\nIf, within three (3) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entity opens for business as a recreational cannabis dispensary, 30% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be released from escrow.\nIf either or both of the milestones are not achieved within the time periods after the closing date (the Milestone Dates), the Company shall have the option to cancel the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone by delivering written notice to Sellers and in the event of such cancellation, the portion of the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone shall be surrendered and cancelled without any further action required by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either or both of the milestones are not achieved (or if it becomes obvious that they will not be achieved) by their respective Milestone Dates because of delays that are not caused by the Sellers, the Sellers may, before the applicable Milestone Dates, provide notice to the Company, and the applicable Milestone Date will be extended to such date as is reasonably necessary for the milestone to be achieved. The parties will work together in mutual good faith to determine the dates by when the milestones can be reasonably achieved.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.3 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.\nLimited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement\nThe Company and its subsidiaries DEP, NMG, NMG OH 1, LLC (NMG OH 1), NMG OH P1, LLC (NMG OH P1), NMG LB, NMG MI C1, Inc. (NMG C1), NMG MI P1, Inc. (NMG MI P1), NMG MI 1, Inc. (NMG MI 1), NMG CA C1, LLC, NMG CA P1, LLC, NMG CA 1, LLC and NMG Cathedral City (each, a Guarantor and collectively, the Guarantors and together with the Company, the Loan Parties) entered into a loan agreement (the Loan Agreement) with FG Agency Lending, LLC (the Agent) and Bomind Holdings LLC (together with its successors and assigns, the Lender), dated July 19, 2021, as amended on November 30, 2021, June 14, 2022, December 12, 2022 and December 16, 2022.\nOn December 12, 2022, the Loan Parties, the Agent and the Lender entered into a Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement (the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement) to deal with certain events of default that occurred under the Loan Agreement, as amended, with respect to (i) the Companys failure to deliver to Agent the audited annual financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, on or before ninety (90) days after the end of such fiscal year in accordance with Section 7.2(c) of the Loan Agreement (the First Specified Default) and (ii) the Agent being informed that the Company anticipates that it will fail to deliver the quarterly financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2022, in form and substance acceptable to Agent, on or before forty-five (45) days after the end of such fiscal quarter, in accordance with Section 7.2(b) (the Second Specified Default, and together with the First Specified Default, the Specified Defaults).\nPursuant to the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement, the Agent and the Lender each waived the Specified Defaults on a limited one-time basis subject to the terms and conditions thereof until (i) with respect to the First Specified Default, 5:00 PM EST on December 30, 2022, and (ii) with respect to the Second Specified Default, 5:00 PM EST on January 13, 2023 (the Waiver Period)\u037e provided that if the Loan Parties do not deliver each of the Amended Deliverables (as defined in the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement) on or before expiration of their respective Waiver Period\u037e the waiver shall no longer be of any effect, and the Lender shall be entitled to enforce all remedies set forth in the Loan Agreement as of the date each Specified Default first occurred. The failure to time deliver such Amended Deliverables shall immediately result in an event of default and shall not be subject to any cure period.\nThe Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement became effective on December 16, 2022 (the Waiver Effective Date) the date on which the Agent received (i) the fully executed Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement, (ii) a non-refundable waiver fee of US$35,000, and (iii) payment of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of the Agent and the Lender in connection with the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement. Subsequent to entering into the Limited Waiver and Amendment to Loan Agreement, the parties verbally agreed and confirmed via email on December 20, 2022, that the Waiver Period for the First Specified Default shall be extended from December 30, 2022 to January 17, 2023, and the Waiver Period for the Second Specified Default shall be extended from January 13, 2023 to January 27, 2023.\nConsent and Amendment to Loan Agreement\nOn December 16, 2022, the Company, the Agent and the Lender entered into a Consent and Amendment to Loan Agreement (the Consent and Amendment to Loan Agreement) as the terms of the Loan Agreement provides that (i) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries is permitted to effect any acquisition or merger without the prior written consent of the Agent, and (ii) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries is permitted to incur indebtedness without the prior written consent of the Agent.

NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 were originally owned by Tall Bird, LLC (Tall Bird), a company owned by our social equity partner to meet local licensing application requirements and to compensate our social equity partner for role in obtaining the licenses, and Big Stone Illinois, LLC (Big Stone), a company controlled by the Companys Chief Operating Officer. The agreements are subject to final regulatory approval.\nOn December 26, 2019, the Company entered into management agreements with each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 along with an option to indirectly acquire all of the membership interests in each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 pursuant to a convertible credit facility between our subsidiary, DEP and each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4, and membership interest purchase agreements between DEP and the members of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4, subject to obtaining all required local and state regulatory authorization. Each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 have been identified in the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) results of the Social Equity Justice Involved Lottery for 55 Conditional Adult-Use Cannabis Dispensary Licenses (Conditional Licenses) across the state. The certified results are from a lottery with a pool of applicants who scored 85% or greater in their applications. NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 were drawn in BLS Region #5 (Chicago-Naperville-Elgin) where 36 conditional licenses are available. The applications are not tied to specified locations.\nOn December 2, 2022, Tall Bird assigned and transferred its membership interests in each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 to Big Stone. As a result of such transfers, DEP and Big Stock entered into first amended membership interest purchase agreements with respect to each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4.\nOn April 25, 2023, we, through DEP, obtained 100% ownership (pending regulatory approval) and control over NMG IL 4 in Illinois by converting the loan pursuant to the Convertible Credit Facility Agreement that the Company entered into on December 26, 2019 and by satisfying the closing conditions of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement that was signed on the same date. On closing, DEP delivered a cash payment of $1,000 to purchase 100 units (or 0.10%) of NMG IL 4 from the seller, Big Stone, and converted the Convertible Note receivable balance of $994,035 for the remaining 99,900 units (or 99.90%) of NMG IL 4. The Markham Illinois dispensary was opened around April 25, 2023 and operated as a BaM Body and Mind branded dispensary.\nOur second dispensary located in the Southern Chicago area received community approval from the village of Lynwood on February 15, 2023. Construction has commenced at the Lynwood dispensary site with building permits approved, foundations, walls and roof complete and groundworks ongoing. The dispensary will be a 3,600 square foot BaM Body and Mind branded store and is conveniently located on highway 83, less than 2 miles off both Highway 294 and Highway 30 in Eastern Illinois.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the convertible credit facility agreement between DEP and NMG IL 1 (the NMG IL 1 Convertible Credit Agreement), the convertible credit facility agreement between DEP and NMG IL 4 (the NMG IL 4 Convertible Credit Agreement), the membership interest purchase agreement between DEP and Big Stone with respect to NMG IL 1 (the NMG IL 1 MIPA), the membership interest purchase agreement between DEP and Big Stone with respect to NMG IL 4 (the NMG IL 4 MIPA), the first amended membership interest purchase agreement between DEP and Big Stone with respect to NMG IL 1 (the Amended NMG IL 1 MIPA) and the first amended membership interest purchase agreement between DEP and Big Stone with respect to NMG IL 4 (the Amended NMG IL 4 MIPA) do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the NMG IL 1 Convertible Credit Agreement, the NMG IL 4 Convertible Credit Agreement, the NMG IL 1 MIPA, the NMG IL 4 MIPA, the Amended NMG IL 1 MIPA and the Amended NMG IL 4 MIPA, which are filed as Exhibits 10.80, 10.81, 10.82, 10.83, 10.84 and 10.85 hereto and are incorporated by reference herein.\nStock Purchase Agreement and Management Services Agreement\nOn April 14, 2023, DEP entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) with Big Bhang Events, LLC (Big Bhang) and NMG MI 1, whereby DEP agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding common stock of NMG MI 1(the Acquired Shares) to Big Bhang, a prequalified applicant approved to hold a Recreational Adult Use License under the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act (the MRTMA), in exchange for a purchase price of $1.00, and subject to adjustment for any federal, state and local taxes due and owing by NMG MI or DEP as well as a working capital adjustment. On June 13, 2023, DEP sold the Acquired Shares to Big Bhang, as all of the closing conditions were satisfied or expressly waived, and NMG MI 1 received from the Cannabis Regulatory Authority for the State of Michigan approval of the transaction and the license amendment evidencing Big Bhang as the sole owner of NMG MI 1. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Big Bhang delivered a cash payment of $1.00 to DEP and DEP assigned, sold and transferred the Acquired Shares to Big Bhang.\nConcurrently and in conjunction with entering into the Stock Purchase Agreement, NMG MI 1 and Big Bhang entered into a management services agreement (the Management Services Agreement), pursuant to which Big Bhang provides management and administrative services to NMG, as described in Exhibit A to the Management Services Agreement, in exchange for a management fee equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the income and monies generated from the sale of all goods, products, and/or services relating to the business of NMG MI 1. The parties received implied approval of the Management Services Agreement from the CRA after submitting a License Maintenance update form on April 19, 20203 and the Management Services Agreement became effective as of May 1, 2023 and shall continue until the one (1) year anniversary thereof (the Term), which Term may be mutually extended by the parties, unless terminated earlier as set forth in the Management Services Agreement. In addition, during the Term, Big Bhang has full rights of management and control of the municipal and regulatory licenses, business, and the premises. Big Bhang may take any and all actions, either directly or on behalf of NMG MI 1, which Big Bhang deems, in its reasonable discretion, to be necessary in furtherance of the business, to the extent that such actions comply with applicable laws. Big Bhang may also change the trade or brand name of the business and/or premises during the Term, provided such change and name comply with applicable laws and are approved in advance by the CRA. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided in the Management Services Agreement, NMG MI 1 shall not, without the express prior approval of Big Bhang, take any action with respect to the operation of the business for which Big Bhang is authorized to take under the Management Services Agreement. Big Bhang shall assume all costs, obligations, liabilities, and expenditures of Licensee, which are incurred during the Term in connection with the services and the management and operation of NMG MI 1, the business, and the premise, and shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless NMG MI 1 from all costs, obligations, liabilities, and expenditures. During the Term, Big Bhang shall assume all risk of loss to NMG MI 1 and/or the premise, and shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless NMG MI 1 from all risk of loss.\nNMG MI 1 shall retain all rights in the Intellectual Property (as defined in the Management Services Agreement). Any Intellectual Property that may be utilized by Big Bhang in connection with Big Bhangs performance of the services under the Management Services Agreement will remain the property of NMG MI 1 or third-party company, and Big Bhang shall have no rights or interests therein, except as may otherwise be expressly provided in any separate agreement between the parties. In the event that Big Bhang acquires any rights in the Intellectual Property, by operation of law, or otherwise, such rights shall be deemed and are hereby irrevocably assigned to NMG MI 1 without further action by the parties. Big Bhang shall not, at any time during or after the Term of the Management Services Agreement dispute or contest, directly or indirectly, NMG MI 1s right and title to the Intellectual Property or the validity thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent it is required for Big Bhang to perform the services under the Management Services Agreement, NMG MI 1 granted Big Bhang a royalty-free, right and license to exploit and exercise all such Intellectual Property rights in support of Big Bhangs exercise or exploitation of the services.\nThe foregoing description of the Stock Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Stock Purchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.86 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.\nEquity Purchase Agreement (NMG OH 1)\nOn July 21, 2023, DEP entered into an equity purchase agreement (the EPA) with FarmaceuticalRX, LLC (Farmaceutical), whereby DEP agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding interests, equity, or profit interests (the NMG OH 1 Interests) in NMG OH 1, which owns and operates the Body and Mind Ohio dispensary, to Farmaceutical for US$8.225 million in cash, which includes a deposit of US$250,000 already paid by Farmaceutical to DEP, subject to adjustments based on estimated closing indebtedness, estimated transaction expenses, estimated closing cash, and a working capital adjustment. Closing of the transaction shall occur on the first day of the month following State of Ohio regulatory approval as well as satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. The transaction also includes a contingent US$2.5 million bonus payment to DEP for each additional dispensary license granted to NMG OH 1 by the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy in the future, excluding any adult use license for the existing license held by NMG OH 1 and current lease location.\nFarmaceutical and DEP entered into a side letter agreement contemporaneously with the EPA (the NMG OH 1 Side Agreement) to set forth the terms of their mutual understanding relating to operations and certain business decisions of NMG OH 1 during the period, starting at the signing of the EPA and up to and including the closing of the EPA with respect to scope of business agreement, management fee and expenses, ownership and control, limited trade license, regulatory matters, and miscellaneous matters, all as more specifically set out in the NMG OH 1 Side Agreement.\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, as amended, the Company, DEP, NMG OH 1, the Agent and the Lender entered into a consent agreement (the Consent Agreement), pursuant to which the Agent consented to the transaction contemplated in the EPA, including the sales of the NMG OH 1 Interests, and agreed to the provision of a UCC-3 Termination Statement and any applicable releases of all Liens (as defined in the EPA) on the assets and property of NMG OH 1, provided certain conditions precedent and conditions subsequent are satisfied.

The convertible loan agreement can be extended by either party and the current agreement has a maturity date of March 30, 2024. Under no circumstances the maturity date of the convertible loan agreement shall extend beyond the expiration of the management agreement.\nPursuant to the management agreement, NMG will provide operations and management services, including management, staffing, operations, administration, oversight, and other related services. Under the management agreement, NMG will be required to obtain approval from CCG for any key decisions as defined in the agreement and accordingly the Company does not control CCG. NMG will be paid a monthly management fee equal to 66.67% of the monthly net profits of CCG, subject to conversion of the convertible loan as discussed below upon which the monthly management fee shall be $6,000 per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The management agreement has an expiration of March 15, 2024 and can be mutually extendable.\nPursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP agreed to make loan advances to CCG from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,250,000 and as of July 31, 2023, DEP had loaned $1,250,000 to CCG, The loan proceeds were used to fund the construction of the medical marijuana dispensary facility, and to provide working capital to cover initial operating expenses. The construction was completed and all permits and licenses were received for the dispensary in late April 2020, which opened for operations on April 27, 2020.\nThe interest on the outstanding principal amount is currently set at $6,000 per month, payable monthly in arrears on or before the first calendar day of each month. Either CCG or DEP may unilaterally extend the maturity date by one year, and may thereafter continue to extend the maturity date on a yearly basis by increments of one year (each, an Extension Option) by providing written notice of the exercise of the Extension Option by the party seeking an extension to the other party; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall any extended maturity date extend beyond the expiration of the term of the Management Agreement entered into between NMG and CCG. The Company extended the loan maturity date by one year resulting in a new maturity date of March 30, 2023.\nOn or around August 22, 2023, DEP assigned the Convertible Loan Agreement to a related entity, Big Stone Farms AR 1, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company, which is wholly owned by the Companys Chief Operating Officer and Director, in exchange for an option to purchase the outstanding interests of Big Stone Farms AR 1, LLC for a purchase price of $1.00.\nThe management agreement between NMG and CCG remains in force and effect.\nMembership Interest Purchase Agreement (NMG OH P1)\nOn September 5, 2023, DEP entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) with LMTB LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (the LMTB), pursuant to which DEP will sell the issued and outstanding membership interests (the NMG OH P1 Interests) in NMG OH P1 to LMTB for the purchase price of US$2,000,000, subject to adjustment in the event that NMG OH P1s Working Capital (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) on the NMG OH P1 Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) varies from the Target Working Capital (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement and thereby fixed at zero (0) dollars). An amount equal to the Deposit (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement), being US$1,000,000, shall be held in escrow by Murphy Schiller & Wilkes LLP as escrow agent (the NMG OH P1 Escrow Agent) pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement entered into among DEP, NMG OH P1 and LMTB contemporaneously with the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement.\nClosing of the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement is subject to certain Closing Conditions (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), including but not limited to: (i) the approval of the State of Ohio Department of Commerce (the Ohio DoC) to change the ownership of the License (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) (the NMG OH P1 License) from DEP to LMTB pursuant to Ohio Admin. Code 3796:3-1-08; (ii) receipt of any other third-party consents required to effect such change of ownership of the License; (iii) renewal of the Lease (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) on terms acceptable to LMTB; and (iv) receipt from the landlord under the Lease and/or any lender to the landlord of all approvals required to permit LMTB to operate under the Lease.

Pursuant to the NMG OH P1 Side Agreement, LTMB will provide to NMG OH P1 certain administrative, finance and accounting, operational and compliance support during the NMG OH P1 Pre-Takeover Period.\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, as amended, the Company, DEP, NMG OH P1, the Agent and the Lender entered into a consent agreement (the NMG OH P1 Consent Agreement) on September 11, 2023. Pursuant to the NMG OH P1 Consent Agreement, the Agent and the Lender consented to the transaction contemplated in the Purchase Agreement, including the sales of the Interests, and has agreed to the provision or authorization of a UCC-3 Termination Statement and any applicable releases of all liens in favor of the Agent on the assets and equity of NMG OH P1 pursuant to the Loan Agreement, provided that certain conditions precedent and conditions subsequent are satisfied. The consent provided pursuant to the NMG OH P1 Consent Agreement is conditioned on the following conditions subsequent: (i) subject to the Exit Fee (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and applied Premium Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 105% upon any date the Purchase Price or any funds are owed or paid to DEP or any other Loan Party pursuant to the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement, the Loan Parties shall cause the Agent to directly receive a repayment in the amount of such proceeds paid directly by the Purchaser (inclusive of the Deposit) to be paid by the Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, in each case applied as a mandatory repayment of the Principal Balance (as defined in the Loan Agreement), and (ii) the Closing Date shall occur on or before September 1, 2024; provided that this consent shall be rescindable by the Agent in entirety if any Default (as defined in the Loan Agreement) occurs or is continuing after December 31, 2023.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement, the NMG OH P1 Side Agreement and the NMG OH P1 Consent Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement, the NMG OH P1 Side Agreement and the NMG OH P1 Consent Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 10.91, 10.92, 10.93 hereto, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.\nClosing of Equity Purchase Agreement (NMG OH 1)\nOn October 17, 2023 (the Closing Date), the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, DEP, NMG OH 1, and Farmaceutical closed the EPA, whereby DEP sold all of the issued and outstanding interests and other ownership, equity or profits interests in NMG OH 1 to Farmaceutical. Pursuant to the closing of the EPA, Farmaceutical paid an initial total consideration of $8.225 million ($7,975,000 on closing plus $250,000 deposit upon signing of the EPA) (the Initial Purchase Price) in cash to DEP, which Initial Purchase Price is subject to a working capital adjustment and other customary adjustments pursuant to Section 2.3 of the EPA to be calculated within 365 days of the Closing Date (the Final Purchase Price). Based on the Accepted Adjustment Statement (as defined in the EPA), the parties shall determine if the Final Purchaser Price shall be adjusted upwards or downwards. An amount equal to the Escrow Amount (as defined in the EPA) of $100,000 from the Final Purchase Price is being held in escrow and will be released to DEP on the fifth day of the twelfth month after the Closing Date unless there are any indemnification claims pending until such time as the claim is resolved.\nIn addition, DEP shall receive a payment of $2,500,000 (each, a Bonus Payment) for each additional dispensary license granted to NMG OH 1 by the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy or other regulatory body, in accordance with the terms of the EPA. Additional dispensary licenses that will receive the Bonus Payment shall specifically exclude an adult use license issued for the License (as defined in the EPA) and current lease location.\nFull Repayment of Senior Secured Loan\nPursuant to the closing of the EPA with respect to NMG OH 1, the Company used $7.34 million of the proceeds received from the sale of NMG OH 1 to fully repay the Lender all amounts owing under the Loan Agreement and the Term Note (as defined in the Loan Agreement).\nOur Products and Services\nWe cultivate and produce medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products such as cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name Body and Mind. We also produce products under license agreements and have license agreements. Our dispensary operations stock a wide variety of brands and form factors.\nWe have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis markets. The regulated medical and recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation. Accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctors recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. States have authorized numerous medical conditions as qualifying conditions for treatment with medical-use cannabis, including but not limited to treatment for cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, seizures, muscle spasms, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraines, arthritis, Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, lupus, residual limb pain, spinal cord injuries, inflammatory bowel disease and terminal illness.\nWe believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation and production of products within the medical and recreational use cannabis industry:\n\u00b7\nSignificant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth;\n\u00b7\nA shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis;\n\u00b7\nLimited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;\n\u00b7\nNMG currently has three main product lines: (i) flower, (ii) edibles, and (iii) extracts; and\n\u00b7\nNMG currently cultivates recreational marijuana.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.\nWe have a Nevada cannabis distribution license to distribute our products and our primary market is in the State of Nevada.\nOur Strategy\nBody and Minds strategy is focused on a platform approach to expansion which focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions. We work to maximize shareholder value through:\n1)\nProduction and distribution of Body and Mind branded products (production and/or cultivation);\n2)\nUse excess production capacity to produce and distribute synergistic third party brands;\n3)\nOwn or operate strategic retail stores; and\n4)\nEnter new markets though lower cost applications and opportunistic / targeted acquisitions.\nWe have a track record of award-winning cannabis strains, flower and extracts and as early entrants to the Nevada market management has experience with writing license applications, cultivating and operating efficiently and working within a highly regulated business environment.\nWe have developed the premium, marquis lifestyle Body and Mind brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles.\nWe have a long track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with licensing to manufacture for brands.\nNMG was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 3, 2014. NMG was an early applicant in Nevada in 2014 and was awarded one of the first state medical licenses for both cultivation and production of marijuana. NMG has been a licensed producer and cultivator of cannabis products since it was issued its first cultivation license on November 5, 2015 and production license on December 10, 2015. On July 1, 2017, NMG was awarded an additional state recreational cultivation and production license. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles, which are available for sale under the brand name Body & Mind in dispensaries in Nevada.\nNMG has several growth initiatives underway including new product introductions, product licensing, third party extraction, out-of-State licensing, acquisitions and divestments.\nSince our acquisition of NMG, as discussed in more detail above, we have been focused on:\n(1)\nimproving NMGs existing facility;\n(2)\nrefining product availability;\n(3)\nlowering production costs;\n(4)\nlicense application, and\n(5)\nacquisitions.\nIncreased Product Availability\nWe focused on flower and developing top end strains during the early years of our business. When Nevada was a medical only market we performed significant research on edibles with products including granola bars, beef jerky, hard candies and gummies. We also performed significant research on extraction with products ranging from shatter, rosin, distillate and raw oil.\nAs state legal medical and adult use rules have changed, we have focused on opportunities to grow into new states through licensing opportunities and acquisitions.\nWe continually work on research for new products and recipes.\nLowering Our Production Costs\nAs cannabis flower continues to be the foundation product for the marijuana industry, we are striving for continuous improvement to our cultivation process. Our aim will always focus on increasing the production yields of each harvest, and to obtain the highest quality product harvest. Doing so achieves two things for us and our customers: (1) allows us to maximize our profit; and (2) gives our customers the best value for their dollar by offering high quality THC products.\nEffect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) regulates all food and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce (with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products). At this time, our edible food products are not introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, and FDA approval of our edible products is not required. However, we must, and do, comply with food labeling requirements set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District (the SNHD) and the Nevada Department of Taxation, which include: a statement of identity, net quantity of contents, ingredient statement, manufacturer information, nutritional labeling, use-by date, safe handling instructions, an allergen statement, Keep out of reach of children statement, THIS IS A CANNABIS PRODUCT statement, cannabinoid profile, terpenoid profile, total amount of THC, our production license number, production run number, date of production, date of final testing, date on which the product was packaged, etc.\nOur operations as a licensed cultivator and producer of marijuana and marijuana products could be found in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act. Due to this, we may face higher federal income tax liability as it is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a cannabis company from deducting any expenses from their income on its federal income tax return, except for those considered to be cost of goods sold (COGS). While this severely impacts marijuana retailers, as opposed to cultivators and producers, we do face higher federal income tax liability than a non-cannabis company.\nThe State of Nevada, per Nevada Revised Statutes Section 372A.290, has implemented the following taxes on marijuana and marijuana products: (i) a fifteen percent (15%) excise tax on the wholesale sale which is paid by the cultivator and is calculated on the fair market value at wholesale set by the Department of Taxation, and (ii) a ten percent (10%) excise tax on the retail sale which is paid by the retail store. We are obligated to collect and remit the wholesale cultivation tax on all wholesale sales and file the appropriate tax returns on a monthly basis. We currently do not have retail operations in Nevada, and therefore are not required to collect and/or remit any retail taxes. All marijuana and marijuana products sold at retail must also pay and remit sales taxes at the applicable local sales tax level.\nPrincipal Products and Services\nWe cultivate and produce medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products such as cannabis flower, oil, extracts and edibles under the brand name Body and Mind.\nPrincipal Products\nFinished Flower Buds - Packaged flower buds sold by strain type. We sell our Flower in various packaged weights (1.0 Gram, 3.5 Gram, and by the pound being the most popular). Flower strains include GG4, Key Lime Pie, Mandarin Cookies, Donuts, Purple Punch, Sequoia Strawberry, Sin Mint Cookies, True Power and White Nightmare.\nPre-Rolled Joints - grinded flower buds rolled in joint paper by strain type.

Roughly 3 to 6 strains are available at any time and can include strains such as GG4, Key Lime Pie, Mandarin Cookies, Donuts, Purple Punch, Sequoia Strawberry, Sin Mint Cookies, True Power and White Nightmare.\nConcentrates (in various forms) - these are concentrates with various consistencies regarding their final form:\n\u00b7\nShatter - a glass like concentrate\n\u00b7\nSugar - a sugar/salt like concentrate\n\u00b7\nAmbrosia - a sugar/ salt like concentrate with terpenes added\n\u00b7\nBadder - a concentrate with a malleable texture\n\u00b7\nLive Resin Sugar - made from extracting material that was frozen immediately after harvesting\nDistribution Methods\nIn Nevada, we sell directly to licensed Nevada dispensaries.\nIn Ohio, we sell manufactured products directly to licensed Ohio dispensaries..\nIn Arkansas, we, through NMG, manage the BaM Body and Mind branded medical marijuana dispensary in West Memphis, Arkansas, which opened on April 27, 2020. Medical marijuana dispensaries in Arkansas allow limited cultivation and Body and Mind commenced operation of the cultivation facility in April 2021. The cultivation provides the BaM Body and Mind branded dispensary with cannabis.\nSources and availability of raw materials\nFinished Flower - In Nevada and Arkansas, our clones are all produced in-house from older batches of plants. Other clone sources are readily available to purchase throughout Nevada. Our coco growing medium (soil like material) is the only component of raw materials that is produced outside of our control. Coco suppliers are readily available in the event of a loss of our supplier. We produce our nutrients in-house using basic nutrients readily available in the cultivation market. Our packaging is produced locally and overseas, and suppliers are readily available.\nPre-Rolled Joints - In Nevada, our flower buds produce the material for our pre-rolls. All of our pre-roll packaging is easily obtained. There are numerous suppliers of joint paper, joint vials, and other joint packaging materials. Our packaging is produced overseas, and suppliers are readily available.\nConcentrates - our flower is used to produce our concentrates in Nevada. On Ohio we purchase trim and flower from licenses cultivators. All the chemicals, supplies, and equipment required to produce concentrates can be easily obtained.\nVape Cartridges - our flower and extraction process is used to produce the oil placed in vape cartridges. The vape cartridge and packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers and there are numerous suppliers that can meet our demand. The company does not use vitamin E acetate or any other artificial agent for thinning any cannabis oil products.\nDistillate Oil - our flower is used to produce distillate oil. The packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers. There are plenty of suppliers that can meet our demand. All chemicals required for the distillation are common and readily available for purchase.\nCompetitive business conditions\nSupply & Demand - as our competitors expand operations, there is more supply creating less demand for mid and low quality cannabis products. We continue to provide high quality products, excellent customer service, and competitive prices.\nWe have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis market. The regulated medical-recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, each market varies on a state-by-state basis.\nWe believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation, production and retail sales of products within the medical recreational-use cannabis industry:\n\u00b7\nIndustry and consumer growth in recent years and expected continued growth;\n\u00b7\nA shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis;\n\u00b7\nLimited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;\n\u00b7\nOpportunity for skilled operators to transfer operational and execution experience to new facilities and operations.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.\nWe have a distribution licence and infrastructure to distribute our products and our primary market is in State of Nevada.\nProduct Regulation\nState laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctors recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations.\nIn November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved cannabis use for adults over the age of 21 without a physicians prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations:\n\u00b7\nIn November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (the AUMA), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA.\n\u00b7\nNevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions.\nWe have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute cannabis in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California.\nArkansas voters approved medical use in 2017 and we have obtained the necessary approvals and licenses to carry out our management agreement with a licensee in the state of Arkansas.\nIn Illinois, we own and operate one licensed dispensary and are in the process of constructing another licensed dispensary that we are managing and have the ability to acquire through agreements.\nWith the recent acquisition of a NJ company that holds the rights to a NJ dispensary in a limited license jurisdiction. We plan to develop and operate a cannabis dispensary business in the near future.\nDespite the changes in state laws, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. The U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.\nWe are monitoring the current federal administrations, the DOJs and Congress positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Recently, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Governments approach to cannabis, including the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Law which enables research into marijuana-derived medications. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced.\nIt is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in certain states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada, California, Ohio, Michigan and Arkansas laws and regulations. However, any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business.\nFurther, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.\nCompetitive Conditions and Position\nProduction and Sales\nIn Nevada, NMG has a number of licenses and a long-term lease for a facility allowing it to cultivate, produce and distribute medical and recreational marijuana. In addition to flower products, we produce marijuana extract products such as distillate oil, shatter and edibles. In Ohio we have a processing license and produce Body and Mind branded distillate oil and edibles for the medical market. In Arkansas we manage a high quality craft flower cultivation in the same location as the Body and Mind dispensary. Our retail operations comprise of dispensaries in California, Illinois and Arkansas.\nThe Nevada, California, Illinois and Arkansas Markets\nWe face competition from a variety of competitors. Several factors impacting competition include, but are not limited to, wholesale pricing competition, the quality control and consistency of products being produced, the hiring and retention of competent personnel within the industry, brand marketing and production costs.\nThe United States Market\nWe face competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including, but not limited to, independent investors, hedge funds and other cannabis operators, all of whom may compete with us to acquire real estate zoned for medical-use and/or recreational-use cannabis facilities. The current market for medical and recreational marijuana products may be limited as more competitors enter the market.\nSee - Risk Factors - Risks related to the Business and Industry.\nIntellectual Property\nPatents and Trademarks\nWe currently have BaM trademarked in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio.

The certificate expires March 31, 2024. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified the following material risks and uncertainties which reflect our outlook and conditions known to us as of the date of this Annual Report. These material risks and uncertainties should be carefully reviewed by our stockholders and any potential investors in evaluating the Company, our business and the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, any one of these material risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause actual results, performance, achievements or events to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or events implied, suggested or expressed by any forward-looking statements made by us or by persons acting on our behalf. Refer to Forward-looking Statements.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any one or more of the following material risks and uncertainties may cause on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, which may result in a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these material risks and uncertainties represent a complete list of the material risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties of a material nature that, as of the date of this Annual Report, we are unaware of or that we consider immaterial that may become material in the future, any one or more of which may result in a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any one of these material risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to the Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history which may make it difficult for investors to predict future performance based on current operations.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors may base an evaluation of our potential future performance. Our subsidiary, NMG was formed on March 3, 2014 and began carrying on business in the same year, and therefore, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources and lack of revenues.\nWe have incurred losses in prior periods, and losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our Common Shares to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due and on our cash flow.\nWe have incurred losses in prior periods. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, we incurred a comprehensive loss of $20,307,880 and, as of that date, we had an accumulated deficit of $66,829,507. Any losses in the future could cause the quoted price of our Common Shares on the CSE to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to pay our debts as they become due, and on our cash flow.\nWe are a holding company and investors are subject to the risks attributable to our subsidiaries which generate substantially all of our revenues.\nWe are a holding company and essentially all of our operating assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result, investors in us are subject to the risks attributable to our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we conduct our business through our subsidiaries, which generate substantially all of our revenues. Consequently, our cash flows and ability to complete current or desirable future enhancement opportunities are dependent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and regulations which require that solvency and capital standards be maintained by such companies and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness and trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of ingestible products, we face exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if products are alleged to have caused harm.\nWe face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if our products are alleged to have caused significant loss or injury. In addition, the manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of our products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. We may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that its products caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against us could result in increased costs, could adversely affect our reputation with our clients and consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our potential products.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products, we face exposure to product recalls or return of products.\nWe may be subject to the recall or return of our products for reasons such as, product defects, contamination, unintended harmful side effects, interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of our products are recalled, we could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. We may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. There can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of our significant brands were subject to recall, the image of the brand and Body and Mind could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of our regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our operations remains uncertain, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and on the market price of our common shares.\nIn December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (now commonly known as COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread rapidly throughout many countries, and, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. COVID-19 may have a future material impact on our results of operation with respect to retail sales at our dispensary locations as well as wholesales of our products in Nevada to dispensaries in Nevada. In Nevada, the state forced all in-store sales to be halted in March 2020, only allowing home delivery sales, and eventually curbside pickup sales. This order forced the retail market and the wholesale demand to nearly stop until retailers satisfied regulatory requirements to carry out home delivery and curbside pickup. This had a significant negative impact on our sales from March 2020 to May 2020 in Nevada. Although certain COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed, significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of our common shares.\nOur future success depends on our key executive officers and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management, particularly the Chief Executive Officer who consults to us. Certain members of our senior management team are generally contracted on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time with little or short notice. The loss of the services of our senior management, the CEO, or other key employees/contractors for any reason could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel will also be critical to our success because of the need to hire and retain additional personnel as business grows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. Because of these factors, we may not be able to effectively manage or grow our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe and/or our subsidiaries may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our respective businesses which could adversely affect our respective operations. Should any litigation in which we and/or our subsidiaries become involved be determined against us and/or our subsidiaries, such a decision may adversely affect our respective abilities to continue operating, adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares and use significant resources. Even if we and/or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, is involved in litigation and succeeds, litigation can redirect significant company resources. In addition, litigation may also create a negative perception of our brand.\nOur intended growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nOur growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operates in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, if our business demand depends on customers spending budgets, product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.\nWe face intense competition and our competitors may have a longer operating history or greater financial resources allowing them to compete more effectively.\nWe may face intense competition from other companies, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than us. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe State of Nevada, as well as the states of Ohio, Illinois and New Jersey, have only issued to date a small number of licenses to produce and sell medical marijuana. There were, however, many applicants for licenses. Because of early stages of the industry in which we operate, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. If the number of users of medical marijuana in the United States increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with environmental and safety laws may result in us incurring additional costs for corrective measures.\nMedical and adult use cannabis operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions and discharges to water, air and land, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, and employee health and safety. Our failure to comply with environmental and safety laws and regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or in restrictions in manufacturing operations. In addition, changes in environmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur cannabis crop could be harmed by pests, plant diseases or other agricultural risks which would have a material adverse affect on our business.\nOur business involves the growing of cannabis, which is an agricultural product. As such, our business is subject to the risks inherent in the agricultural business, such as pests, plant diseases and similar agricultural risks. This could lead to a reduced yield when harvesting the cannabis affecting the supply of cannabis for distribution, and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our ability to meet consumer demand.\nWe may experience increased costs during the growth stage of the cannabis due to the possibility of rising energy costs.\nGrowing cannabis requires a considerable amount of energy. We are vulnerable to rising costs of energy due to our need to consume considerable amounts of energy to grow our product. Rising or volatile energy costs may adversely impact our business by increasing production costs and decreasing revenue if those increased costs cannot be transferred to the consumer.\nThe cannabis industry is difficult to forecast due to the industry being in the early growth stages.\nDetailed sales forecasts are not generally obtainable from sources at this early stage of the medical marijuana industry in the United States. A failure in the demand for products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur public image and the consumer perception of us is greatly influenced by scientific research, regulatory investigations, and media attention. Negative publicity will result in an unfavorable public image and will negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe the medical marijuana industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the medical marijuana produced. Consumer perception of our products and proposed products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical marijuana products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical marijuana market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity.\nOur dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse reports, findings, attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on us, the demand for our products and proposed products, and our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical marijuana in general, or our products and proposed products specifically, or associating the consumption of medical marijuana with illness or other negative effects or events, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed.\nRisks related to the Federal and State Regulations\nFederal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of cannabis laws and regulations may negatively impact our results of operations.\nCannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (the CSA). Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical cannabis has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis remains a violation of federal law. Federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis pre-empts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal or adult-retail purposes, and therefore strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would severely restrict our ability to carry out our business plan.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice under the Obama administration had issued memoranda, including the so-called Cole Memorandum on August 29, 2013, characterizing enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions under the CSA to prosecute those complying with state regulatory systems allowing the use, manufacture and distribution of medical cannabis as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial resources when state regulatory and enforcement efforts are effective with respect to enumerated federal enforcement priorities under the CSA. In the Cole Memorandum, the U.S. Department of Justice provided guidance to all federal prosecutors indicating that federal enforcement of the CSA against cannabis-related conduct should be focused on eight priorities, which are to prevent: (1) distribution of cannabis to minors; (2) revenue from sale of cannabis to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; (3) transfer of cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is illegal; (4) cannabis activity from being a pretext for trafficking of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; (5) violence or use of firearms in cannabis cultivation and distribution; (6) drugged driving and adverse public health consequences from cannabis use; (7) growth of cannabis on federal lands; and (8) cannabis possession or use on federal property.\nOn January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo updating the Department of Justices policy on federal marijuana enforcement (the Sessions Memorandum). The Sessions Memorandum effectively rescinded and replaced the Cole Memorandum, and directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. While in theory the protections under the Cole Memorandum have been abolished, the new policy does not explicitly direct local U.S. Attorneys to launch an attack on state-legal marijuana businesses. Rather, the new policy promulgated by the Sessions Memorandum is to return local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs. The threat of federal prosecution remains for legitimate, state-legal marijuana businesses, including our business.\nHowever, no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where we operate will agree that our activities within such prosecutors district do not go contrary to the Justice Departments goals. There is also no guarantee that the current administration or future administrations will not revise the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memorandum, the Sessions Memorandum or otherwise choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis production or distribution.\nOn April 11, 2018, U.S. Senator Cory Gardner received assurances from former President Donald Trump that 1) states with legal marijuana industries would not be targeted by the Justice Department, 2) the rescission of the Cole Memorandum would not impact states legal marijuana industries, and 3) that the former President would support a federalism-based legislative solution to fix the states rights issue once and for all. The former Presidents comments are encouraging to legal marijuana businesses; however, no legislative action at the federal level has been taken.\nUnder U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide us with banking services could be found guilty of money laundering, which restricts our ability to receive reputable banking services and adversely affects our business operations.\nUnder U.S. federal law it may potentially be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from marijuana sales or any other Schedule I substance. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy. Financial institutions must submit a suspicious activity report (SAR) as required by federal money laundering laws. These marijuana related SARs are divided into three categories: marijuana limited, marijuana priority, and marijuana terminated, based on the financial institutions belief that the marijuana business follows state law, is operating out of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated. There can be no assurance that a negative SAR will not be filed against us limiting our access to banking services as well as subjecting us to Federal review. This will also negatively impact our public image and affect operations.\nRisks related to Our Securities\nWe may issue additional Common Shares in the future, which could cause significant dilution to all shareholders.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 900,000,000 Common Shares, with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of October 27, 2023, the Company had 146,636,974 Common Shares issued and outstanding, 7,553,000 stock options outstanding and 36,415,284 share purchase warrants outstanding, of which 3,200,000 share purchase warrants were held in escrow.\nAs at July 31, 2023, the Companys 17,151,000 stock options outstanding of which only 12,989,000 stock options are exercisable into 12,989,000 Common Shares of the Company with the following terms:\nNumber of options outstanding\nExercise price\nExpiry dates\n775,000\nCAD$0.57\n10 December 2023\n1,600,000\nCAD$0.88\n21 August 2024\n250,000\nCAD$0.93\n1 October 2024\n200,000\nCAD$0.88\n23 January 2025\n250,000\nCAD$0.405\n1 March 2025\n1,375,000\nCAD$0.67\n30 April 2025\n350,000\nCAD$0.88\n21 August 2024\n150,000\nCAD$0.61\n10 December 2023\n80,000\nCAD$0.57\n10 December 2023\n1,250,000\nCAD$0.68\n6 March 2026\n250,000\nCAD$0.65\n5 April 2024\n448,000\nCAD$0.44\n30 November 2026\n200,000\nCAD$0.44\n30 November 2024\n200,000\nCAD$0.15\n8 July 2027\n4,050,000\nCAD$0.065\n25 April 2028\n5,723,000\nCAD$0.065\n25 April 2028\n17,151,000\nNumber of options exercisable\nExercise price\nExpiry dates\n775,000\nCAD$0.57\n10 December 2023\n1,600,000\nCAD$0.88\n21 August 2024\n250,000\nCAD$0.93\n1 October 2024\n200,000\nCAD$0.88\n23 January 2025\n250,000\nCAD$0.405\n1 March 2025\n1,375,000\nCAD$0.67\n30 April 2025\n350,000\nCAD$0.88\n21 August 2024\n150,000\nCAD$0.61\n10 December 2023\n80,000\nCAD$0.57\n10 December 2023\n1,250,000\nCAD$0.68\n6 March 2026\n250,000\nCAD$0.65\n5 April 2024\n336,000\nCAD$0.44\n30 November 2026\n200,000\nCAD$0.44\n30 November 2024\n200,000\nCAD$0.15\n8 July 2027\n5,723,000\nCAD$0.065\n25 April 2028\n12,989,000\nAs at July 31, 2023, the Companys 20,800,000 share purchase warrants outstanding are exercisable into 20,800,000 Common Shares of the Company with the following terms:\nNumber of warrants\noutstanding and exercisable\nExercise price\nExpiry dates\n4,800,000\nUSD$0.40\n19 July 2025\n15,000,000\nUSD$0.10\n19 December 2026\n1,000,000\nUSD$0.16\n14 June 2027\n20,800,000(1)\nCAD$0.27\n(1)\nThis figure does not include 3,200,000 warrants issued to the Agent pursuant to the Loan Agreement, which warrants are held in escrow by us and are to be released to the Agent if we draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan by March 31, 2023, or cancelled if we do not draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan. Each warrant, if released to the Agent, will entitle the holder to acquire one share of common stock at an exercise price of US$0.45 per share until July 19, 2025.\nWe may issue additional Common Shares in the future in connection with a financing or an acquisition. Such issuances may not require the approval of our shareholders. Any issuance of additional shares of our Common Shares, or equity securities convertible into our Common Shares, including but not limited to, warrants and options, will dilute the percentage ownership interest of all shareholders, may dilute the book value per share of our Common Shares, and may negatively impact the market price of our Common Shares.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Common Shares, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Shares in the foreseeable future. Declaring and paying future dividends, if any, will be determined by our Board, based upon earnings, financial condition, capital resources, capital requirements, restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation, contractual restrictions, and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. Unless we pay dividends, our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. There is no assurance that shareholders will be able to sell shares when desired.\nOur Common Shares are categorized as penny stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to buy and sell our Common Shares due to suitability requirements.\nOur Common Shares are considered penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The price of our Common Shares is significantly less than $5.00 per share. This designation imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer buying securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities given the increased risks generally inherent in penny stocks. These rules may restrict the ability and/or willingness of brokers or dealers to buy or sell our Common Shares, either directly or on behalf of their clients, may discourage potential stockholders from purchasing our Common Shares, or may adversely affect the ability of stockholders to sell their shares.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholders ability to buy and sell our Common Shares, which could depress the price of our Common Shares.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer before recommending an investment to a customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, the FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our Common Shares, have an adverse effect on the market for our Common Shares, and thereby depress our price per Common Share.

Refer to Forward-looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIntroduction\nThe following discussion summarizes the results of operations for each of our fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 and our financial condition as at July 31, 2023 and 2022, with a particular emphasis on fiscal 2023, our most recently completed fiscal year.\nOverview\nOur business is the production and cultivation of medical and recreational marijuana in Nevada pursuant to licenses held by NMG operating under the marquee brand name of Body & Mind and produces flower, oil, extracts and edibles and are available for sale in dispensaries in Nevada. In addition, we have retail / dispensary operations in California, Illinois and Arkansas, and wholesale operations in Ohio and Arkansas that produce flower and/or concentrates from extraction. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, we had retail/dispensary operations in Ohio and Michigan, however, those dispensaries have now been sold.\nResults of Operations for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022:\nJuly 31,\n$\nJuly 31,\n$\nSales\n22,819,983\n23,372,823\nCost of sales and other\n(17,044,221 )\n(15,925,892 )\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n(13,445,701\n)\n(11,958,933 )\nOther Items\n(10,484,265 )\n22,128,743\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\n(20,322,690\n)\n(29,159,677 )\nNet Loss\n(20,566,354\n)\n(28,228,104 )\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustment\n258,474\n96,380\nComprehensive Loss\n(20,307,880\n)\n(28,131,724 )\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share - Continuing Operations\n(0.15 )\n(0.26 )\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share - Discontinued Operations\n(0.00 )\n(0.25 )\nRevenues and Cost of Sales\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, we had total sales of $22,819,983 and cost of sales of $17,044,221 for a gross margin of $5,775,762 compared to total sales of $23,372,823 and cost of sales of $15,925,892 for a gross margin of $7,446,931 in the year ended July 31, 2022. Sales remained relatively the same, with only a 2% decrease for 2023, but the cost of sales increased by 7% compared to 2022 largely due to the Nevada inventory adjustment recognized during fiscal 2023. During the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company recorded product sales as follows:\nRevenues - By Segment\nYear ended July 31, 2023\n$\n%\nWholesale\n5,070,441\n22 %\nRetail\n17,749,542\n78 %\nTotal\n22,819,983\nRevenues - By Segment\nYear ended July 31, 2022\n$\n%\nWholesale\n5,250,972\n22 %\nRetail\n18,121,851\n78 %\nTotal\n23,372,823\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses totaled $13,445,701 compared with $11,958,933 for the year ended July 31, 2022. A significant reason for the increase in general and administrative expenses between the years related to increased depreciation from $1,062,797 to $1,114,508, license, utilities and office administration from $3,570,351 to $4,007,588, business development expense from $669,471 to $835,326 and accounting and legal fees from $845,386 to $1,315,666 as a result of various ongoing acquisitions, expansions and sale of the Michigan and Ohio operations. Lease expense increased from $691,321 to $1,283,987 mainly as a result of additional leased premises in New Jersey and Illinois.\nIncome Taxes\nThe (benefit) expense for income taxes consists of the following:\nCurrent:\nFederal\n2,588,522\n$ 1,540,516\nState\n7,471\n61,153\n2,595,993\n1,601,669\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(427,507 )\n4,787\nState\n-\n168,153\n(427,507 )\n172,940\nTotal (benefit) expense for income taxes\n2,168,486\n$ 1,774,609\nSection 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) prohibits businesses engaged in the trafficking of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances from deducting normal business expenses, such as payroll and rent, from gross income (revenue less cost of goods sold). Section 280E was originally intended to penalize criminal market operators, but because cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance for U.S. Federal purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has subsequently applied Section 280E to state-legal cannabis businesses. Cannabis businesses operating in states that align their tax codes with the IRC are also unable to deduct normal business expenses from their state taxes. The nondeductible expenses shown in the effective rate reconciliation above is comprised primarily of the impact of applying Section 280E to the Companys businesses that are involved in selling cannabis, along with other typical non-deductible expenses such as lobbying expenses.\nNet loss for the year before income tax\n$ (18,154,204 )\n$ (26,640,745 )\nFederal and state income tax rates\n21.00 %\n21.00 %\nExpected income tax recovery\n(3,806,994 )\n(5,594,555 )\nState taxes\n(615,593 )\n(474,933 )\nStock options\n-\n118,816\nIRC 280E disallowance\n4,318,695\n7,648,632\nDeferred tax adjustment\n(757,256 )\n(585,809 )\nReturn to provision\n(1,543,140 )\n-\nValuation allowance\n968,717\n724,287\nChange in State tax rate\n(186,076 )\n-\nUncertain tax position\n3,790,133\n-\nOther\n-\n(61,829 )\nTotal income tax expense\n$ 2,168,486\n$ 1,774,609\nThe impact of the loss on impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, ROU assets, and loans receivable in the aggregate amount of $9,370,092 is included in the IRC 280E disallowance for 2023. Approximately $19 million was included in the IRC 280E disallowance for the year ended 31 July 2023 related to the impairment losses.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, our other income and expenses accounted for $10,484,265 in expenses as compared to $22,128,743 in expenses for the year ended July 31, 2023. The significant components in other items primarily relates to the Companys impairment loss on brand, licenses, property and equipment and right-of-use assets in Nevada and Long Beach for a combined total of $9,370,092. In 2022, the Company also recognized impairment loss on brand, licenses, goodwill and right-of-use assets in Manistee, Michigan for a combined total of $20,517,192.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended July 31, 2023 totaled $20,566,354 compared with a net loss of $28,228,104 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The decrease in net loss of $7,661,750 is largely due to the impairment loss on right-of-use assets, brand, licenses and goodwill totaling $20,517,192 in the comparative year and offset mainly as a result of the increase in operating expenses as discussed above.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nWe recorded translation adjustments gain of $258,474 and $96,380 for the year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amounts are included in the statement of operations as other comprehensive income (loss) for the respective years.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table sets out our cash and working capital as of July 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of\nJuly 31,\nAs of\nJuly 31,\nCash reserves\n$ 1,511,051\n$ 1,469,099\nWorking capital (deficiency)\n$ 1,606,967\n$ 5,669,884\nFinancings\nThere has been no equity financing during the year ended July 31, 2023.

COVID-19 has since spread rapidly throughout many countries, and, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, and there have been business closures and a substantial reduction in economic activity in countries that have had significant outbreaks of COVID-19. Although certain restrictions have been relaxed, COVID-19 may have a future material impact on our results of operation with respect to retail sales at our dispensary locations as well as wholesales of our products in Nevada to dispensaries in Nevada. Significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, and on the global economy as a whole. It is currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact on our business or our operations, however, we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely, and intend to follow health and safety guidelines as they evolve.\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nOutstanding share data\nAt November 10, 2023, we had 146,636,974 issued and outstanding common shares, 17,151,000 outstanding stock options and 20,800,000 outstanding warrants.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, managements estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\u00b7\nIncome taxes\nThe determination of deferred income tax assets or liabilities requires subjective assumptions regarding future income tax rates and the likelihood of utilizing tax carry-forwards. Changes in these assumptions could materially affect the recorded amounts, and therefore do not necessarily provide certainty as to their recorded values.\n\u00b7\nForeign currency\nThe Company determines the functional currency through an analysis of several indicators such as expenses and cash flows, financing activities, retention of operating cash flows, and frequency of transactions with the reporting entity.\n\u00b7\nFair value of financial instruments\nManagement uses valuation techniques, in measuring the fair value of financial instruments, where active market quotes are not available.\nIn applying the valuation techniques, management makes maximum use of market inputs wherever possible, and uses estimates and assumptions that are, as far as possible, consistent with observable data that market participants would use in pricing the instrument. Where applicable data is not observable, management uses its best estimate about the assumptions that market participants would make. Such estimates include liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility may vary from the actual results that would be achieved in an arms length transaction at the reporting date. The assessment of the timing and extent of impairment of intangible assets involves both significant judgements by management about the current and future prospects for the intangible assets as well as estimates about the factors used to quantify the extent of any impairment that is recognized.\n\u00b7\nLong-lived assets and goodwill\nLong-lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually. When there are indications of impairment, the Company calculates the fair value of reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of the asset groups for long-lived assets using various valuation techniques, which require the input of highly subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimate.\n\u00b7\nIntellectual property\nThe recoverability of the carrying value of the intellectual property is dependent on numerous factors. The carrying value of these assets is reviewed by management when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recovered. If impairment is determined to exist, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.\n\u00b7\nStock-based compensation\nThe option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, and therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Companys stock options.\n\u00b7\nBusiness Combination\nThe results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. Purchase accounting results in assets and liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.\nWe perform valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination in order to record the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimate of fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. Significant estimation is required in determining the fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities. The significant estimation is primarily due to the judgmental nature of the inputs to the valuation models used to measure the fair value of these intangible assets, deferred revenue and contingent consideration liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying significant assumptions. We use the income approach to measure the fair value of these intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included forecasted revenues from existing customers and existing customer attrition rates. When estimating the significant assumptions to be used in the valuation we include a consideration of current industry information, market and economic trends, historical results of the acquired business and other relevant factors. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage the assistance of valuation specialists in concluding on fair value measurements in connection with determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2021-08 requires the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Considerations to determine the amount of contract assets and contract liabilities to record at the acquisition date include the terms of the acquired contract, such as timing of payment, identification of each performance obligation in the contract and allocation of the contract transaction price to each identified performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis as of contract inception. ASU 2021-08 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2023. ASU 2021-08 should be applied prospectively for acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption of the proposed amendments would be permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nManagement of financial risks\nThe financial risk arising from the Companys operations are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.\nThese risks arise from the normal course of operations and all transactions undertaken are to support the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The risks associated with these financial instruments and the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below. Management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner.\n\u00b7\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by maintaining its cash with major financial institutions. Credit risk associated with the convertible loans receivable arises from the possibility that the principal and/or interest due may become uncollectible. The Company mitigates this risk by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship. The Company is not currently exposed to any significant credit risk associated with its trade receivable.\n\u00b7\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company had working capital of $1,606,967 as at July 31, 2023. The Company outlined substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern in prior periods which has been alleviated by securing long term debt, cash flow positive operations and increased sales. The Company anticipates that current cashflow positive operations, cash on hand and working capital will ensure coverage for all expenses associated with current operations for at least the next 15 months from the issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt or equity securities to further contribute to the growth of the company.\n\u00b7\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as it does not hold financial instruments that will fluctuate in value due to changes in market interest rates.\n\u00b7\nCurrency risk\nCurrency risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because they are denominated in currencies that differ from the respective functional currency. The Company is exposed to currency risk by incurring expenditures and holding assets denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. Assuming all other variables remain constant, a 1% change in the Canadian dollar against the US dollar would not result in a significant change to the Companys operations.\n\u00b7\nOther risks\nThe Company is not exposed to other risks unless otherwise noted. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nBODY AND MIND INC.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the years ended 31 July 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in U.S. Dollars)\nBODY AND MIND INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB Firm ID 3627)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Body and Mind Inc.:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Body and Mind Inc. (the Company) as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nDescription of the Critical Auditing Matter\nThe Company has various long-lived assets including definite lived intangible assets (Note 10), property and equipment (Note 8) and operating lease right of use assets (Note 13). Further, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing for its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Due to challenging industry and economic conditions, the Company tested two long lived asset groups (NMG and NMG LB) during the year ended July 31, 2023, for recoverability and ultimately to measure impairment. At the time of impairment review, the carrying values of NMG and NMG LB were approximately $4.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\nThe Companys evaluation of the recoverability of these long-lived asset groups involved comparing the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these long-lived asset groups to its their respective carrying amounts. The Companys measurement of impairment involved determining the fair value of certain long-lived asset groups primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model. The Companys recoverability and impairment analysis requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted sales growth rates and cash flows over the remaining useful life of these long-lived asset groups. The Company utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the recoverability of, and fair value of these long-lived asset groups.\nWe identified the testing and evaluation of the recoverability and impairment analysis as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the following:\n\u00b7\nTesting managements process for developing the tests for recoverability and fair value models.\n\u00b7\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the undiscounted and discounted cash flow models used by management.\n\u00b7\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the cash flow models.\n\u00b7\nEvaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including assumptions related to revenues, gross margin, other operating expenses and income taxes to discern whether they are reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the entity; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\u00b7\nProfessionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the evaluation of the undiscounted cash flow model and underlying assumptions.\n/s/ Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nDraper, UT\nNovember 13, 2023\nStatement 1\nBody and Mind Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(U.S. Dollars)\nASSETS\nAs of\n31 July 2023\nAs of\n31 July 2022\nCurrent\nCash\n$ 1,511,051\n$ 1,469,099\nAccounts receivable, net\n591,291\n438,839\nInterest receivable on convertible loan (Note 6)\n294,000\n222,000\nPrepaids\n542,400\n558,135\nInventory (Note 5)\n2,310,601\n3,565,431\nLoan receivable (Note 7)\n-\n789,984\nAssets held for sale -

(the Company) was incorporated on 5 November 1998 in the State of Delaware, USA, under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, the Company acquired 100% of Vocalscape, Inc. and changed its name to Vocalscape, Inc. On October 28, 2005, the Company changed its name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc. On October 23, 2008, the Company changed its name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (Deploy Tech) and, on September 15, 2010, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (Deploy) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, the Company merged with and into Deploy under the laws of the State of Nevada. Deploy, as the surviving corporation of the merger, assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech, and we were effectively re-domiciled in the State of Nevada. Upon the completion of the merger, Deploy assumed the name Deploy Technologies Inc., and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploys issued and outstanding common stock.\nOn 14 November 2017, the Company acquired Nevada Medical Group, LLC (NMG) and changed its name to Body and Mind Inc. The Company is now a supplier and grower of medical and recreational cannabis in the state of Nevada, and has retail operations in California, Ohio, and Arkansas.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as follows:\nName\nJurisdiction\nOwnership\nDate of acquisition or formation\nDEP Nevada Inc.

ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after 15 December 2022. The Company does not anticipate this amendment to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.\n3.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of presentation\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is 31 July.\nAccounts receivable\nAmounts receivable represents amounts owed from customers for sale of medical and recreational cannabis and sales tax recoverable. Amounts are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and current economic conditions. The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. As of 31 July 2023 and 2022, the Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when our customers obtain control of our products. This determination is based on the customer specific terms of the arrangement for wholesale operations. Upon transfer of control, the Company has no further performance obligations. All retail sales are considered cash on delivery.\nDue to the nature of the Companys revenue from contracts with customers, the Company does not have material contract assets or liabilities that fall under the scope of ASC 606.\nThe Companys revenues accounted for under ASC 606, generally, do not require significant estimates or judgments based on the nature of the Companys revenue streams. The sales prices are generally fixed and all consideration from contracts is included in the transaction price. The Companys contracts do not include multiple performance obligations or material variable consideration.\nSee Note 15 for revenue disaggregation table.\nInventory and cost of goods sold\nInventory consists of work in progress (live plants and plants in the drying process), finished goods, and consumables. The Company values its finished goods and consumables at the lower of the actual costs or its current estimated market value less costs to sell. The Company values its work in progress at cost using the average cost method.\nCosts incurred during the growing and production process are capitalized as incurred to the extent that cost is less than net realizable value. These costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead used in the growing and production processes. The Company capitalizes pre-harvest costs.\nThe Company periodically reviews its inventory for obsolete and potentially impaired items. Any identified slow moving and obsolete items are written down to its net realizable value through a charge to cost of goods sold. As of 31 July 2023 and 2022, the Company has no allowance for inventory obsolescence.\nCost of goods sold includes the costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid for finished goods, such as flower, edibles and concentrates, packaging and other supplies, fees for services and processing, and allocated overhead, such as allocations of rent, administrative salaries, utilities and related costs.\nLoans receivable\nThe Company carries its loans receivable at cost and are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:\nOffice equipment\n7 years\nCultivation equipment\n7 years\nProduction equipment\n7 years\nKitchen equipment\n7 years\nVehicles\n7 years\nVault equipment\n7 years\nLeasehold improvements\nshorter of useful life or the term of the lease\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired from third parties are measured initially at fair value and either classified as indefinite life or finite life depending on their characteristics. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually. The Companys brands and licenses acquired from NMG have indefinite lives; therefore, no amortization is recognized. The Companys brands and licenses acquired by NMG SD have a finite life of 10 years, brands and licenses acquired by NMG LB and NMG OH 1 have a finite life of 10 years, customer relationships acquired by NMG OH 1 have a finite life of five years, licenses acquired by Canopy have a finite life of 10 years and are amortized over these estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Brands acquired by Canopy have indefinite lives.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and definite life intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.\nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying amount in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The Company performs an impairment test annually by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets or reporting unit (for goodwill) with its carrying amount. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the consolidated financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.\nThe Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Recognition or measurement is reflected in the period in which the likelihood changes. Any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax liabilities are presented within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of 31 July 2023, potential common shares are comprised of 17,151,000 outstanding options, 33,215,284 outstanding warrants and 31,472,877 shares issuable on conversion of convertible debentures.\nComprehensive loss\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income/loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. As of 31 July 2023 and 2022, the Company reported foreign currency translation adjustments as other comprehensive income or loss and included a schedule of comprehensive income/loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nForeign currency translation\nThe Companys functional currency is the Canadian dollar and its reporting currency is in U.S. dollars. The Companys subsidiaries have a functional currency in U.S. dollars. The consolidated financial statements of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Exchange gains and losses on inter-company balances that form part of the net investment in foreign operations are included in other comprehensive income. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The exchange rates used to translate Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar was 0.7589 for monetary assets and liabilities and 0.7455 as an average rate for transactions occurred during the year ended 31 July 2023. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of net loss.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. The Companys accounting policy is to recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\u00b7\nLevel 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies.\n\u00b7\nLevel 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in other private entities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nThe Company measures equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\nThe convertible loan receivable was valued using Level 3 inputs.\nOther current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nUse of estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLease accounting\nUnder ASC 842, leases are separated into two classifications: operating leases and financial leases. Lease classification under ASC 842 is relatively similar to ASC 840. For a lease to be classified as a finance lease, it must meet one of the five finance lease criteria: (1) transference of title/ownership to the lessee, (2) purchase option, (3) lease term for major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, (4) present value represents substantially all of the fair value of the asset, and (5) asset specialization. Any lease that does not meet these criteria is classified as an operating lease. ASC 842 requires all leases to be recognized on the Companys balance sheet. Specifically, for operating leases, the Company recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability upon lease commitment.\nNon-controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) represent equity interests owned by outside parties. NCI may be initially measured at fair value or at the NCIs proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The Company has elected to measure each NCI at its proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquirees identifiable net assets. The share of net assets attributable to NCI are presented as a component of equity. NCI's share of net income or loss is recognized directly in equity. Total income or loss of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the Company and to the NCI, even if this results in the NCI having a deficit balance.\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\nThe Company classifies assets held for sale in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. When the Company makes the decision to sell an asset or to stop some part of its business, the Company assesses if such assets should be classified as an asset held for sale. To classify as an asset held for sale, the asset or disposal group must meet all of the following conditions: i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset, ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject to certain customary terms, iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated, iv) the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year, subject to certain exceptions, v) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value, and vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that the plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS). FVLCTS is the amount obtainable from the sale of the asset in an arms length transaction, less the costs of disposal. Once classified as held for sale, any depreciation and amortization on an asset cease to be recorded. For long-lived assets or disposals groups that are classified as held for sale but do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations, the assets and liabilities are presented separately on the balance sheet of the initial period in which it is classified as held for sale. The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n4.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe following table represents the Companys assets that are measured at fair value as of 31 July 2023 and 2022:\nAs of 31 July\nAs of 31 July\nFinancial assets at fair value\nCash\n$ 1,511,051\n$ 1,854,277\nConvertible loan receivable\n1,700,411\n1,250,000\nTotal financial assets at fair value\n$ 3,211,462\n$ 3,104,277\nManagement of financial risks\nThe financial risk arising from the Companys operations include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. These risks arise from the normal course of operations and all transactions undertaken are to support the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The risks associated with these financial instruments and the policies on how to mitigate these risks are set out below. Management manages and monitors these exposures to ensure appropriate measures are implemented on a timely and effective manner.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company reduces its exposure to credit risk by maintaining its cash with major financial institutions. Credit risk associated with the convertible loans receivable arises from the possibility that the principal and/or interest due may become uncollectible. The Company mitigates this risk by managing and monitoring the underlying business relationship.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company ensures, as far as reasonably possible, that it will have sufficient capital in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and the Companys holdings of cash. The Company had working capital of $1,606,967 at 31 July 2023, however, the Company had recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations, and the Company required additional financing to meet all current and future financial obligations which caused substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The Company anticipates that cash on hand and working capital will ensure coverage for all expenses associated with current operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt or equity securities to further contribute to the growth.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as it does not hold financial instruments that will fluctuate in value due to changes in interest rates.\nCurrency risk\nCurrency risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because they are denominated in currencies that differ from the respective functional currency. The Company is exposed to currency risk by incurring expenditures and holding assets denominated in currencies other than its functional currency.\n5.\nInventory\n31 July 2023\n31 July 2022\nWork in progress\n$ 652,825\n$ 610,030\nFinished goods\n604,519\n1,961,244\nConsumables\n1,053,257\n1,308,726\nTotal\n$ 2,310,601\n$ 3,880,000\n6.\nConvertible loan receivable\nEffective March 15, 2019, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, DEP Nevada and NMG, entered into a convertible loan agreement and a management agreement with Comprehensive Care Group LLC (CCG), an Arkansas limited liability company, with respect to the development of a medical cannabis dispensary facility in West Memphis, Arkansas. The convertible loan agreement can be extended by either party and the current agreement has a maturity date of 30 March 2024. Under no circumstances the maturity date of the convertible loan agreement shall extend beyond the expiration of the management agreement as described below.\nPursuant to the management agreement, NMG will provide operations and management services, including management, staffing, operations, administration, oversight, and other related services. Under the management agreement, NMG will be required to obtain approval from CCG for any key decisions as defined in the agreement and accordingly the Company does not control CCG. NMG will be paid a monthly management fee equal to 66.67% of the monthly net profits of CCG, subject to conversion of the convertible loan as discussed below upon which the monthly management fee shall be $6,000 per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The management agreement has an expiration of 15 March 2024 and can be mutually extendable.\nThe convertible loan agreement is for an amount up to $1,250,000 from DEP to CCG with proceeds to be used to fund construction of a facility, working capital and initial operating expenses. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of $6,000 per month until the parties mutually agree to increase the interest. Upon the latter of one year of granting of a medical cannabis dispensary license by the appropriate authorities or one year after entering into the convertible loan agreement, DEP may elect to convert the loan into preferred units of CCG equal to 40% of all outstanding preferred units of CCG that carry 66.7% voting interest, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission.\nThe Company had advanced $1,250,000 (2022 - $1,250,000) at 31 July 2023, and accrued interest income of $72,000 (2022 - $72,000) and for year ended 31 July 2023, respectively. As of 31 July 2023, total interest receivable was $294,000 (2022 - $222,000).\nThe Company evaluated the convertible loan receivables settlement provisions and elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825 Financial Instruments, to value this instrument. Under such election, the loan receivable is measured initially and subsequently at fair value, with any changes in the fair value of the instrument being recorded in the consolidated financial statements as a change in fair value of the financial instruments. The Company estimates the fair value of this instrument by first estimating the fair value of the straight debt portion, excluding the embedded conversion option, using a discounted cash flow model. The Company then estimates the fair value of the embedded conversion option using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.\nThe discounted cash flow model for the straight debt portion uses four different scenarios as follows: The Company discounts the principal amount of $1,250,000, monthly interest payment of $6,000 using these four different maturity dates: (1) March 30, 2024, (2) March 30, 2025, (3) March 30, 2026 and (4) March 30, 2027, whereby each scenario is given 25% probability of occurring since the actual conversion date is uncertain. The discount rate used is 23.23%.\nThe assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for the conversion option are as follows: (i) equity price of $38,335 per unit calculated as BAMs portion of the future projected profits, on a per unit basis, discounted using Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 15%; (ii) exercise price of $31,250 per unit as there are 40 units in total, (iii) volatility of 90% using BAM as benchmark, (iv) expected life of 2.20 years and (v) risk-free rate of 4.74%.\nThe sum of these two valuation models resulted in an estimated fair value of the loan receivable balance of $1,700,411 as of 31 July 2023. The change in the fair value of the convertible loan receivable has been recorded as a gain on fair value adjustment of convertible loan during the year ended 31 July 2023.\n7.\nLoan receivable\nIn addition to the convertible loan receivable (Note 6), the Company provides operating loans to CCG that are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. During the year ended 31 July 2023, the Company advanced $1,480,021 (2022 - $1,234,168) to CCG and received repayments totaling $2,418,226 (2022 - $843,000) for a net decrease in loan receivable of $938,206 (2022 - net increase of $391,168). At 31 July 2023, the net amount payable to CCG was $148,221 (2022 - receivable of $789,984).

In addition, the operational results of NMG and NMG LB were lower than expected. As a result, the Company impaired property and equipment of NMG and NMG LB resulting in a loss of $2,104,921 during the year ended 31 July 2023.\n9.\nAcquisitions\nCanopy Monterey Bay, LLC - Business Acquisition\nOn 30 November 2021, the Company entered into two definitive agreements with Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC (Canopy) and the membership interest owners (the Sellers) of Canopy to acquire an aggregate of 100% of Canopy, which owns a retail dispensary in the limited license jurisdiction of Seaside, California, to expand our retail operations.\nThe first purchase agreement (PA #1) between DEP and Canopy and all of the Sellers provides for the assignment of 80% of the membership interests of Canopy to DEP in exchange for a purchase price of $4,800,000 comprised of $2,500,000 in cash (the Cash Purchase Price) and a secured promissory note in the amount of $2,300,000 bearing interest at a rate of 10% per annum compounded annually and having a maturity date of five years from the effective date of PA #1. Interest is payable for the first 6 months with the principal and accrued interest due at maturity. There are no prepayment penalties. The Cash Purchase Price is to be paid into escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement between the parties to PA #1 and Secured Trust Escrow, which Cash Purchase Price is to be released to the Sellers upon the receipt of city and state approval and completion of the audited annual financial statements (the Financial Statements) of Canopy, or returned to DEP in the event of the denial of city or state approval or failure to complete the Financial Statements and the agreement is terminated, in which case the 80% membership interests will be transferred back to the Sellers and the promissory note will automatically be terminated. As of the date hereof, the city and state approvals have been received and the formal closing of the purchase of the 80% of the membership interests in Canopy closed in June 2022.\nThe second purchase agreement (PA #2) between DEP and the one continuing Seller provides for the assignment of the remaining 20% of the membership interests of Canopy to DEP following the receipt of the city and state approval and completion of the Financial Statements under PA #1 in exchange for $1,000,000 to be paid in either shares of common stock of the Company (the Consideration Shares) or in cash at DEPs sole option if such payment takes place within six (6) months following the execution of PA #1. If DEP elects to pay the purchase price in Consideration Shares, the amount of Consideration Shares shall be determined based on the 10 day volume weighted average price (VWAP) ending on 30 November 2021, which is US$0.3665 per share for a total of 2,728,156 shares (issued) (Note 14). In the event that six (6) months following the execution of PA #1, the value of the Consideration Shares have decreased such that total value of the Consideration Shares is less than ninety percent (90%) of its value, DEP agrees to cause the Company to issue an additional $100,000 worth of shares of common stock of the Company (the Additional Shares) to be issued to the one continuing Seller based on the ten day VWAP calculated as of six (6) months following the closing of PA #1. This was included as contingent consideration in the purchase price and $100,000 was recorded in accounts payable at 31 July 2022. PA #2 contains a working capital adjustment provision, which provides that if there is a working capital deficiency as of the closing date of PA #1, then the purchase price under PA #2 shall be reduced by the amount of the deficiency, and if there is a working capital surplus as of the closing date of PA #1, then the purchase price under PA #2 shall be increased by the amount of the surplus.\nOn or around 1 December 2021, 80% of the membership interests of Canopy were transferred to DEP for purposes of applying for city and state approvals of the change in ownership of Canopy, however, the purchase price consideration of (i) $2.5 million in cash, and (ii) a promissory note in the amount of $2.3 million to be paid by DEP, were placed in escrow and not to be released to the sellers of the 80% membership interests in Canopy until the city and state approvals have been received and the Financial Statements of Canopy are completed. If the city or state approvals are not received, or the Financial Statements of Canopy are not completed, then the Buyer may terminate the membership interest purchase agreement requiring the membership interests in Canopy to be transferred back to the sellers and the escrow agent to deliver back to DEP the cash consideration and the promissory note shall automatically be terminated. As of the date hereof, the city and state approvals have been received and the formal closing of the purchase of the 80% membership interests in Canopy closed in June 2022.\nOn 17 June 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc., entered into the first amendment to PA #1 and PA #2 (the First Amendment) whereby the cash purchase price under PA #1 will be reduced from $2.5 million to $1.25 million and the Company will issue $1.25 million in shares of common stock of the Company to the Sellers based on the 10 day volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the ten (10) consecutive trading days prior to the effective date of the First Amendment (the Effective Date) and subject to compliance with the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (the CSE), which equates to 9,328,358 shares of common stock. The Company will also issue additional shares to Cary Stiebel equal to the difference between the amount of the shares of common stock of the Company that were issued by the Company to Mr. Stiebel on December 3, 2021 (the PA #2 Shares) and the amount of shares that Mr. Stiebel would have received had the VWAP for the PA #2 Shares been calculated as of the Effective Date (the Additional PA #2 Shares) which equates to 4,734,530 shares of common stock. Additionally, on the date that is eighteen (18) months (548 days) following the Effective Date of this First Amendment (the Additional Share Issuance Date) the Company will issue $100,000 worth of shares to the Sellers based on the ten (10) day VWAP and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE, calculated as of the Additional Share Issuance Date. This $100,000 was recorded as consulting fees for the year ended 31 July 2022. Furthermore, DEP shall cause the Company to issue to Mr. Stiebel $300,000 worth of shares of common stock of the Company within three (3) days following the Effective Date of this First Amendment, and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE (the Additional True up Shares) which equates to 2,238,806 shares of common stock. Prior to the conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital in accordance with PA #1 and PA #2, Sellers shall complete, execute and deliver to DEP Schedule D to the First Amendment, which shall set forth the amount of Additional True-up Shares each Seller is entitled to (as applicable) and such Additional True-up Shares shall be retitled in accordance with Schedule D to the First Amendment. In the event Schedule D to the First Amendment is not completed, executed and delivered to DEP prior to the conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital, DEP shall have no obligation to retitle the shares and all Sellers hereby waive any claims against DEP and the Company in connection with such issuance made in accordance with Section 2(b)(v) of the First Amendment. Upon conclusion of the calculation of the actual working capital in accordance with PA #1 and PA #2, the parties agree as follows:\n(a) If the actual working capital is less than the target working capital of $nil, the Purchase Price (as defined in PA #2) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the target working capital and the actual working capital and all of the Additional True-up Shares shall be forfeited and retuned to Company for cancellation;\n(b) If the actual working capital is greater than the target working capital of $nil and the Additional True-up Shares are sufficient to cover the difference between the actual working capital and the target working capital (the DEP Deficit), the parties agree that all or a portion of the Additional True-up Shares (valued at the ten (10) day VWAP calculated as of the Effective Date of the First Amendment and subject to compliance with the policies of the CSE) shall be issued to Sellers to satisfy the DEP Deficit owed by DEP to the Sellers in accordance with Section 2.02(b) of PA #2;\n(c) If the actual working capital is greater than the target working capital and the Additional True-up Shares are insufficient to cover the DEP Deficit, all of the Additional True-up Shares shall be issued to Sellers and the parties agree that any additional amounts owed to the Sellers shall be paid by DEP to the Sellers via additional shares of common stock of the Company.\nIn addition to the terms of the First Amendment, the parties have agreed that the release of any Additional True-up Shares hereunder shall be subject to the Sellers providing written direction to DEP for the release of the Additional True-up Shares payable under the First Amendment.\nOn December 7, 2022, pursuant to the previously announced (i) membership interest purchase agreement (MIPA #1), dated November 30, 2021, as amended on June 17, 2022, entered into between the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc. (DEP), Canopy Monterey Bay, LLC (Canopy) and the membership interest owners of Canopy, Carey Stiebel (the Continuing Owner), Jana Stiebel, Jayme Rivard, Adrian Dermicek and Laurie Johnson (collectively, the Sellers) to purchase eighty percent (80%) of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Canopy, and (ii) membership interest purchase agreement (MIPA #2), dated November 30, 2021, as amended on June 17, 2022, entered into between DEP and the Continuing Owner to purchase the remaining twenty percent (20%) of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Canopy, the Company through DEP completed the acquisition of all of the membership interests of Canopy from the Sellers and closed MIPA #1, as amended, and MIPA #2, as amended.\nPursuant to the closing of MIPA #1, as amended, and MIPA #2, as amended, the Company issued an aggregate of 16,301,694 shares of common stock to the Sellers in accordance with their instructions at a deemed price of US$0.134 per share. 2,238,806 of the 16,301,694 shares are being held in escrow pending the results of a working capital adjustment in accordance with MIPA #1 and MIPA #2.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. For accounting purposes, the acquisition date is the date that the Company obtained full control over the operations, although not all conditions for closing the acquisition had occurred as of 1 December 2021. The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, which were recorded as of the acquisition date, as well as the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of Canopy made by the Company:\nPurchase consideration\nCash\n$ 1,250,000\nPromissory note\n2,300,000\nShares of common stock (Note 14)\n2,189,544\nContingent consideration\n100,000\nTotal consideration\n5,839,544\nAssets acquired:\nCash\n378,503\nPrepaid expenses\n241,449\nInventory\n630,039\nLiabilities assumed:\nTrade payable and accrued liabilities\n(266,307 )\nIncome taxes payable\n(1,229,213 )\nNet assets acquired\n(245,529 )\nBrand and licenses\n1,240,000\nGoodwill\n4,845,073\nTOTAL\n$ 5,839,544\nDuring the year ended 31 July 2022, the Company also recorded a loss on settlement of contingent consideration of $503,179 resulting from the fair value adjustment of the Companys shares of common stock that have not been issued at 31 July 2022 and also recorded a consulting fee of $100,000 to be paid to the sellers in shares that was not included in the purchase consideration.\nPro Forma\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the year ended 31 July 2022 as though the acquisition of Canopy had occurred on 1 August 2021:\nYear ended 31 July 2022\nAs Reported\nPro Forma (unaudited)\nRevenue\n$ 23,372,823\n$ 26,661,994\nNet loss\n(28,228,104 )\n(28,212,341 )\nThe unaudited pro forma information set forth above is for informational purposes only and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation, in all material respects, of the Companys combined operations including Canopy as if the business combinations occurred on 1 August 2021. No adjustments have been made to reflect potential cost savings that may occur subsequent to completion of the transactions. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to reflect the results of operations of the Company which would have actually resulted had the proposed transaction been effected on the date indicated above. Further, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be obtained in the future. The actual pro forma adjustments will depend on a number of factors, and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma financial information.\nCraftedPlants NJ Corp (Merger) - Asset Acquisition from a Related Party\nOn December 21, 2022, the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, Inc. (DEP), BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ Inc., a New Jersey corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of DEP (the Merger Sub), CraftedPlants NJ Corp., a New Jersey corporation (the Surviving Entity), an entity controlled by a Director of the Company, and those certain shareholders of the Surviving Entity (the Sellers) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) whereby the Merger Sub merged with and into the Surviving Entity, and following the consummation of the merger, which occurred on December 21, 2022, the Surviving Entity became a wholly owned subsidiary of DEP and changed its name to BaM Body and Mind Dispensary NJ, Inc. (the Merged Entity).\nCraftedPlants NJ Corp. had a lease in Lawrenceville, New Jersey that was already zoned for cannabis retail store. There is no operational history for CraftedPlants NJ Corp. and is essentially comprised of one operating lease asset. The lease agreement does not include any provision that would revoke the approval for a cannabis retail store in a change of ownership of CraftedPlants NJ. Management is not aware of any laws and regulations that would revoke the zoning approval upon change of ownership. The purpose of the merger is expansion into the New Jersey adult use market through merging with an entity with a lease in New Jersey with local preapproval for an adult us cannabis location. The compensation for merger is contingent on success milestones including granting of pending license approval from the State of New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission and opening of the business as a recreational cannabis dispensary.\nThe Company also entered into a three-year strategic advisory services agreement with Bengal Impact Partners, LLC (Bengal Capital) dated 5 January 2023 (Bengal Advisory Agreement). The Company shall pay Bengal Capital $240,000 on each anniversary, of which $60,000 is to be paid in cash and $180,000 is to be paid in cash, common stock, or warrants to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, in such proportions as are determined by the Company. In addition, if the Company successfully obtains a cultivation license in New Jersey during the term of the Bengal Advisory Agreement, the Company will owe a fee of $1,000,000, which will be payable in the form of the Companys common stock or a warrant to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, in either case as requested by Bengal Capital.\nBengal Catalyst Funds and CraftedPlants NJ Corp were both owned or managed by the principals of the Bengal Capital Group and Bengal Catalyst Fund also participated in the 19 December 2022 convertible debenture financings (Note 12). Joshua Rosen is a managing principal of the Bengal Capital Group and he was involved in both transactions of the convertible note investment and the merger acquisition of Crafted Plants NJ Corp. Joshua Rosen was appointed as a director of the Company effective 1 February 2023, and therefore this transaction is considered a related party transaction.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on the closing DEP delivered a cash payment of $50,000 to the Sellers, with a delayed payment of approximately $120,000 to be paid to the Sellers upon funding of the project buildout which is anticipated to occur after receipt of the New Jersey state license and local construction approvals.\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on December 21, 2022, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 16,666,667 shares of its common stock (the Merger Consideration Shares). The Merger Consideration Shares will be held in escrow and will not be released to the Sellers until the Surviving Entity achieves certain milestones, however, the Sellers will still maintain the voting and participation rights with respect to the Merger Consideration Shares while being held in escrow. The post-closing milestones are as follows:\n1.\nIf, within two (2) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entitys application is approved and is granted pending license approval from the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the CRC), 70% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be release from escrow.\n2.\nIf, within three (3) years of the closing date, the Surviving Entity opens for business as a recreational cannabis dispensary, 30% of the Merger Consideration Shares will be released from escrow.\nIf either or both of the milestones are not achieved within the time periods after the closing date (the Milestone Dates), the Company shall have the option to cancel the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone by delivering written notice to Sellers and in the event of such cancellation, the portion of the Merger Consideration Shares attributable to the failed milestone shall be surrendered and cancelled without any further action required by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either or both of the milestones are not achieved (or if it becomes obvious that they will not be achieved) by their respective Milestone Dates because of delays that are not caused by the Sellers, the Sellers may, before the applicable Milestone Dates, provide notice to the Company, and the applicable Milestone Date will be extended to such date as is reasonably necessary for the milestone to be achieved. The parties will work together in mutual good faith to determine the dates by when the milestones can be reasonably achieved. If the Company fails to diligently pursue issuance of the state recreational licenses at any time prior to the second anniversary, and the Company fails to cure such failures in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Company will owe to Sellers a termination fee equal to 25% of the Merger Consideration Shares.\nThe likelihood of achieving both milestones is uncertain at this time and, as such, the Company recorded the Merger Consideration Shares at par value.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition since the Surviving Entity did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with ASC 805, as it had no outputs and did not have a substantive process that could significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. In accordance with ASC 805-50 and measurement of share-based payment in ASC 718, the acquisition should be measured on the date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree. The date on which the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree generally is the date on which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration, acquires the assets, and assumes the liabilities of the acquiree.\nThe Company obtained 100% ownership and control over the Merged Entity and the lease asset on 21 December 2022.

Each of NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 have been identified in the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) results of the Social Equity Justice Involved Lottery for 55 Conditional Adult-Use Cannabis Dispensary Licenses (Conditional Licenses) across the state. The certified results are from a lottery with a pool of applicants who scored 85% or greater in their applications. NMG IL 1 and NMG IL 4 were drawn in BLS Region #5 (Chicago-Naperville-Elgin) where 36 conditional licenses are available. The applications are not tied to specified locations. The Transaction with NMG IL 4 was completed on 25 April 2023 (Note 9). The final ownership changes are currently under review by the state and anticipated to be approved in the near term.

On 17 October 2023, pursuant to (the Disposition). Pursuant to the closing of the Disposition, on 17 October 2023 (the Closing Date), the Purchaser paid an initial total consideration of US$8.225 million (US$7,975,000 on closing plus US$250,000 deposit upon signing of the EPA) (the Initial Purchase Price) in cash to DEP Nevada, which Initial Purchase Price is subject to a working capital adjustment and other customary adjustments pursuant to the EPA to be calculated within 365 days of the Closing Date (the Final Purchase Price). Also see Note 21.\nMembership Interest Purchase Agreement (NMG OH P1)\nOn September 5, 2023, DEP entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) with LMTB LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (the LMTB), pursuant to which DEP will sell the issued and outstanding membership interests (the NMG OH P1 Interests) in NMG OH P1 to LMTB for the purchase price of US$2,000,000, subject to adjustment in the event that NMG OH P1s Working Capital (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) on the NMG OH P1 Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) varies from the Target Working Capital (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement and thereby fixed at zero (0) dollars). An amount equal to the Deposit (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement), being US$1,000,000, shall be held in escrow by Murphy Schiller & Wilkes LLP as escrow agent (the NMG OH P1 Escrow Agent) pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement entered into among DEP, NMG OH P1 and LMTB contemporaneously with the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn April 2023, the Company approved the sale of the Michigan retail operation, which was completed in June 2023.\nAssets held for sale related to Ohio operations and Michigan retail operation represent a strategic shift in the Company's operations and therefore is classified as available for sale subsidiaries and discontinued operations as of 31 July 2023.\nDuring the year ended 31 July 2023, the Company performed an analysis of any impairments prior to reclassifying certain assets as held for sale and recorded an impairment of $944,015 which is included as a component of loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n20.\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of the income tax expense for continuing operations consisted of the following:\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$ 2,588,522\n$ 1,540,516\nState\n7,471\n61,153\n2,595,993\n1,601,669\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(427,507 )\n4,787\nState\n-\n168,153\n(427,507 )\n172,940\nTotal expense for income taxes\n$ 2,168,486\n$ 1,774,609\nSection 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) prohibits businesses engaged in the trafficking of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances from deducting normal business expenses, such as payroll and rent, from gross income (revenue less cost of goods sold). Section 280E was originally intended to penalize criminal market operators, but because cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance for U.S. Federal purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has subsequently applied Section 280E to state-legal cannabis businesses. Cannabis businesses operating in states that align their tax codes with the IRC are also unable to deduct normal business expenses from their state taxes. The nondeductible expenses shown in the effective rate reconciliation above is comprised primarily of the impact of applying Section 280E to the Companys businesses that are involved in selling cannabis, along with other typical non-deductible expenses such as lobbying expenses.\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the reported income tax (benefit) expense are summarized below:\nNet loss for the year before income tax\n$ (18,154,204 )\n$ (26,640,745 )\nFederal and state income tax rates\n21.00 %\n21.00 %\nExpected income tax recovery\n(3,806,994 )\n(5,594,555 )\nState taxes\n(615,593 )\n(474,933 )\nStock options\n-\n118,816\nIRC 280E disallowance\n4,318,695\n7,648,632\nDeferred tax adjustment\n(757,256 )\n(585,809 )\nReturn to provision\n(1,543,140 )\n-\nValuation allowance\n968,717\n724,287\nChange in state tax rate\n(186,076 )\n-\nUncertain tax position\n3,790,133\n-\nOther\n-\n(61,829 )\nTotal income tax expense\n$ 2,168,486\n$ 1,774,609\nThe impact of the loss on impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, ROU assets, and loans receivable in the aggregate amount of $9,370,092 is included in the IRC 280E disallowance for 2023. Approximately $19 million was included in the IRC 280E disallowance for the year ended 31 July 2023 related to the impairment losses.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAs at 31 July\nAs at 31 July\nDeferred income tax asset\nFixed assets\n$ 98,512\n$ -\nBrand and license\n605,980\n559,032\nLease liabilities\n595,496\n342,437\nInvestments\n263,188\n126,395\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n775,060\n276,739\nGross deferred tax assets\n2,338,236\n1,304,602\nLess: valuation allowance\n(1,854,715 )\n(854,143 )\nTotal deferred tax assets\n$ 483,521\n$ 450,459\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nInventory\n$ -\n$ 541,689\nRight-of-use assets\n483,521\n232,939\nFY 21 & FY 22 481(a) Adjustment\n-\n-\nFixed assets\n-\n103,601\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n$ 483,521\n$ 878,229\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$ -\n$ (427,770 )\nManagement regularly assesses the ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded based upon the weight of available evidence, including such factors as recent earnings history and expected future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. In the event that the Company changes its determination as to the amount of realizable deferred tax assets, the Company will adjust its valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The Companys management believes that, based on a number of factors, it is more likely than not, that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized; and accordingly, for the fiscal year ended 31 July 2023, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against the Companys U.S. net deferred tax assets. The net change in the valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended 31 July 2023 was an increase/(decrease) of $1,000,572.\nThe Company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $Nil and $9,092,933, respectively, as of 31 July 2023. State NOL will begin to expire in 2042 and $Nil of the Company's federal NOL will last indefinitely (limited to 80% of taxable income in a given year).\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. Accordingly, a companys ability to use net operating losses may be limited as prescribed under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (IRC Section 382). Events which may cause limitations in the amount of the net operating losses that the Company may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period. Utilization of the federal and state net operating losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions. The Company may, in the future, experience one or more additional Section 382 ownership changes. If so, the Company may not be able to utilize some of its carryforwards or other tax attributes, even if the Company achieves profitability in the jurisdiction of the carryforwards or other tax attributes. The Company has not completed a study to assess whether a change of ownership has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since its formation, due to the significant cost and complexity associated with such a study. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed by the Company and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.\nAs of 31 July 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $3,648,717, which includes interest and penalties. As of 31 July 2023, $3,648,717 of the total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would have an impact on the Company's effective tax rate.\nThe Company estimates that approximately $591,087 of unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, may be recognized in the next 12 months.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, California, and Michigan and locally in Ohio. The Companys tax years for 2019 and forward are subject to examination by the US tax authorities. The Companys tax years for 2019 and forward are subject to examination by various state tax authorities.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions, excluding the impact of penalties and interest. The tax accounting method was changed to the Farm Price method which allows a more granular assessment of each expense, for the cultivation and manufacturing operations only, to be applied and expensed as cost of goods, to determine net taxable income.\nAs at 31 July 2023\nAs at 31 July 2022\nBeginning year balance\n$ 966,992\n$ 996,992\nIncrease in balance related to tax positions taken during current year\n1,068,590\n-\nDecrease in balance as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\n(406,508 )\n-\nIncrease in balance related to tax positions taken during prior years\n2,019,643\n-\nNet deferred income tax liability\n$ 3,648,717\n$ 996,992\nOn 27 March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), P.L. 116-136, was passed into law, amending portions of relevant US tax laws, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted and accounted for in FY18. Some of the laws that were revised were the IRC 163(j) interest expense limitation; net operating loss carryback, carryforward, and utilization rules; and qualified improvement property depreciation methods. As the CARES Act was enacted prior to the Companys year-end, the Company has accounted for all of the applicable changes in tax law in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended 31 July 2023 and 2022 and has determined that any impact is not material to its financial statements.\nBeginning on 1 January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), enacted in December 2017, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize U.S.-based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively. There is no impact to our current income tax provision as a result of this tax legislation.\n21.\nSubsequent Events\nConvertible Loan Agreement Assignment\nOn or around August 22, 2023, DEP assigned the Convertible Loan Agreement to a related entity, Big Stone Farms AR 1, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company, which is wholly owned by the Companys Chief Operating Officer and Director, in exchange for an option to purchase the outstanding interests of Big Stone Farms AR 1, LLC for a purchase price of $1.00.\nMembership Interest Purchase Agreement (NMG OH P1)\nOn September 5, 2023, DEP entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) with LMTB LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (the LMTB), pursuant to which DEP will sell the issued and outstanding membership interests (the NMG OH P1 Interests) in NMG OH P1 to LMTB for the purchase price of US$2,000,000, subject to adjustment in the event that NMG OH P1s Working Capital (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement) on the NMG OH P1 Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) varies from the Target Working Capital (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement and thereby fixed at zero (0) dollars). An amount equal to the Deposit (as defined in the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement), being US$1,000,000, shall be held in escrow by Murphy Schiller & Wilkes LLP as escrow agent (the NMG OH P1 Escrow Agent) pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement entered into among DEP, NMG OH P1 and LMTB contemporaneously with the NMG OH P1 Purchase Agreement.\nClosing of Equity Purchase Agreement (NMG OH 1)\nOn 17 October 2023, pursuant to equity purchase agreement (the EPA) dated 21 July 2023, between the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada, NMG OH 1 and FarmaceuticalRX, LLC (the Purchaser), DEP sold all of the issued and outstanding interests and other ownership, equity or profits interests in NMG OH 1 to the Purchaser (the Disposition).\nPursuant to the closing of the Disposition, on 17 October 2023 (the Closing Date), the Purchaser paid an initial total consideration of US$8.225 million (US$7,975,000 on closing plus US$250,000 deposit upon signing of the EPA) (the Initial Purchase Price) in cash to DEP Nevada, which Initial Purchase Price is subject to a working capital adjustment and other customary adjustments pursuant to the EPA to be calculated within 365 days of the Closing Date (the Final Purchase Price). Based on the Accepted Adjustment Statement (as defined in the EPA), the parties shall determine if the Final Purchaser Price shall be adjusted upwards or downwards. An amount equal to the Escrow Amount (as defined in the EPA) of US$100,000 from the Final Purchase Price is being held in escrow and will be released to DEP Nevada on the fifth day of the twelfth month after the Closing Date unless there are any indemnification claims pending until such time as the claim is resolved.\nIn addition, DEP Nevada shall receive a payment of US$2,500,000 (each, a Bonus Payment) for each additional dispensary license granted to NMG OH 1 by the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy or other regulatory body, in accordance with the terms of the EPA. Additional dispensary licenses that will receive the Bonus Payment shall specifically exclude an adult use license issued for the License (as defined in the EPA) and current lease location.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the EPA, the Company used US$7.33 million of the Initial Purchase Price funds to fully repay the debt owing to its senior secured lender.

The Company was unable to perform an adequate assessment and procedures in determining effective internal control over financial reporting.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting. This attestation report by our registered public accounting firm was not required pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only our managements report on internal control over financial reporting.\nWe will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action by implementing additional enhancements or improvements, or deploying additional human resources as may be deemed necessary.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last quarter of our fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Since we acquired NMG, raised equity capital and have been generative revenues from the sale of our products, we have been compensating our NEOs at levels comparable to executive officers of companies within its industry at similar stages of growth.\nOur Compensation Committee reviews and recommends to our Board of Directors the salaries, and benefits of all employees, consultants, directors and other individuals compensated by us. The Board of Directors assumes responsibility for reviewing the recommendations of the Compensation Committee and monitoring the long-range compensation strategy for our senior management. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors reviews the compensation of senior management on a semi-annual basis taking into account compensation paid by other issuers of similar size and activity. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors receives independent competitive market information on compensation levels for executives. It uses salary data of comparable private and public companies as a benchmark for setting executive compensation. This data is obtained from various sources including online research and market surveys.\nAlthough permitted, at this time no NEO or director has or intends to purchase financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the NEO or director.\nElements of the Compensation Program\nThe total compensation plan for NEOs consists of a base compensation structure and equity-based compensation program in the form of stock options. The compensation program for our senior management is designed with a view that the level and form of compensation achieves certain objectives, including:\n(a)\nattracting and retaining qualified executives;\n(b)\nmotivating the short and long-term performance of these executives; and\n(c)\nbetter aligning their interests with those of the Companys shareholders.\nIn compensating our senior management, we have arranged for equity participation through our 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan.\nBase Salary\nThe base salary component of NEO compensation is intended to provide a fixed level of competitive pay that reflects each NEOs primary duties and responsibilities. The policy of Body and Mind is that salaries for its NEOs are competitive within its industry and generally set at the median salary level among entities its size.\nStock Options\nOn February 3, 2023, our Board of Directors adopted the 2023 Stock and Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan). The purpose of the 2023 Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by aiding the Company in attracting and retaining employees, officers, consultants, advisors and non-employee directors capable of assuring the future success of the Company, to offer such persons incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Companys business and to compensate such persons through various stock and cash-based arrangements and provide them with opportunities for stock ownership in the Company, thereby aligning the interests of such persons with the Companys stockholders.\nThe 2023 Plan supersedes, replaces and is in substitution for the Companys 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan, which was originally ratified by the Board on October 25, 2012, as was ratified by the stockholders of the Company at the Companys annual meeting held on December 10, 2012. There are 7,553,000 stock options outstanding under the 2012 Incentive and Stock Option Plan as of the date of adoption of the 2023 Plan, which are covered under the 2023 Plan, and which was approved by the Companys shareholders on March 31, 2023.\nCompensation Governance\nOur Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending to our Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to our directors and executive officers.

In addition, shares of common stock are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares of common stock outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.
