    "content": "Item 1. Business\nAstra Energy is an emerging company in the waste management industry and the electricity and power generation sectors with a focus on energy production from solar, waste conversion and clean burning fuels. The Company strives to advance clean energy initiatives globally while delivering measurable benefits to communities and value to our investors by investing in and developing renewable and clean energy projects in markets where demand is high and supply is limited.\nWASTE CONVERSION:\nIn August 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. (Regreen), a California based company with innovative and patented waste conversion technology and equipment. The Regreen Total Waste System converts municipal solid waste, food waste and plant waste raw material into biomass pellets which are then converted to various fuels and end products. In contrast to typical incinerator based WTE systems, the Regreen Total Waste System uses pyrolysis to burn and convert waste. Pyrolysis is an oxygen-absent process that converts dehydrated biomass into flammable liquids and gases under high temperature conditions. The Regreen system works by converting MSW into dried pellets with extremely low moisture content, which are then fed into a pyrolizer. The pyrolizer produces pyro oils (which can be used in generators and engines), carbon black (typically used in rubber manufacturing), and Syngas, which is further processed to yield jet fuel, green diesel, and bitumen (which can be used for asphalt and roofing).\nWe will specialize in providing sustainable waste and energy solutions and will safely convert millions of tons of waste from municipalities and businesses into valuable clean, renewable biofuels, biodiesel and jet fuel. The Company will provide comprehensive material management services to communities seeking solutions to some of todays most complex environmental challenges. The systems used in the power facilities will greatly reduce or eliminate methane emissions from landfills, as well as reduce reliance on imported fuels by replacing them with biofuels made from agricultural products. The Company will create a valued intellectual property portfolio by way of securing global licenses for or co-developing technologies that can convert multiple different waste streams into renewable fuel sources more efficiently and at a considerably lower cost.\nRecent legislation in California which requires food waste to be composted with the goal to reduce food waste in landfills by 75%. The State is directly in support of this system as a result. SB 1383, establishes methane reduction targets for California. California SB 1383 is a bill that sets goals to reduce disposal of organic waste in landfills, including edible food. The bills purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane, and address food insecurity in California. Aspects of this law ensure that food scraps are composted and compost is purchased by cities. Composting, industrial uses, and animal feed are good environmental uses for inedible food or other organic material. Landfilling organic waste is a significant source of local air quality pollutants, which can cause respiratory issues and hospitalizations for community members. Beyond this, we are seeing the effects of climate change in California with more severe and lengthy droughts, warmer temperatures that contribute to the increasing number of wildfires (also impacting air quality), bigger storms, and coastal erosion due to rising sea levels. To address the environmental and health concerns of surplus edible food, this law requires 20% of edible food that would otherwise be disposed of in the garbage or compost be recovered for human consumption by 2025. This means surplus edible food will help feed Californians in need instead of decomposing in a landfill while emitting harmful greenhouse gases.\nIn May 2022, Regreen entered into a Letter of Intent to install a One Ton-Per-Hour system at a material recovery facility in California. Completion of the installation is pending California Local Enforcement Agency approval relating to solid waste disposal.\nOn November 20, 2022, Regreen entered into a Joint Venture Investment Cooperation Agreement with Viecotech Joint Stock Company, a Vietnamese based company for the manufacture, distribution, and deployment of the patented Regreen waste processing system in the Asia Pacific region. Regreen will hold 50% ownership in the Joint Venture.\nRegreen is currently in negotiations to sell, joint venture and deploy the Regreen system in several countries including India, Panama, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Jamaica, and Ecuador.\nAstra Energy is advancing a waste to energy project on the island of Zanzibar to convert 15 tons of municipal solid waste per hour into 10MW/hour of electric power. The project will enable the island to dispose of all its garbage, thereby avoiding the need for a garbage landfill. Landfills are major generators of methane, a major greenhouse gas that is responsible for global warming. There are continuing discussions with the island government.\nThe preliminary plan is for Astra to develop, operate, and maintain the waste to energy infrastructure. The power will be fed into the islands grid network pursuant to a power purchase agreement.\nSOLAR:\nWe are currently completing a feasibility study for the supply and installation of a 40 MW solar farm with battery storage on the island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The plan is to secure a power purchase agreement to feed the power into the grid network. The island of Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous territory of Tanzania in the Indian ocean. Electric power to the island is currently provided using two 100MW submarine cables from mainland Tanzania. These cables are now at capacity. The island wishes to have an independent power supply. Therefore, the immediate need for an additional 50MW of power in less than two years. The Company has initiated negotiations with the government of Zanzibar to provide the required power.\nPOWER GENERATION\nIn October, 2022, the Company entered into a Joint Venture with Holcomb Scientific Research Ltd. (HSR) to manufacture and distribute the innovative and patent protected Holcomb Inline Generator for homes, commercial applications, solar projects, electric vehicles, large power scale power plants, and many more applications.\nHSR is a Research and Development company that has created the patent-protected Holcomb Energy System, a scientific breakthrough in clean energy generation. The HES utilizes the natural energy produced by the electron spin in the iron atom, converting it into usable electricity while requiring no fuel, releasing zero carbon emissions, and having no moving parts - therefore running completely silent.\nCLEAN ENERGY:\nAstra Energy in concert with the government of Tanzania is advancing a 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant project. The government of Tanzania provided a positive response to the expression of interest and they have requested a technical proposal. Astra is applying for Advocacy support for this project from the US Mission in Tanzania.\nThe Company is currently in negotiations to acquire an existing 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Power Plant (the Plant).\nAstra is in continuing discussions to secure a gas supply agreement with the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation for the natural gas required to fuel the Plant. Once the agreement is executed, we will begin the process of relocating the Plant to Tanzania. As the Plant is installed, the Company will finalize power purchase agreements and distribution agreements. Item 1A.

Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe following information contains certain forward-looking statements of our management. Forward-looking statements are statements that estimate the happening of future events and are not based on historical fact. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as may, could, expect, estimate, anticipate, plan, predict, probable, possible, should, continue, or similar terms, variations of those terms or the negative of those terms. The forward-looking statements specified in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered by management to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or warranty is to be inferred from those forward-looking statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRefer to Note 2 of our financial statements contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a summary of our critical accounting policies and recently adopting and issued accounting standards.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended August 31, 2022, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2021\nRevenue increased to $25,000 from $0 for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $179,132 from $91,149 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased primarily in audit and legal expenses, regulatory filing costs, transfer agent fees and general business development costs.\nBusiness development expenses increased to $712,683 from $160,012 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Business development expenses increased primarily in legal costs, travel, engineering studies and consulting fees.\nExecutive compensation expenses increased to $1,034,450 from $515,579 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Executive compensation expenses increased primarily as a result of stock compensation for executives for services rendered.\nStock compensation-consulting expenses increased to $595,500 from $169,250 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, primarily as a result of the issuance of stock for services rendered by advisors, consultants and other non-related parties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have an accumulated deficit at August 31, 2022 of $32,523,735. We expect to incur substantial expenses and generate continued operating losses until we generate revenues sufficient to meet our obligations. At August 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $198,899. We will need to rely on private capital investment or loans to fund future operations for the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Statements of Cash Flows:\nYears Ended August 31,\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities\n$ (1,073,866 )\n$ (461,235 )\nFinancing activities\n$ 1,178,000\n$ 556,000\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $1,073,866 and $461,235 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in cash used for operating activities was primarily for general operating costs, executive compensation, consulting fees and business development costs.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $1,178,000 and $556,000 for the years ended August 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to an increase in the issuances of common stock for cash.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe prepaid asset of $27,026,000 relates to the potential acquisition of Regreen Technologies, Inc. The valuation of this asset is subject to the completion of milestones in the underlying agreement and all parties meeting requirements. The amount may be impacted by cancellation of the acquisition and/or inability for parties to meet milestones in future periods. There was no impact to the results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2022, as the company has only issued common stock (currently held in escrow) to Regreen for the acquisition. If, upon completion of the acquisition, there has been a material change to the financial condition of Regreen, it may impact the final valuation for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect the liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.\nAs a \"smaller reporting company\", we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe following consolidated financial statements are filed as part of this Annual Report:\nASTRA ENERGY INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB #05525)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) for the Years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Astra Energy, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Astra Energy, Inc (the Company) as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit and minimal revenue. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of the Prepaid Acquisition Expenses - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company issued stock held in escrow for the future acquisition of Regreen Technologies, Inc. and recorded an asset for the potential merger. The valuation of the asset and stock issued are subject to management estimates and judgment. Audit of the valuation of the asset is judgmental due to reliance on the likelihood of future events.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate valuation of the related asset consisted of the following, among others:\n\u00b7\nWe evaluated managements assumptions related to the valuation of the asset and stock issued.\n\u00b7\nWe considered whether the assumptions related to the merger agreement appear reasonable.\n\u00b7\nWe performed an independent analysis of the transaction and valuation and compared to managements analysis.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nSpokane, Washington\nDecember 14, 2022\nASTRA ENERGY INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash\n$ 198,899\n$ 94,765\nPrepaid stock for acquisition (Note 4)\n27,026,000\n-\nOther receivable -

(the Company, Astra), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2000.\nA Certificate of Amendment was filed on August 22, 2020 with the Nevada Secretary of State changing the name of the Company to Astra Energy, Inc.\nThe Company is an emerging leader in the acquisition and development of technology in the Waste-to-Energy project sector.\nOn October 17, 2019, there was an order by the Eight Judicial District Court of Clark County Nevada appointing a Custodian to the Company. The custodianship was discharged on June 18, 2020.\nOn September 15, 2021, the Company affected a forward stock split of 3 for 1 which was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). All shares throughout these statements reflect the forward split.\nOn September 21, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Uganda called Astra Energy Africa - SMC Limited.\nOn October 12, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Uganda called Astra Energy Services Limited. The Company is owned 80% by Astra Energy Inc. and 20% by Ssingo Oils and Gas - SMC Limited of Mityana, Uganda.\nOn November 15, 2021, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of California called Astra Energy California, Inc.\nOn December 22, 2021, the Company incorporated a subsidiary in Tanzania called Astra Energy Tanzania Limited. The Company is owned 80% by Astra Energy Inc. and 20% by Kiluwa Group of Companies Limited of Kinondoni, Tanzania.\nOn August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 68.2% interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. (Regreen), a California corporation, in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock and an agreement to pay $250,000 in cash. Regreen is in the business of converting organic and solid waste material into marketable bio-products utilizing its patented series of equipment and processes.\nOn August 17, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 8.7% interest in Regreen Technologies Inc. in exchange for 1,300,000 shares of the Companys common stock and an agreement to pay $400,000 in cash.\nOn August 17, 2022, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the State of Florida called Astra Holcomb Energy Systems Inc.\nNOTE 2 -SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) which the Company controls. For accounting purposes, control is established by an investor when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and when it can affect those returns through its power over the entity. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all cash accounts, which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturities for the instruments held. The Company had no cash equivalents as of August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based transactions with employees and non-employees under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which establishes that equity-based payments to employees and non-employees are recorded at the grant date the fair value of the equity instruments the entity is obligated to issue when the employees and non-employees have rendered the requisite service and satisfied any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments. Topic 718 also states that observable market prices of identical or similar equity or liability instruments in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and, if available, should be used as the basis for the measurement for equity and liability instruments awarded in these share-based payment transactions. However, if observable market prices of identical or similar equity or liability instruments are not available, the fair value shall be estimated by using a valuation technique or model that complies with the measurement objective, as described in FASB ASC Topic 718.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf\nIdentification of a contract with a customer;\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf\nRecognition of revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, we recognized revenue of $25,000 ($nil-August 31, 2021), all of which was from one customer.\nNet income (loss) per common share\nNet income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The following is the calculation as of August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNet Loss\n$ (2,634,545 )\n$ (1,056,649 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic and diluted\n45,567,354\n35,198,315\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted\n$ (0.06 )\n$ (0.03 )\nThe weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented.\nFor the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company has 10,667 potentially dilutive shares from Series A preferred stock and 380,698 potentially dilutive shares from the Series D preferred stock. Any potentially dilutive shares have not been included due to their anti-dilutive effect, as the Company as a net loss.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN\nAs reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $32,523,735 as of August 31, 2022, and minimal revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company is planning to secure its financial capital in various ways. It will finance its operations initially through shareholder loans from the principals and through private placement investment offerings. The Company may decide to finance its project development stage by way of an equity offering by issuing shares or by engaging venture capital firms that invest in early-stage companies. Venture capital firms August do more than just supply money to small new opportunities. They can also provide advice on potential products, customers, and key employees.\nThe company will also look to develop a relationship with a bank or banks with the intention of demonstrating a track record of progress and building value and securing some form of financing in the future. Once Astra Energy Inc. has a record of at least earning significant revenues, and better still of earning profits, the firm can make a credible promise to pay interest, and so it becomes possible for the firm to borrow money. Firms have two main methods of borrowing: banks and bonds.\nIf Astra Energy is earning profits (their revenues are greater than costs), the Company can choose to reinvest some of these profits in equipment, structures, and research and development. For many established companies, reinvesting their own profits is one primary source of financial capital.\nAnother source of financial capital that will be considered at the project development stage of a specific project is a bond. A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future. A corporate bond is issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. For example, a municipal bond is issued by cities, a state bond by U.S. states, and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. A bond specifies an amount that will be borrowed, the interest rate that will be paid, and the time until repayment. Given the nature of the renewable industry regarding long term power purchase agreements or offtake agreements bonds are a very cost effective and reliable method of funding projects.\nNOTE 4 - PREPAID STOCK FOR ACQUISITION\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a 68.2% interest (the Interest) in Regreen Technologies Inc., a California corporation in the business of converting solid waste material into a marketable bio-product with its patented series of equipment and processes. Regreen is the owner of all the patents for the equipment and the processes.\nThe purchase price of the Interest is $250,000 cash and 10 million shares of the Companys common stock (the Astra Shares). The Closing Date is anticipated to be December 15, 2022.\nThe cash and share consideration, which will be paid into escrow, will be subject to the following milestone and payment schedules:\nOn the Closing Date, the Company will release 2,500,000 Astra Shares from escrow and pay $50,000 in cash.\nUpon completion of the installation and full operation of a Regreen System at the Hesperia, California site, or such other site as the parties agree to in writing, the Company will pay $50,000 cash and release 2,500,000 from escrow.\nUpon completion of three months of the Regreen System operating at a minimum of 50% of expected yields, the Company will pay $50,000 cash.\nUpon completion of six months of the Regreen System operating at a minimum of 50% of expected yields, the Company will pay $50,000 cash and release 2,500,000 Astra Shares from escrow.\nUpon completion of twelve months of the Regreen System operating at a minimum of 50% of expected yields, the Company will pay $50,000 and release 2,500,000 Astra Shares from escrow.\nIn exchange for the Seller assigning all patents to Regreen, it is agreed that Regreen will pay to the Seller the total sum of $3,000,000 from the proceeds of the sale of a 15TPH Regreen System if the system is sold at a minimum price of $12,500,000. If the selling price is less than $12,500,000 the the Seller will receive 8% of the sale price of the 15 TPH system sold and additional 15 TPH systems sold until the Seller has received a total of $3,000,\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a 3.8% interest (the Interest) in Regreen Technologies Inc., a California corporation in the business of converting solid waste material into a marketable bio-product with its patented series of equipment and processes. Regreen is the owner of all the patents for the equipment and the processes.\nThe purchase price of the Interest is $400,000 cash and 1.3 million shares of the Companys common stock (the Astra Shares). The Closing Date is anticipated to be December 15, 2022.\nThe cash and share consideration, which will be paid into escrow, will be subject to the following milestone and payment schedules:\nOn the Closing Date, the Company will pay $50,000 cash and release the 1.3 Astra Shares.\nUpon completion of the installation and full operation of a Regreen System at Advanced Waste Disposal in Hesperia, California the Company will pay $50,000 cash.\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company will pay $150,000 cash.\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company will pay $150,000 cash.\nThe prepaid asset of $27,026,000 relates to the potential acquisition of Regreen Technologies, Inc. The valuation of this asset is subject to the completion of milestones in the underlying agreement and all parties meeting requirements. The amount may be impacted by cancellation of the acquisition and/or inability for parties to meet milestones in future periods. There was no impact to the results of operations for the year ended August 31, 2022, as the company has only issued common stock (currently held in escrow) to Regreen for the acquisition. If, upon completion of the acquisition, there has been a material change to the financial condition of Regreen, it may impact the final valuation for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.\nNOTE 5 - OTHER RECEIVABLE - RELATED PARTY\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, the Company advanced $194,520 to Regreen Technologies Inc., a related party.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Act of 1934. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be included in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, relating to the Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries, and was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2022 because of the material weaknesses identified in our internal controls over financial reporting.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As of August 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). A Material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) Auditing Standard No. 2) or a combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Based on such assessment, management concluded that as of August 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Management has identified the following material weakness:\n\u00b7\ninadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives\n\u00b7\ninsufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements\nPlanned Remediation\nWith the oversight of senior management and our audit committee, we are taking the steps below and plan to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weaknesses:\n\u00b7\nThe Company will take steps to remediate the control activities material weakness through the documentation of processes and controls for transactions that occur in the course of business, and in the financial statement close, reporting and disclosure processes.\n\u00b7\nThe Company will formalize our process and documentation for monitoring internal control over financial reporting. The documentation will serve as the evidence to ascertain whether the control activities are present and functioning, and provide a foundation for the Company to communicate internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action.\nIn addition, under the direction of the audit committee of the Board of Directors, management will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of the Companys internal control environment, as well as to refine policies and procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of the Company.\nWe cannot be assured that the measures we have taken to date, or plan to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, as such report is not required due to the Companys status as a smaller reporting company.\nChange in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as discussed above, there have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended August 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Currently, we do not have a right of first refusal pertaining to opportunities that come to their attention and may relate to our business operations.\nOur officers and directors are, so long as they are our officers or directors, subject to the restriction that all opportunities contemplated by our plan of operation which come to their attention, either in the performance of their duties or in any other manner, will be considered opportunities of, and be made available to us and the companies that they are affiliated with on an equal basis. A breach of this requirement will be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the officer or director. If we or the companies with which the officers and directors are affiliated both desires to take advantage of an opportunity, then said officers and directors would abstain from negotiating and voting upon the opportunity.
