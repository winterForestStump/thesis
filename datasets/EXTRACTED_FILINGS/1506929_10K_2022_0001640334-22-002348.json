    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nOverview\nVerde Resources, Inc. (the Company or VRDR) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 22, 2010.\nWe currently operate in two lines of business: (i) gold exploration and mining through Champmark Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian corporation (CSB); and (ii) production and distribution of renewable commodities through Verde Resources (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian corporation. We intend to develop operations in the distribution of THC-free cannabinoid products through Verde Life Inc., an Oregon corporation. The Company is also considering investment opportunities in other non-mining areas including the bioenergy industry and the food & beverage sector.\nThe Company conducts business operations in Pahang Malaysia through Champmark Sdn Bhd (CSB), a private limited liability company incorporated in Malaysia, and a 100% subsidiary Gold Billion Global Limited (GBL), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:\nCorporate History and Structure\nVerde Resources, Inc. was incorporated on April 22, 2010, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A.\nThe following persons were appointed to serve as directors and to assume the responsibilities of officers on October 17, 2013. Mr. Wu Ming Ding, as President and Director; Mr. Balakrishnan B S Muthu as Treasurer Chief Financial Officer, General Manager and Director; and Mr. Liang Wai Keen as Secretary.\nOn October 25, 2013, we entered into an Assignment Agreement For the Assignment of Management Right in Merapoh Gold Mines in Malaysia (Assignment Agreement) with Federal Mining Resources Limited (FMR), a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.\nFMR owned 85% equity interest in CSB, a private limited liability company incorporated in Malaysia. CSB is the Mining Contractor of the Mining Lease for Site IV-1 at the Merapoh Gold Mine under the Contract for Work with MMC Corporation Berhad, the Permit Holder of the Mining Lease.\nUnder the terms of the Assignment Agreement, FMR had assigned its management rights of CSBs mining operation in the Mining Lease to the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Gold Billion Global Limited (GBL), in exchange for 80,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock, which constituted 95.26% of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of and immediately after the consummation of the acquisition.\nGBL was formed on February 7, 2013, by the Board of Directors of FMR to monitor the CSB operation. The acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of GBL was agreed upon on October 18, 2013, and completed on October 25, 2013, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and the audit of GBL.\nPursuant to the Assignment Agreement For The Assignment of Management Right in Merapoh Gold Mines in Malaysia (Assignment Agreement) dated October 25, 2013, and a Supplementary Agreement dated February 17, 2014 on further clarifications to the Assignment Agreement signed by the Company with Federal Mining Resources Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (FMR), the 100% interest of FMR in GBL was transferred to VRDR at a consideration of $1. This transaction was recorded as a reverse acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-40 Reverse Acquisitions. The legal parent was VRDR, which was the accounting acquiree, while GBL was the accounting acquirer. There was a 15% non-controlling interest of CSB after the acquisition. This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein GBL with its 85% deemed subsidiary CSB was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.\nPrior to the acquisition of GBL, on July 1, 2013, FMR had assigned its rights and obligations pursuant to its 85% interest in Champmark Sdn Bhd (CSB) to GBL. According to ASC 810-05-08 A, CSB is a deemed subsidiary of GBL because due to the assignment, GBL had gained control of the Board of Directors of CSB, GBLs rights to receive future benefits and residual value, and GBLs obligation to absorb losses and provide financing for CSB. GBL had the power to direct the activities of CSB that most significantly impact CSBs economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of CSB that could potentially be significant to CSB. Accordingly, GBL was the primary beneficiary of CSB. Under 810-23-42, 43, it was determined that CSB was de-facto agent and GBL, the principal, and consequently, CSB was considered as a deemed subsidiary of GBL beginning July 1, 2013.\nWith the above transactions, GBL became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and CSB, its 85% deemed indirect subsidiary.\nOn April 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of GBL notified Federal Mining Resources Limited (FMR) of the decision to exercise its option to purchase an 85% equity interest of Champmark Sdn Bhd (CSB) pursuant to Section 3.2.4 of the Management Agreement dated July 1, 2013, between GBL and FMR.

The Mine is located in the middle of Malaysias gold metallogenic belt. The central gold belt is the source of the majority of the gold deposits in the peninsula. It lies between the western and eastern tin belts and extends from Kelantan (Sungai Pergau, Sungai Galas) to Pahang (Merapoh, Kuala Lipis, Raub), Terengganu (Lubuk Mandi), Negri Sembilan and Johor (Gunung Ledang).\nMine Area:\nSite IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine consists of a mining area of 400 acres with mining lease.\nLocation and Access:\nThe Merapoh Gold Mine is about 280km from Kuala Lumpur, and 50km from Kuala Lipis, the former state capital of Pahang, accessible via secondary paved highways with a new major highway under construction was completed in 2018/19. The geological coordinates of the mine are 101 \u00b0 58 \u2032 , 4 \u00b0 35 \u2032.\nType of Claim:\nChampmark Sdn Bhd, the subsidiary of Gold Billion Global Limited, is the Mining Contractor of the Mining Lease for Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine under the Contract for Work with MMC Corporation Berhad, the Permit Holder of the Mining Lease.\nIdentifying Information of the Merapoh Gold Mine:\nMining Right:\nMining Lease No.: ML 01/2020\nOperational Mining Scheme No.: PTG.PHG.(ML).16/015/08/23.2019\nConcession Period: From June 14, 2021 to June 13, 2023.\nRegional Geology:\nThe Malaysia Central Gold Belt runs along the entire backbone of Peninsular Malaysia, extending further to the north. It was formed between the Sibumasu block in the west and Manabor block in the east that runs along major mineral deposits in Thailand, Myanmar and China. The regional gold deposits were made of Epithermal deposits that formed in a series of volcanic environment, where the tensional fractures along the subduction zone allows the intrusion of mineral rich acidic magma within deep faults.\nRock Formations and Mineralization:\nSite IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine covers an area of 400 acres with mineralization structure being Permian limestone dominating the South-East portion, felsic volcanic tuff in the Western portion of the area and intrusive dacite rock to the north-west of the area. Tectonic contact within the sheer zone of creates epithermal mineralization, forming a mineral rich vein along the contact zone. The mineralized zone is made of highly altered tuffacaous rock with abundant pyrite dissemination and a moderately spaced quartz vein.\nWork Completed and Present Condition:\nLode gold exploration on Site IV-1 of Merapoh Gold Mine has commenced since 2011 and still in progress with both in-house drilling team and third party drilling services running in parallel to expedite data collection to generate a comprehensive JORC compliant gold reserve report. There was no gold ore extraction since 2019 and the company has been engaged on the sales of wash sand extracted from Site IV-1 of Merapoh Gold Mine to customers in Malaysia from January 2021 to September 2021.\nEquipment, Infrastructure and Other Facilities of the Merapoh Gold Mine:\nParlongs\nThese are basic production plants and the processing method employed five high powered manual water guns, angled water buffering control and 5-lane carpeted sluice with lateral barriers. The processing capacity is between 40 - 45 tons per hour.\nOPS 1\nThis is a modified production plant and the processing method employed four high powered manual water guns, tapered rotating screen scrubber, angled water flow buffering and 3-lane carpeted sluice with lateral barriers. The processing capacity is between 30 - 35 tons per hour.\nGS 150\nThis is a non-self-propelled mobile production plant and the processing method employed fixed spray guns, 6m x 2m rotating screen scrubber, 6-lane carpeted sluice with lateral barriers and conveyer belt pebble dispenser. The processing capacity is between 25 - 30 tons per hour.\nGS 120\nThis is a self-propelled mobile plant with concentrator and the processing method employed fixed spray guns, 4m x 3m rotating screen scrubber, fixed screen, conveyer belt pebble dispenser and triple concentrator processor. The processing capacity is between 15 - 20 tons per hour.\nDescription of Processing Facilities:\nProcess for removing ore concentrates from the ore body\n1.\nThe ore body is transported to the treatment plants in vehicles capable of hauling huge, heavy loads.\n2.\nThe ore body is separated into Ore Type 1 Stockpile and Ore Type 2 Stockpile.\n3.\nThe monitor washes finer gold bearing material off larger rocks which is screened on an inclined coarse wire screen.\n4.\nAn excavator is used to turn over the rocks so wash is removed from all sides of the coarse material.\n5.\nA monitor pushes the rock down the inclined coarse screen where the course is removed and stockpiled at the bottom.\n6.\nFiner material passes through the mesh screen into the sluice system and runs over the sluice.\n7.\nThe carpets are removed and taken to refining facility for gold recovery.\n8.\nA suction pipe recovers water of the fine tailings pond for use in the system.\nRefining of the concentrate\n1.\nThe carpets holding concentrate from the sluice are brought to a shed in the camp site where the gold is refined.\n2.\nThe first stage of the refining is to wash the gold containing concentrate into large bins. This is pumped to a jig and shaking table.\n3.\nNuggets are handpicked from the coarse fraction and the fine fraction is amalgamated to remove the gold. After distillation, gold from the amalgam and the coarse are melted with flux and the gold is poured into small bars.\nCurrent State of Exploration:\nAs of the date of this report, the Merapoh Gold Mine property is without known reserves.\nThe Merapoh Gold Mine commenced exploratory operation in alluvia mining and achieved its first gold pour in July 2011. Through the years of operation, the Company has performed ongoing exercises to improve upon the matching of processing method with the types of ore in order to optimize cost to recovery ratio. In July 2013, production was outsourced to a reputable subcontractor, and developed a resource management system to match ore against processes to achieve the most cost efficient and highest recovery production procedure.\nThere was no gold ore extraction of the Merapoh Gold Mine and no gold concentrate sold for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. We have generated other income from the sales of wash sand to customers in Malaysia.\nOur revenues have been derived from gold production from the Merapoh Gold Mine, but currently there is no production from that mine and we are not certain there will be production in the future. We have generated other revenues through seeking new customers of wash sand sales during January to September 2021. Management continues to search for mining opportunities to generate revenues in the future.\nSubcontractors\nIn an effort to enhance the efficiency of mine operations at the Merapoh Gold Mine, Champmark Sdn Bhd (CSB) entered into an Operation Term Sheet (OTS) agreement in July 2013 to outsource the exploitation works of alluvial gold resources at Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine to a subcontractor Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd (BOG). Throughout the financial years 2022 and 2021, BOG was a related party via its holding company Borneo Oil Berhad, a substantial shareholder of the Company.\nBOG has the experience and local knowledge in managing the exploitation of alluvial gold at the Merapoh Gold Mine. The Company currently intends to continue to outsource the exploitation of alluvial gold at our mine site to BOG and will provide necessary disclosure when any significant agreements have been made with the sub-contractor in the future.\nEmployees\nAs of October 1, 2022, the Company has the following employees:\nSenior Management\nSales and Marketing\nProduction\nInformation System Technology\nAdministration / Finance / HR\nOthers\nTotal\n30 and 8 of our employees are located in Malaysia and the United States, respectively.

The participants are entitled to all of our contributions together with accrued returns regardless of their length of service with the Company.\nThe EPF is a social security institution formed according to the Laws of Malaysia, Employees Provident Fund Act 1991 (Act 452) which provides retirement benefits for members through management of their savings in an efficient and reliable manner. The EPF also provides a convenient framework for employers to meet their statutory and moral obligations to their employees.\nWe intend to hire more staff to assist in the development and execution of our business operations.\nGovernment and Industry Regulations\nThe exploration and development of a mining prospect in Malaysia is subject to regulation by a number of governmental authorities. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining related activities including exploration, mine construction, mineral and ore extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances.\n\u2610\nThe Mineral Development Act of 1994 (MDA) defines the powers of the Federal Government on matters pertaining to the inspection and regulation of mineral exploration, mining and other related issues. The legislation is enforced by the Department of Minerals and Geosciences of Malaysia.\n\u2610\nThe State Mineral Enactment (SME) provides that each State has its own legislation to govern mining activities within its jurisdiction. The State Mineral Enactment provides the States with the powers and rights to issue mineral prospecting and exploration licenses and mining leases and other related matters.\n\u2610\nContinental Shelf Act of 1966 is an Act relating to continental shelf of Malaysia, the exploration thereof and the exploitation of its natural resources. Application of license for mining activities on getting sand from sea-bed is regulated under this Act.\nIn addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.\nMalaysia has not yet enacted regulations specifically for pyrolysis systems. The Company using a pyrolysis system will operate in designated industrial zones and maintain valid operating and trading licenses that may include Environmental Impact Assessments, and inspections by Malaysian government agencies for health & safety such as Bomba.\nInsurance\nInsurance companies in Malaysia offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in Malaysia, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we could face liability from the interruption of our business as summarized under Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We do not carry business interruption insurance so we could incur unrecoverable losses if our business is interrupted.\nCorporate Information\nOur corporate and executive office is located at 2 Cityplace Drive, Suite 200, St. Louis, Missouri 63141, telephone number (323) 538 5799.\nReports to Security Holders\nThe public may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The Company files its reports electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other electronic information regarding New Media and filed with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.\nNear-term Requirements For Additional Capital\nWe believe that we will require approximately $2 million over the next 18 months to implement our business plan. For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business expansion efforts through loans and investments from existing shareholders, financial institutions and investors. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Associated with Verde Resources, Inc.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMessrs. Balakrishnan B S Muthu, our current principal executive officer and financial officer, has extensive contacts and experience in the gold exploration and natural resource industry in Malaysia, and we are dependent upon his abilities and services to develop and market our business. He is responsible for overseeing all of our day-to-day business operations of our operating company, CSB, and its subsidiaries and VIEs, including the mining operations and negotiations for the sales of any gold concentrates extracted. We may not be able to retain the executive officers/managers for any given period of time. The loss of their services could have a material adverse effect upon our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we must attract, recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees in Malaysia to run our mining operations. Our ability to effectively implement our proposed business strategies and expand our operations will depend upon the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and other key personnel in Malaysia. If we cannot maintain highly experienced and skilled management teams, our business could fail and you could lose any investment you make in our shares.\nSince our business consists of managing gold mining projects, the drop in the price of gold would negatively impact our asset values, cash flows, potential revenues and profits.\nWe plan to pursue opportunities in properties with gold mineralized material or reserves with exploration potential. Our potential future revenues are expected to be derived from the production and sale of gold from these properties, or from the sale of some of these properties. The value of any gold reserves or other mineralized materials, and the value of any potential mineral production will vary in direct proportion to changes in those mineral prices. The price of gold has fluctuated widely as a result of numerous factors beyond our control. The effect of these factors on the price of gold and other minerals, and therefore the economic viability of any of our projects, cannot accurately be predicted. Any drop in the price of gold and other minerals we may produce would negatively affect our asset values, cash flows and potential revenues and profits.\nWe may not be able to find commercially viable reserves.\nMineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The reserve estimates, if any, are based only on prefeasibility studies that are inherited with the following drawbacks:\n-\nLimited amount of drilling completed to date;\n-\nThe process testing is limited to small pilot plants and bench scale testing;\n-\nDifficulty in obtaining expected metallurgical recoveries when scaling up to production scale from pilot plant scale;\n-\nPreliminary nature of the mine plans and processing concepts;\n-\nPreliminary nature of operating and capital cost estimates\n-\nMetallurgical flow sheets and recoveries still in development;\n-\nLimited history of prefeasibility studies that might be underestimating capital and operating costs.\nWe cannot assure that any future mineral exploration and development activities will result in any discoveries of proven or probable reserves as defined by the SEC. Further, we cannot provide any assurance that, even if we discover commercial quantities of mineralization, a mineral property will be brought into commercial production. Development of our mineral property will follow only upon obtaining sufficient funding and satisfactory exploration results.\nWe may not be able to successfully compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies.\nWe compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies or individuals, including large, well established mining companies with substantial capabilities and financial resources in Malaysia, to research and acquire rights to mineral properties containing gold and other minerals. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim staking, lease or other acquisition in Malaysia. We do not know if we will be able to successfully acquire any prospective mineral properties against competitors with substantially greater financial resources than we have. If we cannot successfully acquire other mining properties to manage and explore and generally expand our business operations, our results of operations, financial condition and future revenues could be reduced and you could suffer a loss of any investment made in our shares.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, particularly if we were to lose large contracts, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Unless we increase our mining production or secure new sources, we may not be able to meet expenses and our business may fail\nOur production of gold has steadily decreased over the past two years. This is a result of lower production of gold from our mine. Our revenues have been derived from gold production from the Merapoh Gold Mine, but currently there is no production from that mine and we are not certain there will be production in the future. We are also considering acquiring other mining properties to increase our overall production and income. However, if we are not successful in increasing production, either through new methods at our exiting mine, or by securing rights at other gold properties, we may not have sufficient revenues to maintain our business, and our business may fail.\nImpact of recent COVID-19 outbreak has increased uncertainty of our business operation\nThe recent COVID-19 has affected our operation in Malaysia as the government announced stringent restrictions to lock down the country to stop further outbreak of the COVID-19 transmission. Many governmental departments that the company have dealing with are closed and not accepting new application. That has caused delay for the company in obtaining new mining lease. The Malaysia Government Movement Control Order has also disrupted our planning and allocation of our workforce.\nImpact of current global economic climate has increased uncertainty of our future operations\nImpact of changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, has increased uncertainty of our business operations.\nChanges in global economic conditions, including inflation which resulted in lower consumer confidence, may continue to have negative impact on our business, revenues and earnings. Inflation rates have increased and may continue to rise. Our suppliers may continue to raise prices that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. This may continue to affect our business, including our competitive position, market share, revenues and profit margins.\nWe are subject to the many risks of doing business internationally, including but not limited to the difficulty of enforcing liabilities in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are a Nevada corporation and, as such, are subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Nevada and the United States courts for purposes of any lawsuit, action or proceeding by investors. An investor would have the ability to effect service of process in any action against the Company within the United States. In addition, we are registered as a foreign corporation doing business in Malaysia, and as such, are subject to the local laws of Malaysia governing an investors ability to bring actions in foreign courts and enforce liabilities against a foreign private issuer, or any person, based on U.S. federal securities laws.\nInvestors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in Malaysia based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.\nSome of our current operations are conducted in Malaysia, and some of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of Malaysia and other foreign countries. All or substantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in other foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside Malaysia upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of Malaysia would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Malaysia against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. Our executive officers and employees have not been subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prior to 2010. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMining risks and insurance could negatively effect on our profitability.\nThe business of mining for gold is generally subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, labor disputes, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, pressures, cave-ins, changes in the regulatory environment, and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods, blizzards and earthquakes. At the present time, we have in effect statutory required social insurance for all employees and mine workers. There is currently no other insurance in place for the mining site and management, and, even if we were to purchase additional insurance, we cannot be sure that such insurance would be available to us, or that we could afford the premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. In addition, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms. We might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we may not be insured against, or which we may elect not to insure against, because of premium costs or other reasons. Any losses from any of these events may cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations, which could negatively impact any investment you make in our shares.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nMalaysian companies may not always adopt a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in Malaysia. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards for foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we may experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firms attestation to or report on managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nOur independent registered auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur audited financial statements included in this report include an explanatory paragraph that indicates that they were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. We have suffered recurring net losses, and record an accumulated deficits as of June 30, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plan for continuing as a going concern included improving our profitability, and obtaining additional debt financing, loans from existing directors and shareholders and private placements of capital stock for additional funding to meet our operating needs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and fair value of net assets.\nOur investment activities and credit guarantee activities expose us to interest rate and other market risks. Changes in interest rates, up or down, could adversely affect our net interest yield. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, either can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest yield to expand or compress. For example, due to the timing of maturities or rate reset dates on variable-rate instruments, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets. This rate change could cause our net interest yield to compress until the effect of the increase is fully reflected in asset yields. Changes in the slope of the yield curve could also reduce our net interest yield.\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, such as the Federal Reserve. Federal Reserve policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. The availability of derivative financial instruments (such as options and interest rate and foreign currency swaps) from acceptable counterparties of the types and in the quantities needed could also affect our ability to effectively manage the risks related to our investment funding. Our strategies and efforts to manage our exposures to these risks may not be effective in the future, which could negatively impact our results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nWe may be exposed to risks relating to managements conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective.\nWe do not have an independent audit committee and our Board of Directors may be unable to fulfill the functions of such a committee, which may compromise the management of our business. Our Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of two directors, none of whom are considered to be independent in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessment of the Companys processes relating to its risks and control environment, oversight of financial reporting, and evaluation of internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committees responsibilities, which could compromise the management of our business.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nMalaysian companies may not always adopt a Western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. In addition, we may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in Malaysia. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards for foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we may experience difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could impact the reliability of our financial statements and prevent us from complying with SEC rules and regulations and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firms attestation to or report on managements assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nOur former auditor is not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and as such, our investors are deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nAs a public company with securities quoted on the OTQB, we are required to have our financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB. A requirement of being registered with the PCAOB is that if requested by the SEC or PCAOB, such accounting firm is required to make its audits and related audit work papers be subject to regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Since our former auditor is located in Hong Kong and China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities due to various state secrecy laws and the revised Securities Law, the PCAOB currently does not have free access to inspect the work of our auditor. This lack of the PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of our former auditor.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOur shares are defined as penny stock. The rules imposed on the sale of the shares may affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.\nOur shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock, and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase.\nMarket for penny stock has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse\nStockholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:\nControl of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;\nManipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\nBoiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons;\nExcessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and,\nThe wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses.\nOur management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nInability and unlikelihood to pay dividends\nTo date, we have not paid, nor do we intend to pay in the foreseeable future, dividends on our common stock, even if we become profitable. Earnings, if any, are expected to be used to advance our activities and for general corporate purposes, rather than to make distributions to stockholders. Prospective investors will likely need to rely on an increase in the price of Company stock to profit from his or her investment. There are no guarantees that any market for our common stock will ever develop or that the price of our stock will ever increase.\nSince we are not in a financial position to pay dividends on our common stock and future dividends are not presently being contemplated, investors are advised that return on investment in our common stock is restricted to an appreciation in the share price. The potential or likelihood of an increase in share price is questionable at best. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur corporate and executive office is located at 2 Cityplace Drive, Suite 200, St. Louis, Missouri 63141, telephone number (323) 538-5799. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current requirements.\nWe own or lease the following real properties:\nLocation\nRent/Own\nMortgage/Lease Terms\nUse\nLa Belle\nLease #\nNA\nFactory Site\nSt. Louis Missouri\nLease\nExpires May 1, 2023\nCorporate Headquarters\nChesterfield, Missouri\nOwn\nNA\nCorporate Housing\nJalan Silam, Sabah Malaysia\nRent\nNA\nFactory Site\nPahang, Malaysia\nLease\nExpires June 13, 2023\nMerapoh Gold Mine\n# - Exercised Option to Purchase on September 27, 2022 and accordingly became an owned property. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNone Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nPursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ( Dodd-Frank Act ), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic and annual reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities under the regulation of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The Company did not have any mines in the United States during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is now quoted on the OTCQB, under the symbol VRDR. Our stock was approved for quotation on the OTCBB on September 26, 2012. However, the Companys common stock did not begin active trading until October 2013.\nThe following table sets forth the high and low bid prices for our common stock per quarter as reported by the OTCBB for the most recent two (2) fiscal years, based on our fiscal year end June 30, 2022. These prices represent quotations between dealers without adjustment for retail mark-up, markdown or commission, and may not represent actual transactions.\nFiscal Quarter Ended\nHigh\nLow\nJune 30, 2021\n$ 0.14\n$ 0.02\nSeptember 30, 2021\n$ 0.08\n$ 0.045\nDecember 31, 2021\n$ 0.04\n$ 0.01\nMarch 31, 2022\n$ 1.00\n$ 0.01\nJune 30, 2022\n$ 0.14\n$ 0.02\nSeptember 30, 2022\n$ 0.08\n$ 0.045\nAs of October 12, 2022, we had 108 shareholders of record of our common stock and 820,688,055 shares issued and outstanding.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and have no present intention of paying any dividends on the shares of our common stock. Our current policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our operations and in the development of our business. Our future dividend policy will be determined from time to time by our board of directors.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nWe did not sell any equity securities which were not registered under the Securities Act during the year ended June 30, 2022, that were not otherwise disclosed on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K filed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 except the following transaction.:\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company announced the Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire the assets of biofraction plant and the right to use intellectual property license in Sabah, Malaysia from Borneo Energy Sdn Bhd, in consideration of issuance of 166,666,667 share of the Companys stock at $0.03 per share, valued at $5,000,000. 135,666,667 shares and 31,000,000 shares were issued on May 10, 2021 and July 1, 2021, respectively. The completion of the S&P Agreement is subject to all such acts necessary, including but not limited to due diligence exercise to ascertain the valuation of the assets of the biofraction plant and the right to use the licensed intellectual property in Sabah, Malaysia.\nThe Company also announced the Share Sale Agreement on May 12, 2021 for the acquisition of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of Bio Resources Limited with Taipan International Limited, an unrelated third party, The Wision Project Limited (formerly known as Borneo Resources Limited), an unrelated third party, and other unrelated third party individuals, in consideration of issuance of 321,500,000 shares of the Companys restricted common stock at $0.03 per share, valued at $9,645,000, and the issuance of promissory notes with two-year term period with a principal amount of $20,355,000. 321,500,000 shares were issued on May 12, 2021 and the promissory notes were issued on May 12, 2021. The face value (principal) amount of $20,355,000 is repayable by May 12, 2023, and bearing zero coupon interest. The promissory note is priced at $16,290,550 considering the current market interest rate. However, on January 20, 2022, the Company reached a mutual agreement to enter into a Supplement to Promissory Note with each of the 17 lenders (Lenders) of the promissory notes that were issued on May 12, 2021, to convert the total principal loan amount of $20,355,000 into shares of the Companys restricted common stock priced at $0.0611 per share, which represents the last ninety (90) days volume weighted average price (VWAP) as of the market closing of January 19, 2022. The Company and the Lenders further agreed that the actual date for the allotment and issue of new shares of the Companys restricted common stock shall be confirmed in a subsequent written agreement. The acquisition of Bio Resourced Limited was closed on October 12, 2022.\nOn April 25, 2022, the Company issued a total of 8,445,946 restricted common shares for $1,000,000 at $0.1184 per share to two non-US shareholders.\nPurchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nWe did not purchase any of our shares of common stock or other securities during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Item 6. [Reserved]. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report, particularly in the section entitled Risk Factors of this annual report.\nOur audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table provides selected financial data about our company for the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.\nStatement of Operation\nJune 30,\nChange\nUSD\nUSD\nUSD\n%\nRevenue\n$ 38,169\n$ -\n38,169\n$ 100 %\nCost of revenue\n(145,356 )\n-\n(145,356 )\n100 %\nGross loss\n(107,187 )\n-\n(107,187 )\n100 %\nOperating expenses\n(1,905,301 )\n(574,174 )\n(1,331,127 )\n231.8 %\nGoodwill impairment\n(4,879 )\n-\n(4,879 )\n100.0 %\nLoss from operation\n(2,017,367 )\n(574,174 )\n(1,443,193 )\n251.4 %\nInterest expense\n(1,949,151 )\n(245,392 )\n(1,703,759 )\n694.3 %\nOther income\n12,104\n26,559\n(14,455 )\n(54.4 )%\nNet loss before income tax\n(3,954,414 )\n(793,007 )\n(3,161,407 )\n398.7 %\nProvision of Income Tax\n-\n-\nNET LOSS\n(3,954,414 )\n(793,007 )\n(3,161,407 )\n398.7 %\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n6,979\n18,158\n(11,179 )\n(61.6 )%\nNet loss attributable to shareholders of the group\n$ (3,947,435 )\n$ (774,849 )\n(3,172,586 )\n409.4 %\nRevenue\nThe revenue derived from the sales production and distribution of renewable commodities of gold mineral to customers in Malaysia.

No cost of revenue was incurred during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses comprised mainly of salaries, office costs, legal and professional fees and travelling expenses. We have incurred $1,905,301 and $574,174 in operating expenses through June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. Operating expenses increased by 231.8%, or $1,331,127, primarily due to increase of professional fees charged for the potential acquisition and increase of directors emolument for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nInterest expense\nThe Company recorded interest expense of $1,948,086 and $245,392 on the promissory notes for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease interest amounted to $1,065 and $0 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOther income\nWe have other income of $12,104 and $26,559 for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. We generated other income from the sales of wash sand to customers in Malaysia since January 2021 to September 2021.\nNet loss\nWe recorded a net loss of $3,954,414 and $793,007 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPlan of Operation\nOur Industry and Principal Markets\nThe report by BMI Research states that global gold mine output growth will pick up in the next few years, supported by higher gold prices and solid projects in key countries. BMI Research forecasts global gold production to increase from 105moz in 2018 to 125moz by 2026, averaging 2.3% annual growth. While a steady pace of growth, this represents a slight deceleration in growth rate compared with the previous eight-year average of 3.1%.\nSubcontractor\nIn an effort to enhance the efficiency of mine operations at the Merapoh Gold Mine, Champmark Sdn Bhd (CSB) entered into an Operation Term Sheet (OTS) agreement in July 2013, to outsource the exploitation works of alluvial gold resources at Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine to subcontractor, Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd (BOG), who throughout the financial years 2022 and 2021 was a related party via its holding company Borneo Oil Berhad, a substantial shareholder of the Company..\nBOG has the experience and local knowledge in managing the exploitation of alluvial gold at the Merapoh Gold Mine. The Company currently intends to continue to outsource the exploitation of alluvial gold at our mine site to BOG and will provide necessary disclosure when any significant agreements have been made with the sub-contractor in the future.\nExpansion Plans\nThe Company is in the process of negotiating with Malaysia state agency PKNP on a 2-year lease for a new mining location that is about 5 km from the current Merapoh mine site. The leasing premium has been paid but the mining lease certificate will only be issued upon clearance from the Malaysia Forest Department, which is expected in mid 2023 subject to review on COVID-19 Movement Control Order by the Malaysian government.\nFor the current Site IV-1 of the Merapoh Gold Mine, our mining operation would focus on mining other resources such as limestones.\nThe Company believes that there are excellent growth opportunities for its business outside Malaysia. We are constantly exploring for potential acquisition of mining projects in other parts of the world.\nAs our business is affected by the fluctuations of gold prices, the Company intends to diversify its product line by acquiring mining projects with potential for different mineral resources other than gold. We continue to hold discussions with other mining companies for potential collaboration to carry out exploration and exploitation works on other mineral resources in Southeast Asia regions. Apart from the mining industry, the Company is taking steps to look into investment opportunities in the non-mining areas that include the bioenergy industry and the food & beverage sector.\nThe Company is diversifying into the green industry with its acquisition of Bio Resources Ltd (BRL), the beneficial and/or registered proprietor of the intellectual property known as Catalytic Biofraction Process, which is a slow pyrolysis process using a proprietary catalyst to depolymerise palm biomass wastes (empty fruit bunches or palm kernel shells) in temperature range of 350 degC to 500 degC to yield commercially valuable bio products: bio-oil, wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid), biochar and bio-syngas. The intellectual property is a second-generation pyrolysis process where non-food feedstock like the palm biomass wastes is used as feedstock.\nApart from the green industry, the Company is also working on a partnership with MRX Technologies, a market leader in commercial extraction systems for cannabis and hemp. The partnership includes an agreement for Verde Resources to white-label THC-free CBD products from MRX Technologies.\nLimited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital\nThere is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services.\nWe have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from private placements. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on the sale of our products, which are still under development stage. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $0.4 million as of June 30, 2022, and $2.1 million as of June 30, 2021\nThe following table provides selected cash flow data about our company for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nCash Flow Date\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$ (1,595,961 )\n$ (126,011 )\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$ (1,348,823 )\n$ (905,575 )\nNet cash generated from financing activities\n$ 989,594\n$ 3,100,000\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n$ 256,485\n$ 25,181\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$ (1,698,705 )\n$ 2,093,595\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n$ 2,117,622\n$ 24,027\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n$ 418,917\n$ 2,117,622\nNet Cash Used In Operating Activities.\nCash used in operating activities reflects net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, asset impairments, and stock-based compensation, and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher net loss adjusted for non-cash interest expense of promissory notes and the increase of other deposits and prepayments.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $1.1 million of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of $0.9 million from the payment of acquisition of equity interest, right of use assets and property and equipment.\nNet Cash Generated From Financing Activities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash generated from financing activities included $1.0 million for the issuance of our common stock under private placement.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, net cash generated from financing activities included $3.1 million for the issuance of our common stock under private placement.\nThe cash flow situation will not allow for operations in the coming next 12 months by self-generated cash provided from operating activities. The Company needs to increase cash flow supplies with a long-term plan until the Company makes sustainable profits and has a positive cash flow. Otherwise, loans from related parties may be a temporary solution, although we have no written loan agreements. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure adequate financing. If we fail to secure sufficient funds, our business activities may be curtailed, or we may cease to operate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company has generated recurring losses and suffered from an accumulated deficit of $10,357,920 as of June 30, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current year audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements.\nWe determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ J&S Associate\nCertified Public Accountants\nFirm ID: 6743\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nNovember 4, 2022\n\u4e2d\u6b63\u9054\u6703\u8a08\u5e2b\u4e8b\u52d9\u6240\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.Certified Public Accountants (Practising)\nUnit 1304, 13/F., Two Harbourfront, 22 Tak Fung Street, Hunghom, Hong Kong\n\u9999\u6e2f\u7d05\u78e1\u5fb7\u8c50\u885722\u865f\u6d77\u6ff1\u5ee3\u5834\u4e8c\u671f13\u6a131304\u5ba4\nTel : (852) 2126 2388 Fax: (852) 2122 9078\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo:\nThe board of directors and stockholders of\nVerde Resources, Inc. (the Company)\nOpinion of the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Verde Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at June 30, 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nConsideration of the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring net losses, and records an accumulated deficits as of June 30, 2021. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nBasis of Presentation and Going Concern - Disclosure\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit from recurring net losses as of June 30, 2021. The Company has contractual obligations such as commitments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment, and subsidiaries and promissory notes (collectively obligations). Currently managements forecasts and related assumptions illustrate their ability to meet the obligations through management of expenditures and, if necessary, obtaining additional debt financing, loans from existing directors and shareholders and private placements of capital stock for additional funding to meet its operating needs. Should there be constraints on the ability to access such financing, the Company can manage cash outflows to meet the obligations through reductions in capital expenditures and other operating expenditures.\nWe identified managements assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter. Management made judgments to conclude that it is probable that the Companys plans will be effectively implemented and will provide the necessary cash flows to fund the Companys obligations as they become due. Specifically, the judgments with the highest degree of impact and subjectivity in determining it is probable that the Companys plans will be effectively implemented included its ability to reduce capital expenditures and other operating expenditures, its ability to access funding from the capital market and its ability to obtaining loans from existing directors and shareholders. Auditing the judgments made by management required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included the following, among others: (i) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to access funding from the capital market; (ii) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to reduce capital expenditures and other operating expenditures if required and (iii) evaluating the probability that the Company will be able to obtain the loan from existing directors and shareholders.\n/s/ Centurion ZD CPA & Co.\nCenturion ZD CPA & Co.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014 to 2022.\nHong Kong, China\nNovember 12, 2021\nVERDE RESOURCES,

Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.\nIdentified below are the accounting policies that reflect the Companys most significant estimates and judgments, and those that the Company believes are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate its consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\u00b7\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Verde Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.\n\u00b7\nSegment Reporting\nAccounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Companys internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in consolidated financial statements. Currently, the Company operates in four reportable operating segments.\n\u00b7\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nThe Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Companys management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.\n\u00b7\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company operates in the resource exploration industry that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource exploration business and venturing into new biofraction and CBD product industries, including the potential risk of business failure.\n\u00b7\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had $418,917 and $2,117,622 in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAt and June 30, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits in a Malaysian bank and petty cash on hands.\n\u00b7\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are recognized and carried at net realizable value. An allowance for doubtful accounts will be recorded in the period when a loss is probable based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating troubled collection, historical experience, accounts aging, ongoing business relation and other factors. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. If accounts receivable are to be provided for, or written off, they would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within operating expenses. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has no allowance for doubtful accounts, as per managements judgment based on their best knowledge. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the longest credit term for certain customers are 60 days.\n\u00b7\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value (net realizable value), cost being determined on a first-in-first-out method. Costs include material, labor and overhead costs. The Company provides inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined principally by customer demand.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record an allowance for obsolete inventories, nor have there been any write-offs.\n\u00b7\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after taking into account their estimated residual values:\nExpected useful life\nLand and buildings\n3-27.5 years\nPlant and machinery\n5-7years\nOffice equipment\n3 years\nProject equipment\n5 years\nComputer\n5 years\nMotor vehicle\n5 years\nFurniture & fittings\n5 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterment which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income in other income or expenses.\n\u00b7\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, all long-lived assets such as property and equipment owned and held by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nRevenue Recognition\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entitys contracts to provide goods or services to customers.\nThe Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfils its obligations under each of its agreements:\n\u2219\nidentify the contract with a customer;\n\u2219\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2219\ndetermine the transaction price;\n\u2219\nallocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2219\nrecognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer that obtains control of the product and collection is reasonably assured. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. Most of the Companys contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer products or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct.\nProduct sales\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Companys product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nRevenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Companys customers.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, returns and rebates. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the amount is payable to the Companys customer.\nGold mining\nRevenue from the sales of gold mineral or other minerals to registered gold trading companies or other customers in Malaysia is recognized as revenue in accordance with the following core principles: at the time of gold or minerals sales, the contract with customers and the performance obligations are identified. The transaction and selling price is determined by the prevailing market value of gold bullion quoted by the leading registered gold trading company in Malaysia or at an agreed price. Sales invoice will be prepared to reflect the proper transaction price based on the performance obligation allocation. After delivery is completed and the performance obligation is satisfied, sales invoice will be presented to the customers and so revenue is then recognized accordingly.\n\u00b7\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the operating lease, the Company generally uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU assets) assets represent the Companys right to control the use of an identified asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are generally recognized based on the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nROU assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. ROU assets from operating and finance leases are subject to the impairment guidance in ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as ROU assets are long-lived nonfinancial assets.\nROU assets are tested for impairment individually or as part of an asset group if the cash flows related to the ROU asset are not independent from the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An asset group is the unit of accounting for long-lived assets to be held and used, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities.\nThe Company recognized no impairment of ROU assets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nThe operating lease is included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nLeases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership to the lessee, other than legal title, are accounted for as finance leases. Substantially all of the risks or benefits of ownership are deemed to have been transferred if any one of the four criteria is met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lease containing a bargain purchase option, (iii) the lease term exceeding 75% of the estimated economic life of the leased asset, (iv) the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeding 90% of the fair value. At the inception of a finance lease, we as the lessee records an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life if title does not transfer to us, while the leased asset is depreciated in accordance with our depreciation policy if the title is to eventually transfer to us. The periodic rent payments made during the lease term are allocated between a reduction in the obligation and interest element using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 842.\n\u00b7\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company adopted the ASC Topic 740, Income tax provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\n\u00b7\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the ASC Topic 740 provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\n\u00b7\nForeign Currencies Translation\nThe Companys reporting currency is the United States dollar (US$) and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in United States dollars. The Companys functional currency is the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) which is a functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFor reporting purposes, in accordance with ASC Topic 830 Translation of Financial Statements, capital accounts of the consolidated financial statements are translated into United States dollars from MYR at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of balance sheet date. Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate of the respective year. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements subsidiaries to the reporting currency are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statements of changes in stockholders equity.\nTranslation of MYR into U.S. dollars has been made at the following exchange rates for the following periods:-\nJune 30, 2022\nJune 30, 2021\nYear-end MYR:US$ exchange rate\n4.40773\n4.15110\nAnnualized average MYR:US$ exchange rate\n4.23181\n4.11692\n\u00b7\nComprehensive Income\nASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity, consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Company accounts for noncontrolling interest in accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-45, which requires the Company to present noncontrolling interests as a separate component of total shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\u00b7\nNet Loss per Share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed similar to basic income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\n\u00b7\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are based on estimated fair values. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period.\nThe Company accounts for non-employee stock-based awards at fair value in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.\n\u00b7\nRetirement Plan Costs\nContributions to retirement plans (which are defined contribution plans) are charged to general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operation as the related employee service are provided.\n\u00b7\nMineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs\nMineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves.\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nThe operations of the Company have been, and may in the future, be affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Companys policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible measures.\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of expenditures incurred since inception have been charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries.\n\u00b7\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows the ASC 850-10, Related Party for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nThe consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\n\u00b7\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows the ASC 450-20, Commitments to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\n\u00b7\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below:\nLevel 1\nQuoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2\nPricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3\nPricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, loan and fee receivable, prepayments and other receivables, amounts due from related parties, accrued liabilities and other payables, loans payable, amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n\u00b7\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2020-06 - Debt - Debt with conversion and other options (subtopic 470-20) and derivatives and hedging - contracts in entitys own equity (subtopic 815-40): accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entitys own equity. The amendments in this update are intended to simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. The ASU is part of the FASBs simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in U.S. GAAP. For public business entities that are not smaller reporting companies, the ASUs amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance may be early adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective July 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, there have been no new, or existing, recently issued accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance, that impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company has generated recurring losses and suffered from an accumulated deficit of $10,357,920 as of June 30, 2022. The continuation of the Company as a going concern in the next twelve months is dependent upon the Company's success in pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.\nThe ability of the Company to survive is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings, and related party loans.\nNo assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nThese and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 4 - BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nCurrently, the Company has four reportable business segments:\n(i)\nGold mineral mining;\n(ii)\nDistribution of THC-free cannabinoid (CBD) products, mainly operates;\n(iii)\nProduction and distribution of renewable commodities; and\n(iv)\nReal property holding\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by primary major product line, and timing of revenue recognition.

This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified fixed asset explicitly or implicitly for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed if we obtain the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the underlying asset. Some of our leases include both lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component as the Company has elected the practical expedient. Some of the operating lease agreements include variable lease costs, primarily taxes, insurance, common area maintenance or increases in rental costs related to inflation. Substantially all of our equipment leases and some of our real estate leases have terms of less than one year and, as such, are accounted for as short-term leases as we have elected the practical expedient.\nOperating leases are included in the right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at each leases commencement date based on the present values of its lease payments over its respective lease term. When a borrowing rate is not explicitly available for a lease, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on information available at the leases commencement date to determine the present value of its lease payments. Operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company adopts a 5% as weighted average incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The weighted average remaining life of the lease was 3 years.\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet.\nAs of June 30,\nAssets\nRight-of-use asset #\n$\n685,714\n$\n60,131\nLiabilities\nCurrent:\nFinance lease liabilities\n$ 75,224\n$ -\nNon-current:\nFinance lease liabilities\n97,900\n-\nTotal lease liabilities\n$ 173,124\n$ -\nVERDE RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nAs of June 30, 2022, right-of-use assets were $685,714 and lease liabilities were $173,124.\nAs of June 30, 2021, right-of-use assets were $60,131 and lease liabilities were $0.\nThe Company excludes short-term leases (those with lease terms of less than one year at inception) from the measurement of lease liabilities or right-of-use assets.

These reports were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that the report contained an explanatory paragraph stating that there was substantial doubt about Verdes ability to continue as a going concern.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and in the subsequent interim period through March 31, 2022, there were no disagreements (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between CZD and Verde on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of CZD, would have caused CZD to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in connection with their reports. Furthermore, no reportable events occurred during the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, or subsequently up to March 30, 2022. As used herein, the term reportable event means any of the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K.\nDuring the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 and in the subsequent periods through March 31, 2022, neither Verde nor anyone on its behalf consulted J&S regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction (either completed or proposed), or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Verde's consolidated financial statements, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). During the 2021, the Company has been undertaking tremendous changes and expansion which rendered the management to re-consider the available of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation under the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of June 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. During the 2022, the Company has been undertaking tremendous enlargement and expansion which rendered the management to re-consider the available of more management talents and professional staff to meet the enlargement in operation during and after the coming acquisition and expansion move. Based on this consideration and that evaluation, the current management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by three individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officers in connection with the review of our financial statements as of June 30, 2022.\nManagement believes that the material weaknesses set forth above may have an immediate negative effect on our financial results because of our enlargement of operation. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements if the Company were growing substantially after the expansion move was materialized.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. With the participation of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on the COSO framework criteria because of the enlargement in operation. The management acknowledged that there is room for further improvement in maintaining effective internal control and shall take steps to implement managements remediation initiatives during and after that expansion, This includes recruiting more management talents and professional staff, committing the entire organization to allocate necessary organizational resources, and cross-functional collaboration focused on strengthening the companys quality systems and operating culture.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn order to cure the foregoing material weakness, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures:\n-\nWe have been working on recruitment of more management talents and professional staff to fill in the gap of shortage of personnel under enlargement of operation during and after this expansion move. With the enlargement of operation, the management needs to re-consider and re-evaluate the entire internal control reporting system and related risk and changes.\n-\nWe have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. Also, we have regularly provided trainings to our financial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant personnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements.\nWe intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weakness that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation, as needed.\nOfficers Certifications\nAppearing as exhibits to this Annual Report are Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nOur executive compensation philosophy is to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive compensation program is designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executives career with us. The compensation program objectives are to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. The compensation package of our named executive officers consists of two main elements:\n1.\nbase salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and\n2.\ndiscretionary bonus awards payable in cash or equity and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives.\nProcess for Setting Executive Compensation\nUntil such time as we establish a Compensation Committee, our Board is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. We expect to annually review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the executives compensation. We process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, we expect to review and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers.\nThe Chief Executive Officer periodically provides the Board with an evaluation of each named executive officers performance, based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors. The Board provides an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives.\nOur Compensation Peer Group\nWe currently engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels.\nProgram Components\nOur executive compensation program consists of the following elements:\nBase Salary\nOur base salary structure is designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer reflects our past and current operating profits, the named executive officers individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board considers all of these factors, though it does not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board generally reviews the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market.\nDiscretionary Bonus\nThe objectives of our bonus awards are to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that success.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following summary compensation table sets forth the aggregate compensation we paid or accrued during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 to (i) our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), (ii) our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), (iii) our three most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer who were serving as executive officers on June 30, 2021, whose total compensation was in excess of $100,000, and (iv) up to two additional individuals who would have been within the two-other-most-highly compensated but were not serving as executive officers on June 30, 2021.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nName and Principal Position\nYear\nSalary\n($)\nBonus\n($)\nStock Awards\n($)\nOption Awards\n($)\nNon-Equity Incentive\nPlan Compensation ($)\nChange in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings\n($)\nAll Other Compensation ($)\nTotal\n($)\nBalakrishnan B S Muthu (1)\nPresident, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, General Manager, and Director\n60,547\n60,547\nPresident, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, General Manager, and Director\n66,338\n62,857\n129,195\nChen Ching (2)\nDirector\n24,000\n24,000\nDirector\n77,858\n77,858\nCarl M.

Based on this assessment, we concluded that our policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash bonuses for punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations (with modifications to comply with local regulations as appropriate). The risk-mitigating factors considered in this assessment included:\n\u00b7\nthe alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amounts relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and\n\u00b7\neffective balance of cash, short- and long-term performance periods, caps on performance-based award schedules and financial metrics with individual factors and Board and management discretion.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nWe do not currently have a compensation committee and, for the year ended June 30, 2022, the compensation, if any, of our executive officers was recommended by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and such recommendations were approved by our board of directors. None of our executive officers currently serves as a member of the compensation committee or as a director with compensation duties of any entity that has executive officer serving on our board of directors. None of our executive officers has served in such capacity in the past 12 months.\nCompensation Committee Report\nOur Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this report with management.
