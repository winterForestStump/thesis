    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nOaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, where applicable, the \"Company\", which may also be referred to as \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") is structured as a closed-end investment company focused on lending to small-and medium-sized companies. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (a \"BDC\") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the \"Investment Company Act\") and have elected to be treated, and to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the \"Code\").\nWe were formed on April 30, 2018 as a Delaware corporation and are externally managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\" or \"Oaktree\"). Oaktree is an affiliate of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\"OCM\"), the Company's external investment adviser through May 11, 2020, and a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC (\"OCG\"). In 2019, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (\"Brookfield\") acquired a majority economic interest in OCG. OCG operates as an independent business within Brookfield, with its own product offerings and investment, marketing and support teams. Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC (the Administrator), a subsidiary of OCM, provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We seek to achieve our investment objective without subjecting principal to undue risk of loss by investing primarily in situations where a company or its owners (a) are overleveraged or facing pressures to recapitalize, (b) are unable to access broadly syndicated capital markets, (c) are undervalued after having recently exited bankruptcy or completed a restructuring or (d) are otherwise affected by mispricings or inefficiencies in the capital markets or at different points throughout the credit cycle. See \" Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a number of significant risks. In addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us might also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our Net Asset Value and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. The risk factors described below are the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us as well as those factors generally associated with an investment company with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to ours.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us:\nOur current and future investments in distressed or bankrupt companies are subject to significant risks - We have acquired, and may in the future opportunistically acquire the securities and obligations of distressed companies, including opportunistic acquisitions during the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments in distressed companies are subject to significant risks, including lack of income, extraordinary expenses, uncertainty with respect to satisfaction of debt, lower-than-expected investment values or income potentials and resale restrictions.\nUncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition -Changes in interest rates, changes in the method for determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and the eventual replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our cost of capital and net investment income.\nOur investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or parts of our investments - Middle-market companies in which we primarily invest, as compared with larger companies, may have more limited financial resources, less predictable operating results, greater exposure to economic downturns and limited operating histories, and, for many of our investments, the portfolio companies are highly leveraged and there is little or no publicly available information about them, and our investments in such companies are not rated by any rating agency.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities - We may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as a result of competition with other investors.\nA significant portion of our portfolio securities do not have a readily available market price and, as a result, valuations of our portfolio involve uncertainties and subjective determinations - Our portfolio securities typically do not have a readily available market price and, in such a case, we value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser under procedures adopted by our board of directors, which valuation is inherently subjective and may not reflect what we may actually realize from the sale of the investment.\nWe are dependent upon our Adviser for future success - Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends in substantial part on the management, skill and acumen of our Adviser. If our Adviser were to lose key personnel or were to resign, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly impeded.\nOur Adviser may face conflicts of interest - Conflicts of interest may exist from time to time between our Adviser and certain of its affiliates involved with us, which could impact our investment returns.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations - We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested, and each of our investments is pledged as collateral under one or more of our credit facilities, which may increase the risk of investing in us.\nThere are risks related to the Mergers that could adversely affect us or our stockholders. Stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the consideration they will receive in connection with the Mergers until the closing date of the Mergers. OCSL may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the Mergers, including estimated cost savings, or it may take longer than anticipated to achieve such benefits. The Mergers may not be consummated, which may have a negative impact on our business.\nGeneral economic and market conditions, including those caused by inflation and a rising interest rate environment, could materially affect the success of our activities and investments. Unfavorable economic conditions\ncould increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us, and market conditions (including inflation, supply chain issues and decreased consumer demand) have adversely impacted, and could in the future further impact, the operations of certain of our portfolio companies.\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability - Economic recessions or downturns, changes in regulations or regulatory interpretations thereof, transitions of government, and uncertainty regarding any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could impair the ability of our portfolio companies to repay debt or pay interest.\nRisks Relating to Our Investments\nWe invest primarily in privately owned small- and medium-sized companies, which involve a number of significant risks.\nWe invest primarily in privately owned small- and medium-sized companies. Investments in these types of companies pose a number of significant risks. For example, such companies: (a) have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress; (b) may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under the debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment; (c) may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns; (d) are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the portfolio company and, in turn, on us; (e) may have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in volatile businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position; and (f) are not subject to the Exchange Act and other regulations that govern public companies, and therefore provide little information to the public. In addition, we, our Adviser, its affiliates and their directors, executive management team and members and the Investment Professionals may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in such portfolio companies.\nAlso, investments in such companies tend to be less liquid. See - We invest in illiquid investments and may experience difficulty in selling those investments in a timely manner at the price that we believe the investments are worth.\nFinally, as noted above, little public information generally exists about privately owned companies, and these companies often do not have third-party debt ratings or audited financial statements. Stockholders, therefore, must rely on the ability of the Adviser to obtain adequate information through due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness and potential returns from investing in these companies. Additionally, these companies and their financial information will not generally be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. If the Adviser is unable to uncover all material information about these companies, it may not make a fully informed investment decision, and stockholders may lose money on our investments.\nOur investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or parts of our investments.\nThe companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies are not rated by any rating agency. If such investments were rated, we believe that they would likely receive a rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization of below investment grade (i.e., below BBB- or Baa), which is often referred to as \"high yield\" and \"junk.\" Exposure to below investment grade securities involves certain risks, and those securities are viewed as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Investing in small and mid-sized companies involves a number of significant risks. Securities in the lower-rated categories and comparable non-rated securities are subject to greater risk of loss of principal and interest than higher-rated and comparable non-rated securities and are generally considered to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Such issuers typically are highly leveraged, with significant burdens on cash flow and, therefore, involve a high degree of financial risk. During an economic downturn or recession, securities of financially troubled or operationally troubled issuers are more likely to go into default than securities of other issuers. Because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with the lower-rated and comparable non-rated securities, the yields and prices of such securities may be more volatile than those for higher-rated and comparable non-rated securities. The market for lower-rated and comparable non-rated securities is thinner, often less liquid and less active than that for higher-rated or\ncomparable non-rated securities, and the market prices of such securities are subject to erratic and abrupt movements. The spread between bid and asked prices for such securities may be greater than normally expected. Such factors can adversely affect the prices at which these securities can be sold and may even make it difficult to sell such securities.\nInvestment in the securities of financially troubled issuers and operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk. These financial difficulties may never be overcome and may cause issuers to become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future opportunistically acquire the securities and obligations of distressed companies. These investments in distressed or bankrupt companies are subject to significant risks, including lack of income, extraordinary expenses, uncertainty with respect to satisfaction of debt, lower-than-expected investment values or income potentials and resale restrictions.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, the securities and other obligations of distressed or bankrupt companies. At times, distressed debt obligations may not produce income and may require us to bear certain extraordinary expenses (including legal, accounting, valuation and transaction expenses) in order to protect and recover our investment. Therefore, when we invest in distressed debt, our ability to achieve current income for our stockholders may be diminished, particularly where the portfolio company has negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\").\nWe also are subject to significant uncertainty as to when, in what manner and for what value the distressed debt we acquire will eventually be satisfied whether through a refinancing, restructuring, liquidation, an exchange offer or plan of reorganization involving the distressed debt securities or a payment of some amount in satisfaction of the obligation. In addition, even if an exchange offer is made or plan of reorganization is adopted with respect to distressed debt held by us, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by us in connection with such exchange offer or plan of reorganization will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated when the investment was made.\nMoreover, any securities received by us upon completion of an exchange offer or plan of reorganization may be restricted as to resale. As a result of our participation in negotiations with respect to any exchange offer or plan of reorganization with respect to an issuer of distressed debt, we may be restricted from disposing of such securities.\nOur portfolio securities typically do not have a readily available market price and, in such a case, we value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by our board of directors, which valuation is inherently subjective and may not reflect what we may actually realize from the sale of the investment.\nValuations of our portfolio, which will affect the amount of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee and our performance results, may involve uncertainties and judgmental determinations. As a BDC, we are required to account for our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Typically, there is not a public market for the securities of the privately held companies in which we invest. As a result, we value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Our board of directors has designated the Adviser as the valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. The fair value of such securities may change, potentially materially, between the date of the fair value determination and the release of the financial results for the corresponding period or the next date at which fair value is determined.\nThe process of valuing securities for which reliable market quotations are not available is based on inherent uncertainties, and the resulting values may differ from values that would have been determined had a ready market existed for such securities and may differ from the prices at which such securities may ultimately be sold. Further, third-party pricing information may at times not be available regarding certain of our securities, derivatives and other assets. Certain factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys earnings and its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to comparable publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. In addition, any investments that include OID or PIK interest may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require ongoing judgments about the collectability of their deferred payments and the value of their underlying collateral. Due to these uncertainties, fair value determinations may cause the Net Asset Value on a given date to materially understate or overstate the value that we ultimately realize upon the sale of one or more investments.\nA disruption in the secondary markets for our investments may limit the ability of our Adviser to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing our investments and calculating our Gross Asset Value and the Net Asset Value. In addition, material events occurring after the close of a principal market upon which a portion of our securities or other assets are traded may require the Adviser to make a determination of the effect of a material event on the value of the securities or other assets traded on the market for purposes of determining the fair value of our investments on a valuation date. If the valuation of our securities in accordance with Oaktrees valuation policy should prove to be incorrect, the fair value of our investments could be adversely affected. Absent bad faith or manifest error, valuation determinations in accordance with Oaktrees valuation policy will be conclusive and binding. Furthermore, these values are used to determine our Net Asset Value in connection with the shares of Common Stock. To the extent these investments are undervalued or overvalued, the Common Stock of existing stockholders or newly admitted stockholders could be adversely affected.\nWe may rely upon projections, forecasts or estimates developed by our Adviser and/or a portfolio company concerning a portfolio companys future performance and cash flow.\nWe may rely upon projections developed by Oaktree or a third party concerning an investments future performance and cash flow, including when deciding that the possibility of actual adversity in connection with an investment in a different part of the capital structure of the portfolio company is remote. Projections are inherently subject to uncertainty and factors beyond the control of Oaktree and the portfolio company. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. Different assumptions may produce different results. The inaccuracy of certain assumptions, the failure to satisfy certain financial requirements and the occurrence of other unforeseen events could impair the ability of a portfolio company to realize projected values and cash flow and could trigger the need for us to remain passive in the event of a restructuring. In addition, prospective investors should note that projected performance is not indicative of future results and there can be no assurance that the projected results or expected returns will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively implement our investment objective.\nIn addition, Oaktree may determine the suitability of investments based in part on the basis of financial projections for portfolio issuers. Events or conditions, including changes in general market conditions, which may not have been anticipated or which are otherwise not foreseeable, may occur and have a significant impact on the actual rate of return received with respect to our investments.\nOur portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry.\nExcept to the extent required as a BDC or RIC, the Adviser is not under any other obligation to diversify our investments, whether by reference to the amount invested or the industries or geographical areas in which portfolio companies operate. Oaktree may allocate capital among investments as it determines in its sole discretion, subject to the goal of maximizing our returns, and stockholders will have no assurances with respect to the diversification or geographic concentration of the investment program. This lack of diversification will expose us to losses disproportionate to market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse price movements in the particular investments, and our investment portfolio may be subject to more rapid changes in value than would be the case if we were required to maintain a wide diversification among companies, industries and types of securities. To the extent we hold investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class, industry or geographic region, we will be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment vehicle to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Unfavorable performance by any number of investments could substantially adversely affect the aggregate returns realized by stockholders. Approximately 19.69% of the Company's investments at fair value as of September 30, 2022 are concentrated in the Application Software industry.\nOur portfolio companies may be highly leveraged.\nOur investments may include companies whose capital structures have significant leverage. Such investments are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues and to increases in expenses and interest rates. The leveraged capital structure of such investments will increase the exposure of the portfolio companies to adverse economic factors, such as downturns in the economy or deterioration in the condition of the portfolio company or its industry. Additionally, the securities acquired by us may be the most junior in what will typically be a complex capital structure, and thus subject to the greatest risk of loss.\nFurthermore, we engage in certain investment activities that involve the use of leverage. The cumulative effect of our use of leverage in a market that moves adversely to our investments could result in a loss to us that would be greater than if leverage had not been used, including loss of the entire investment and also the possibility of loss exceeding the original amount of a particular investment. To the extent that we engage in any leveraging, it will be subject to the risks normally\nassociated with debt financing, including those relating to the ability to refinance and the insufficiency of cash flow to meet principal and interest payments, which could significantly reduce or even eliminate the value of our investment. Leveraging the capital structure will mean that third parties, such as banks, may be entitled to the cash flow generated by such investments prior to our receiving a return. Also, if an asset of us is mortgaged or otherwise used as collateral to secure repayment of indebtedness and such payments are not made, the asset could be foreclosed upon by the lender or otherwise transferred to the lender.\nThere are also financing costs associated with leverage, and such costs will be borne by us and therefore may adversely affect the rate of returns obtained by us. In addition, each leveraged investment will involve interest rate risk, including to the extent that financing charges for such leveraged investment are based on a predetermined interest rate. Our assets, including any investment made by us and any capital held by us, are available to satisfy all liabilities and our other obligations. If we default on secured indebtedness, the lender may foreclose and we could lose our entire investment in the collateral for such loan. If we become subject to a liability, parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to our assets generally and not be limited to any particular asset, such as the investment giving rise to the liability.\nInflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nCertain of our portfolio companies may be impacted by inflation. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs along to their customers, it could adversely affect their results and their ability to impacting their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans, particularly if interest rates rise in response to inflation. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations.\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our investments.\nWe may be called upon to provide follow-on funding for our investments or have the opportunity to increase our investment in such investments. There can be no assurance that we will wish to make follow-on investments or that we will have sufficient funds to do so. Any decision by us not to make follow-on investments or our inability to make them may have a substantial negative impact on an investment in need of such an investment or may diminish our ability to influence such investments future development. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will be able to predict accurately how much capital may need to be reserved by us for participation in follow-on investments. If more capital is reserved than is necessary, then we may receive a lower allocation of other investment opportunities. If less capital is reserved than is necessary, then we may not be able to fully protect or enhance our existing investment.\nBecause we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.\nWe generally do not make investments that result in control of, or significant influence over, a company. Although Oaktree monitors the performance of each investment and may make recommendations, we rely upon management to operate the portfolio companies on a day-to-day basis and equity sponsors who control the boards of directors of the portfolio companies to select qualified management for such companies. As a result, we may have a more limited ability to protect our investment in portfolio companies than if we held a controlling interest or position of significant influence. In addition, certain of our investments may be in businesses with limited operating histories.\nWhen we do have an ability to significantly influence a company or an investment, it will expose us to additional risks of liability and may subject us to indemnification obligations.\nIn certain circumstances, including if we invest in a different part of the capital structure as Other Oaktree Funds, our holdings may be aggregated with those of such Other Oaktree Funds, which collectively may be deemed to give these funds and accounts controlling interests in or the ability to significantly influence a portfolio company. The exercise of control of, or significant influence over, a portfolio company may impose additional risks of liability for environmental damage, product defects, failure to supervise management, violation of governmental regulations (including securities laws) or other types of liability in which the limited liability generally characteristic of business ownership may be ignored. In addition, a greater level of involvement by Oaktree in a portfolio company may subject us to a greater risk of litigation by third parties. The expense of defending against claims by third parties and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, absent certain conduct by Oaktree, be borne by us and would reduce our net assets. If these liabilities were to arise, we might suffer a\nsignificant loss. However, we may have a more limited ability to protect our investment in portfolio companies or issuers in which a controlling interest or position of significant influence has not been obtained. We will be required to indemnify Oaktree and others in connection with such litigation, as well as other matters arising as a result of our management, subject to certain conditions.\nWe invest in illiquid investments and may experience difficulty in selling those investments in a timely manner at the price that we believe the investments are worth.\nWe invest, and will continue to invest, in companies whose securities are illiquid, thinly traded for which no market exists or are restricted as to their transferability under applicable securities laws or documents governing our particular transactions. Some securities or instruments that were liquid at the time they were acquired may, for a variety of reasons which may not be in our control, later become illiquid. This factor may have the effect of limiting the availability of these securities or instruments for our purchase and may also limit our ability to sell such investments at their fair market value prior to our termination or in response to changes in the economy or the financial markets. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded our investments. Due to securities regulations governing certain publicly traded equity securities, our ability to sell securities could also be diminished with respect to equity holdings that represent a significant portion of the issuers securities (particularly if we have designated one or more directors of the issuer). Thus, there can be no assurance as to the timing and amount of our distributions, and any distribution that would require either an in-kind distribution or a forced sale of illiquid assets at a price deemed unattractive by the Adviser may occur after the expiration of the Investment Period. To the extent any of our investments cannot be sold prior to the end of the Investment Period, they may be distributed in kind to stockholders. The securities and instruments so distributed may not be readily marketable.\nWe may face risks in connection with frequent trading and high portfolio turnover.\nThe different strategies used by us may require frequent trading and a high portfolio turnover. The more frequently we trade, the higher the commission and transaction costs and certain other expenses involved in our operations. These costs will be borne by us regardless of the profitability of our investment and trading activities. In addition, a high portfolio turnover may increase the recognition of short-term, rather than long-term, capital gains.\nDebt instruments and loans acquired by us may become non-performing following their acquisition.\nDebt instruments and loans acquired by us may become non-performing following their acquisition for a wide variety of reasons. Such non-performing instruments or loans may require a substantial amount of workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial reduction in the interest rate and a substantial write-down of principal. It is possible that we may find it necessary or desirable to foreclose on collateral securing one or more real loans purchased by us. The foreclosure process varies jurisdiction by jurisdiction and can be lengthy and expensive. Borrowers often resist foreclosure actions, which often prolongs and complicates an already difficult and time-consuming process. In some states or other jurisdictions, foreclosure actions can take up to several years or more to conclude. During the foreclosure proceedings, a borrower may have the ability to file for bankruptcy, potentially staying the foreclosure action and further delaying the foreclosure process. Foreclosure litigation tends to create a negative public image of the collateral property and may result in disrupting ongoing leasing and management of the property.\nThere may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims.\nIn recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively termed lender liability). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors. We may be subject to potential allegations of lender liability. In addition, courts have in some cases applied the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim of a lending institution against a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when the lending institution is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct. Such claims may be brought even if we acquired the loan on a secondary basis.\nIf we make unsecured debt investments, we may lack adequate protection in the event our portfolio companies become distressed or insolvent and will likely experience a lower recovery than more senior debtholders in the event such portfolio companies default on their indebtedness.\nIn the event of a default by a borrower, we might not receive payments to which we are entitled and thereby could experience a decline in the value of our investments in the borrower. If we invest in debt that is not secured by collateral, in the event of such default, we will have only an unsecured claim against the borrower. In the case of second lien loans that are secured by collateral, while Oaktree generally expects the value of the collateral to be greater than the value of such secured second lien loans, the value of the collateral may actually be equal to or less than the value of such second lien loans or may decline below the outstanding amount of such second lien loans subsequent to our investment. Our ability to have access to the collateral may be limited by bankruptcy and other insolvency laws. Under certain circumstances, the collateral may be released with the consent of the lenders or pursuant to the terms of the underlying loan agreement with the borrower. There is no assurance that the liquidation of the collateral securing a loan would occur in a timely fashion or would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled interest or principal, or that the collateral could be readily liquidated. As a result, we might not receive full payment on a secured loan investment to which we are entitled and thereby may experience a decline in the value of, or a loss on, the investment.\nIf we acquire the securities and obligations of distressed or bankrupt companies, such investments may be subject to significant risks, including lack of income, extraordinary expenses, uncertainty with respect to satisfaction of debt, lower-than-expected investment values or income potentials and resale restrictions.\nWe may acquire the securities and other obligations of distressed or bankrupt companies. At times, distressed debt obligations may not produce income and may require us to bear certain extraordinary expenses (including legal, accounting, valuation and transaction expenses) in order to protect and recover our investment. Therefore, to the extent we invest in distressed debt, our ability to achieve current income for our stockholders may be diminished, particularly where the portfolio company has negative EBITDA.\nWe also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the distressed debt we invest in will eventually be satisfied whether through a liquidation, an exchange offer or plan of reorganization involving the distressed debt securities or a payment of some amount in satisfaction of the obligation. In addition, even if an exchange offer is made or plan of reorganization is adopted with respect to distressed debt held by us, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by us in connection with such exchange offer or plan of reorganization will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated when the investment was made.\nMoreover, any securities received by us upon completion of an exchange offer or plan of reorganization may be restricted as to resale. As a result of our participation in negotiations with respect to any exchange offer or plan of reorganization with respect to an issuer of distressed debt, we may be restricted from disposing of such securities.\nLeveraged companies may enter into bankruptcy proceedings at higher rates than companies that are not leveraged and we may invest in debt securities of these companies.\nLeveraged companies, such as those in which we invest or plan to invest, may be more prone to bankruptcy or similar financial distress. As a result, we may need to modify the payment terms of our investments, including changes in PIK interest provisions and/or cash interest rates. The performances of such companies have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions, which may result in our receipt of a reduced level of interest income from such portfolio companies and/or losses or charge offs related to such investments, and, in turn, may adversely affect distributable income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur success may depend, in part, on the ability of the Adviser to effectuate loan modifications or restructure and improve the operations of portfolio companies. The activity of identifying and implementing any such restructuring programs and operating improvements entails a high degree of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will be able to successfully identify and implement such restructuring programs and improvements.\nA portfolio companys failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio companys ability to meet its obligations under the securities that we will hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, we may write down the value of a\nportfolio company investment upon the worsening of the financial condition of the portfolio company or in anticipation of a default, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with foreign investments.\nCertain non-U.S. investments involve risks and special considerations not typically associated with U.S. investments. Such risks include (a) the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets or confiscatory taxation, (b) social, economic and political uncertainty, including crime, corruption, war, terrorism and revolution, (c) dependence on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade, (d) differences between U.S. and non-U.S. markets, including price fluctuations, market volatility, less liquidity and smaller capitalization of securities markets, (e) currency exchange rate fluctuations, (f) rates of inflation, (g) controls on, and changes in controls on, foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital and on our ability to exchange local currencies for U.S. dollars, (h) governmental involvement in and control over the economies, (i) governmental decisions to discontinue support of economic reform programs generally and impose centrally planned economies, (j) differences in auditing and financial reporting standards that may result in the unavailability of material information about issuers, (k) less extensive regulation and less government supervision of the securities markets, exchanges, brokers and issuers, (l) longer settlement periods for securities transactions, (m) less developed bankruptcy laws and corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties and the protection of investors, (n) less reliable judicial systems to enforce contracts and applicable law, (o) certain considerations regarding the maintenance of our portfolio securities and cash with non-U.S. sub-custodians and securities depositories, (p) the possible imposition of non-U.S. taxes on income and gains recognized with respect to such non-U.S. investments, (q) restrictions and prohibitions on ownership of property by non-U.S. entities and changes in laws relating thereto and (r) additional transactional costs and administrative burdens as a result of local legal requirements. We may be adversely affected by the foregoing events, or by future adverse developments in global or regional economic conditions or in the financial or credit markets.\nIn addition, foreign investment in the securities of issuers in certain nations is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions or controls may at times limit or preclude non-U.S. investment in issuers in such nations and increase our costs and expenses. Certain countries may restrict investment opportunities in issuers or industries deemed important to national interests. Some countries require governmental approval for the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by non-U.S. investors. In addition, if there is a deterioration in a countrys balance of payments or for other reasons, a country may impose temporary restrictions on, or altogether change its restrictions on, non-U.S. capital remittances abroad. In response to sovereign debt or currency crises, for example, certain governments have enacted legislation that imposes restrictions on the inflow and outflow of foreign currency into and from such country. These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to source investments or repatriate investment proceeds. Repatriation of capital was particularly a problem during the sovereign debt and currency crises of the 1990s and continues to be a problem today in certain countries. Even where capital controls do not prohibit remittances abroad, the repatriation of proceeds from investment dispositions may require the procurement of a substantial number of regulatory consents, certificates and approvals, including licenses for us and clearance certificates from tax or monetary authorities. Obtaining such approvals or licenses may be difficult, expensive and time consuming and may depend on political or other factors outside our control. Finally, repatriation of income from and investments in entities that are organized or domiciled in non-U.S. countries may be affected adversely by local withholding and other non-U.S. tax requirements. The foregoing requirements and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to source investments or repatriate investment proceeds, and there can be no assurance that we will be permitted to repatriate capital or profits, if any, from the non U.S. jurisdictions in which we invest.\nOur obligations in connection with investments in bank loans and participations are subject to unique risks.\nOur investment program may include investments in significant amounts of bank loans and participations, as well as other direct lending transactions. These obligations are subject to unique risks, including (a) the possible invalidation of an investment transaction as a fraudulent conveyance under relevant creditors rights laws, (b) so-called lender-liability claims by the issuer of the obligations, (c) environmental liabilities that may arise with respect to collateral securing the obligations and (d) limitations on our ability to enforce directly our rights with respect to participations. In addition, bank loans may not be deemed to be securities for purposes of the federal securities laws and therefore may not have the protections afforded by the federal securities laws, including anti-fraud protections. In analyzing each bank loan or participation, we compare the relative significance of the risks against the expected benefits of the investment. Successful claims by third parties arising from these and other risks, absent certain conduct by the Adviser, its affiliates and certain other individuals, will be borne by us. In addition, the settlement process for the purchase of bank loans can take significantly longer than the timeframes established by the Loan Syndications & Trading Association and comparable non-U.S. bodies. The longer a trade is outstanding between the counterparties, the greater the risk of additional operational and settlement issues and the potential for our counterparty to fail to perform.\nIf we purchase a participation, we will not have established any direct contractual relationship with the borrower. We will be required to rely on the lender or the participant that sold the participation, not only for the enforcement of our rights against the borrower, but also for the receipt and processing of payments due to us under the participation. We will thus be subject to the credit risk of both the borrower and the selling lender or participant. Because it may be necessary to assert through the selling lender or participant such rights as may exist against the borrower, in the event the borrower fails to pay principal and interest when due, such assertion of rights against the borrower may be subject to delays, expenses and risks that are greater than those that would be involved if we could enforce our rights against the borrower directly.\nWe will face risks in effective operating improvements.\nIn some cases, the success of our investment strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to restructure and effect improvements in the operations of a portfolio company. The activity of identifying and implementing restructuring programs and operating improvements at portfolio companies entails a high degree of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and implement such restructuring programs and improvements.\nOur portfolio companies may incur debt or issue equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.\nOur portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payments of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.\nWe may be exposed to higher risks with respect to our investments that include OID or PIK interest.\nOur investments include OID and contractual PIK interest, which typically represents contractual interest added to a loan balance and due at the end of such loans term. To the extent OID or PIK interest constitute a portion of our income, we are exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash, including the following:\nOID and PIK instruments may have higher yields, which reflect the payment deferral and credit risk associated with these instruments\u037e\nOID and PIK accruals may create uncertainty about the source of our distributions to stockholders\u037e\nOID and PIK instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of the collateral\u037e and\nOID and PIK instruments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon loans.\nWe may invest in derivatives, which involve numerous risks.\nWhile not anticipated to be a meaningful aspect of our investment strategy, we have and may in the future enter into certain foreign exchange and possibly certain other types of OTC derivative instruments from time to time. While Oaktree expects us to enter into OTC contracts on a bilateral basis with banks or other dealers, we may enter into certain derivatives that are traded on swap execution facilities (SEFs), security-based swap execution facilities or other similar multi-lateral trading platforms. Certain of such derivatives may be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs).\nInvesting in derivative instruments, particularly OTC derivatives, presents various risks, including market, counterparty, operational and liquidity risks. The prices of derivative instruments, including swaps, forwards and options may be highly volatile and such instruments may subject us to significant loses. The value of derivatives also depends upon the price of the underlying security or other asset or index. Typically, investing in a derivative instrument requires the deposit or payment of an initial amount much smaller than the notional or nominal exposure amount from such derivative instrument. Therefore, if the\nrelevant cash market moves against us, we will suffer a larger loss than we would have by directly investing in the underlying security or other asset or index. OTC derivatives are also subject to the default and credit risk of the counterparty if they are not cleared through CCPs, while centrally cleared derivatives are subject to the credit risk of the CCP and the relevant futures commission merchant (FCM) or other clearing broker. In addition, significant disparities may exist between bid and ask prices for derivative instruments that are traded over-the-counter and not on an exchange. While such OTC derivatives are subject to increased regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act, the investor protections and other regulations applicable to such OTC derivatives differ from those applicable to futures and other exchange-traded instruments. In addition, compared with such exchange-traded instruments, the market for OTC derivatives is less liquid.\nWe may have foreign currency risks related to our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.\nA portion of our investments are, and may continue to be, located in jurisdictions other than the United States and, consequently, we are expected to make certain investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the rates of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies will have an effect, which could be adverse, on our performance, amounts available for withdrawal and the value of securities distributed by us. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. Additionally, a particular foreign country may impose exchange controls, devalue its currency or take other measures relating to its currency which could adversely affect us. Finally, we could incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies.\nWe are not obligated to hedge currency risks. Even if Oaktree does so, Oaktree may not be able to put a hedge in place on commercially reasonable terms given the credit terms offered by our counterparties or the volatility of the currency. There can be no guarantee that instruments suitable for hedging market shifts will be available at the time when we wish to use them or that any hedge would reduce applicable risks. More specifically, if we hedge currency risk, we do not expect that the full risk of currency fluctuations can be eliminated due to the complexity of the investment characteristics of the portfolio and limitations in the foreign currency market. We will conduct our foreign currency exchange transactions in anticipation of funding investment commitments or receiving proceeds upon dispositions.\nWe may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.\nIn addition to currency hedging, the Adviser may also use other financial instruments for hedging and risk management purposes, including short sales, in order to (a) protect against possible changes in the market value of our investment portfolio resulting from fluctuations in the securities markets and changes in interest rates, (b) protect our unrealized gains in the value of our investment portfolio, (c) facilitate the sale of any such investments, (d) preserve returns, spreads or gains on any investment, (e) hedge the interest rate on any liabilities or assets, (f) protect against any increase in the price of any investments we anticipate purchasing at a later date or (g) for any other similar reason that the Adviser deems appropriate. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions and amounts due under our credit facilities or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase.\nThe success of our hedging strategy will be subject to the Advisers ability to correctly assess the degree of correlation between the performance of the instruments used in the hedging strategy and the performance of the investments in the portfolio being hedged along with the Advisers ability to continually recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient and timely manner. Therefore, though we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce risks, unanticipated changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings or credit facilities being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the effect of the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. The successful utilization of hedging and risk management transactions requires skills complementary to those needed in the selection of portfolio holdings. It may not be possible to hedge at an acceptable price that is generally anticipated. In addition, we may determine not to hedge against particular risks, including if we determine that available hedging transactions are not available at an acceptable price.\nWe may be exposed to credit risk on parties with whom we trade and will also bear the risk of settlement default.\nFrom time to time, certain securities markets have experienced operational clearance and settlement problems that have resulted in failed trades. These problems could cause us to miss attractive investment opportunities or result in our liability to\nthird parties by virtue of an inability to perform our contractual obligation to deliver securities, or we could be unable to achieve the market position selected by Oaktree or might incur a loss in liquidating our positions. In addition, delays and inefficiencies of the local postal, transport and banking systems could result in the loss of investment opportunities, the loss of funds (including dividends) and exposure to currency fluctuations.\nBecause certain purchases, sales, securities lending, derivatives and other transactions in which we engage involve instruments that are not traded on an exchange, but are instead traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, we are subject to the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under the related contracts, as well as risks of transfer, clearance or settlement default. Such risks may be exacerbated with respect to non-U.S. securities or transactions with non-U.S. counterparties. There can be no assurance that a counterparty will not default and that we will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result. Such risks may differ materially from those entailed in exchange-traded transactions that generally are backed by clearing organization guarantees, daily marking-to-market and settlement of positions and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries. There can be no assurance that Oaktrees monitoring activities will be sufficient to adequately control counterparty risk.\nIn situations where we are required to post margin or other collateral with a counterparty, the counterparty may fail to segregate such assets or collateral, as applicable, or may commingle the assets or collateral with the relevant counterpartys own assets or collateral, as applicable. As a result, in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of any counterparty, our excess assets and collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the creditors of the relevant counterparty, and we may be exposed to the risk of a court treating us as a general unsecured creditor of such counterparty, rather than as the owner of such assets or collateral, as the case may be.\nTransactions entered into by us may be executed on various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges, and may be cleared and settled through various clearing houses, custodians, depositories and prime brokers throughout the world. Although we will attempt to execute, clear and settle the transactions through entities Oaktree believes to be sound, there can be no assurance that a failure by any such entity will not lead to a loss to us.\nCertain of our transactions may be undertaken through local brokers, banks or other organizations in the countries in which we make investments, and we will be subject to the risk of default, insolvency or fraud of such organizations. The collection, transfer and deposit of bearer securities and cash expose us to a variety of risks, including theft, loss and destruction. Finally, we will be dependent upon the general soundness of the banking systems of countries in which investments will be made.\nWe may enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which are another form of leverage.\nWe may enter into reverse repurchase agreements as part of our management of our temporary investment portfolio. Under a reverse repurchase agreement, we will effectively pledge our assets as collateral to secure a short-term loan. Generally, the other party to the agreement makes the loan in an amount equal to a percentage of the fair value of the pledged collateral. At the maturity of the reverse repurchase agreement, we will be required to repay the loan and correspondingly receive back our collateral. While used as collateral, the assets continue to pay principal and interest which are for our benefit.\nOur use of reverse repurchase agreements, if any, involves many of the same risks involved in our use of leverage, as the proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements generally will be invested in additional securities. There is a risk that the market value of the securities acquired in the reverse repurchase agreement may decline below the price of the securities that we have sold but remain obligated to purchase. In addition, there is a risk that the market value of the securities retained by us may decline. If a buyer of securities under a reverse repurchase agreement were to file for bankruptcy or experience insolvency, we may be adversely affected. Also, in entering into reverse repurchase agreements, we would bear the risk of loss to the extent that the proceeds of such agreements at settlement are less than the fair value of the underlying securities being pledged. In addition, due to the interest costs associated with reverse repurchase agreements, our Net Asset Value would decline, and, in some cases, we may be worse off than if we had not used such agreements.\nThe disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities.\nIn connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, we may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such company typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business. We also may be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment with respect to certain matters, including the accuracy of such representations. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities for which the Adviser may establish reserves or escrows.\nWe invest directly in senior secured loans, including at initial issuance, which would typically have limited mandatory amortization and interim repayment requirements.\nWe invest directly in senior secured loans, including at initial issuance, which would typically have limited mandatory amortization and interim repayment requirements. A low level of amortization of any directly originated senior secured loans over the life of such senior secured loans may increase the risk that an issuer will not be able to repay or refinance the senior secured loans held by us when it comes due at its final stated maturity.\nOur investments include covenant-lite loans, which may give us fewer rights and subject us to greater risk of loss than loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nAlthough the loans in which we expect to invest will generally have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio companys financial performance, we do invest to a lesser extent in covenant-lite loans. We use the term covenant-lite to refer generally to loans that do not have financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrowers financial condition or operating results. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.\nOur investment activities subject us to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties.\nOur investment activities subject us to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk is somewhat greater where we exercise control or significant influence over a companys direction. In addition, in the course of providing managerial assistance to certain portfolio companies, certain of our or the Advisers officers and directors may serve as directors on the boards of such companies. In connection therewith, we will be required to indemnify the Adviser and its affiliates, and each of their respective members, officers, directors, employees, shareholders, partners, and certain other persons who serve at the request of the Adviser or its affiliates on our behalf for liabilities incurred in connection with our affairs. Such liabilities may be material and have an adverse effect on the returns to the stockholders. The expense of defending against claims by third parties and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, absent certain conduct by the Adviser, be payable from our assets. It should also be noted that the Adviser may, but shall not be required to, purchase insurance for us, the Adviser and our affiliates, employees, agents and representatives. Additionally, the Governing Documents, to the extent permitted by law, will limit the circumstances under which the Adviser can be held liable to us and the stockholders. As a result, the stockholders may have a more limited right of action in certain cases than they would in the absence of this provision.\nWe may invest through joint ventures, partnerships or other special purpose vehicles and investments through these vehicles may entail greater risks, or risks that we otherwise would not incur, if we otherwise made such investments directly.\nWe may co-invest with third parties through funds, joint ventures or other entities. Such investments may involve risks not present in investments where a third party is not involved, including the possibility that our co-venturer or partner may at any time have other business interests and investments other than the joint venture with us, or may have different economic or business goals. In addition, we may be liable for actions of our co-venturers or partners. Our ability to exercise control or significant influence over management in these cooperative efforts will depend upon the nature of the joint venture arrangement. In addition, such arrangements are likely to involve restrictions on the resale of our interest in the company.\nOur Adviser has broad discretion in selecting our investments and investment techniques.\nWe may employ investment techniques and invest in other instruments that the Adviser believes will help achieve our investment objective, whether or not such investment techniques or instruments are specifically described herein. Consistent with our investment objective, we may invest in financial instruments of any and all types, which exist now or are hereafter created. Such investments may entail risks not described herein.\nOur portfolio companies may prepay loans, which may have the effect of reducing our investment income if the returned capital cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields.\nThe loans in our investment portfolio may be prepaid at any time, generally with little advance notice. Whether a loan is prepaid will depend both on the continued positive performance of the portfolio company and the existence of favorable\nfinancing market conditions that allow such portfolio company the ability to replace existing financing with less expensive capital. In periods of rising interest rates, the risk of prepayment of floating rate loans may increase if other financing sources are available. As market conditions change frequently, we will often be unable to predict when, and if, prepayment may be possible for each portfolio company. In some cases, the prepayment of a loan may have the effect of reducing our actual investment income below our expected investment income if the capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\nWe invest, and will continue to invest, in companies whose securities are not publicly traded, and whose securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. In fact, all of our assets may be invested in illiquid securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments and suffer losses. Our investments may be subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments. In addition, we may also face restrictions on our ability to liquidate our investments if our Adviser or any of its affiliates have material nonpublic information regarding the portfolio company.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with our origination activities.\nThe market for originating debt and equity financing is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively with other market participants for origination opportunities. We may compete for opportunities with public and private investment funds, commercial and investment banks and commercial finance companies. In general, the corporate, non-mortgage debt and equity origination markets present relatively low barriers to entry, and significant competition is likely.\nMany current and potential competitors in the debt and equity origination business are much larger than we are and, accordingly, have far greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. We are subject to various elements of competition, including interest rates and financing costs; origination standards; convenience; customer service; the size, term and seniority of financing arrangements; and marketing and distribution channels. Price pressure from competitors (including market participants that are not directly originating loans) may cause us to lower the interest rates that we charge borrowers, which consequently may lower the value of our loans. Further, if competitors adopt less stringent loan origination standards in order to maintain their loan origination volume, we may elect to do so as well. If we adopt less stringent loan origination standards, we will bear increased risk for each loan originated under such less stringent standards, which may not be compensated by an increase in price. Alternatively, we may determine not to adopt less stringent origination standards in this competitive environment, which decision may result in a loss of market share. Increased pressure on pricing and origination opportunities likely would reduce the volume and quality of our origination activity and materially adversely affect us. In particular, from time to time there may be influxes of capital directed at lending to smaller borrowers, which may result in a tendency by the highest quality borrowers to borrow from sources other than us such that our origination opportunities and our eventual portfolio include a disproportionate number of lower quality borrowers or issuers, exacerbating some of the risks outlined here.\nSome competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, thereby allowing such competitors to achieve a broad diversification of investments and to establish more relationships than we are able to establish. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to more stable funding sources that are not available to us. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWhen we originate a loan, we expect to rely significantly upon representations made by the borrower. There can be no assurance that such representations are accurate or complete, or that any due diligence by the Investment Professionals would identify any misrepresentation or omission. Any misrepresentation or omission by a borrower to which we originate a loan may adversely affect the valuation of the collateral underlying the loan, or may adversely affect our ability to perfect or foreclose on a lien on the collateral securing the loan, or may result in our liability to a subsequent purchaser of the loan.\nFinally, under certain circumstances, payments to us may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance or a preferential payment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Structure\nWe face risks associated with the deployment of our capital.\nIn light of our need to be able to deploy capital quickly to capitalize on potential investment opportunities or to establish reserves for anticipated debts, liabilities or obligations, including liquidity needs, we may hold cash in money market investments pending deployment into other investments, the amount of which may at times be significant. While the duration of any such holding period is expected to be relatively short, in the event we are unable to find suitable investments, such money market investments may be held for longer periods, which would be dilutive to overall investment returns. It is not anticipated that the temporary investment of such cash into money market investments will generate significant interest, and stockholders should understand that such low interest payments on the temporarily invested cash may adversely affect our overall returns.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including the current rising interest rate environment.\nDebt investments that we make may be based on floating rates, such as SOFR (as defined below), SONIA (as defined below) LIBOR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or alternate base rates such as the prime rate. General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our securities and our rate of return on invested capital. It is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and the future of LIBOR may affect market liquidity and the value of the financial obligations to be held by or issued to us that are linked to LIBOR, or how such changes could affect our investments and transactions and financial condition or results of operations. Central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for interbank offered rates. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Authority announced that the publication of all EUR and CHF LIBOR settings, the Spot Next/Overnight, 1 week, 2 month and 12 month JPY and GBP LIBOR settings, and the 1 week and 2 months US dollar LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021, while the publication of the overnight, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 months U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings will cease after June 30, 2023. To identify a successor rate for USD LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a U.S.-based group convened by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was formed. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by the U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. On December 6, 2021, the ARRC released a statement selecting and recommending forms of SOFR, along with associated spread adjustments and conforming changes, to replace references to 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR. We expect that a substantial portion of our future floating rate investments will be linked to SOFR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of the transition to SOFR.\nBecause we have borrowed money, our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay distributions on preferred stock and the rate that our investments yield. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nA reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could also have an adverse impact on our net interest income. However, an increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates, including subordinated loans, senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans and high yield bonds, and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield.\nIn 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised short term interest rates and has suggested additional interest rate increases may come. Changing interest rates may have unpredictable effects on markets, may result in heightened market volatility and may detract from our performance to the extent we are exposed to such interest rates and/or volatility. In periods of rising interest rates, such as the current interest rate environment, to the extent we borrow money subject to a floating interest rate, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with floating interest rates, subject to specified minimum interest rates (such as a LIBOR or SOFR floor, as applicable), while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to floating interest rates not subject to such minimums. In such a scenario, rising interest rates may increase our interest expense, even though our interest income from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner as a result of such minimum interest rates.\nIf general interest rates rise, there is a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. In addition, rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide fixed rate loans to our portfolio companies, which could adversely affect our net investment income, as increases in our cost of borrowed funds would not be accompanied by increased interest income from such fixed-rate investments.\nA change in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to a change in the interest rates we receive on many of our debt investments. Accordingly, a change in the interest rate could make it easier for us to meet or exceed the performance threshold in the Investment Advisory Agreement and may result in a substantial increase in the amount of incentive fees payable to our Adviser with respect to the portion of the incentive fee based on income.\nThe general increase in interest rates has had the effect of increasing our net investment income, which makes it easier for our Adviser to receive incentive fees.\nThe general increase in interest rates has had the effect of increasing the interest rate that we receive on many of our debt investments. Accordingly, it has become easier for our Adviser to meet the quarterly hurdle rate for payment of income incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement and has resulted in an increase in the amount of the income-based incentive fee payable to our Adviser.\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation at the local, state and federal level. New legislation may be enacted or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, including those governing the types of investments we are permitted to make or that impose limits on our ability to pledge a significant amount of our assets to secure loans or that restrict the operations of a portfolio company, any of which could harm us and our stockholders and the value of our investments, potentially with retroactive effect. For example, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which influences many aspects of the financial services industry, have been amended or repealed and the Code has been substantially amended and reformed. Any amendment or repeal of legislation, or changes in regulations or regulatory interpretations thereof, could create uncertainty in the near term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any changes to the laws and regulations governing our operations relating to permitted investments may cause us to alter our investment strategy in order to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities. Such changes could result in material differences to the strategies and plans set forth herein and may result in our investment focus shifting from the areas of expertise of our Adviser to other types of investments in which our Adviser may have less expertise or little or no experience. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. We compete for investments with various other investors, such as other public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds, some of which may be our affiliates. Other Oaktree funds have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create competition for investment opportunities. Many competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, and may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships. Furthermore, many competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. The competitive pressures could impair our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities.\nRegulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.\nIn order to qualify for the tax benefits available to RICs and to minimize corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes, we intend to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income each tax year, except that we may retain certain net\ncapital gains for investment, and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we elect to treat any amounts as deemed distributions, we would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate rate on such deemed distributions on behalf of our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we have issued and may continue to issue senior securities, including borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 150% after such incurrence or issuance. These requirements limit the amount that we may borrow, may unfavorably limit our investment opportunities and may reduce our ability in comparison to other companies to profit from favorable spreads between the rates at which we can borrow and the rates at which we can lend. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test, which could prohibit us from paying distributions and could prevent us from being subject to tax as a RIC. If we cannot satisfy the asset coverage test, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our debt financing, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Accordingly, any failure to satisfy this test could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause we will continue to need capital to grow our investment portfolio, these limitations may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. We generally are not able to issue or sell Common Stock at a price below the then-current Net Asset Value per share of Common Stock, which may be a disadvantage as compared with other public companies or private investment funds. We may, however, sell Common Stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire Common Stock, at a price below the then-current Net Asset Value per share of Common Stock if the following conditions, among others, are satisfied: (i) a majority of our stockholders and a majority of our stockholders that are not our affiliates approve such sales within one year immediately prior to such sales and (ii) a majority of our independent directors and a majority of our directors who have no financial interest in the transaction determine that such sales are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nAlso, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness or senior securities would not be available for distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of issuing indebtedness or senior securities, stockholders would also be exposed to typical risks associated with increased leverage, including an increased risk of loss resulting from increased indebtedness.\nIf we issue preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank senior to the Common Stock, preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and might have other rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of stockholders, and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for stockholders or otherwise be in their best interest.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing more Common Stock or issuing senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, Common Stock, the percentage ownership of then-existing stockholders may decline at that time and such stockholders may experience dilution. Moreover, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue and sell additional equity securities in the future, on terms favorable to us or at all.\nIn addition, we securitize and may in the future seek to securitize our portfolio securities to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we typically create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We then typically sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. An inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business or fully execute our business strategy and may decrease our earnings, if any. The securitization market is subject to changing market conditions and we may not be able to access this market when we would otherwise deem appropriate. Moreover, the successful securitization of our portfolio might subject us to losses as the residual investments in which we do not sell interests will tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses. The Investment Company Act also may impose restrictions on the structure of any securitization.\nOur board of directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval.\nOur board of directors has the authority to modify or waive our current investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current investment objective, operating policies and strategies would have on our business, Net Asset Value and operating results. However, the effects might be adverse, which could negatively impact our ability to pay distributions and cause stockholders to lose part or all of their investment.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we do not know if such status will make our shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, which means that we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and disclosure requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, we have taken advantage of the exemption for emerging growth companies allowing us to temporarily forgo the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot predict if investors will find the Common Stock less attractive because we rely on this exemption. If some investors find the Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be less of an interest in investing. We did not take advantage of other disclosure or reporting exemptions for emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of an initial public offering, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nFuture control deficiencies could prevent us from accurately and timely reporting our financial results.\nWe may identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, including significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a companys financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.\nFailure to identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or remediate any deficiencies, or the identification of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future could prevent us from accurately and timely reporting our financial results.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\") and our amended and restated bylaws (the \"Bylaws\", and together with the Certificate of Incorporation, the \"Governing Documents\") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), as well as other aspects of our structure, could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of the Common Stock following a Qualified Listing, if any.\nOur Governing Documents, as well as the DGCL, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. Among other things, the Governing Documents:\nprovide that our board of directors is classified, which may delay the ability of holders of Common Stock to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\ndo not provide for cumulative voting;\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of remaining directors then in office (even if they constitute less than a quorum), or by a sole remaining director, subject to any applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act and the rights of any holders of preferred stock;\nprovide that our board of directors may be removed only for cause, and only by a supermajority vote of the stockholders entitled to elect such directors;\nprovide that, following a Qualified Listing, stockholders may only take action at an annual or special meeting, and may not act by written consent;\nrestrict stockholders ability to call special meetings; and\nrequire a vote of 75% of stockholders to effect certain amendments to our Governing Documents.\nWe have provisions comparable to those of Section 203 of the DGCL. These provisions generally prohibit us from engaging in mergers, business combinations and certain other types of transactions with interested stockholders (generally defined as persons or entities that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock), other than certain exempt parties, for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless, (a) prior to such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, our board of directors has approved the business combination that would otherwise be restricted or the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, (b) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting securities outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting securities outstanding (but not the outstanding voting securities owned by the interested stockholder) those shares owned by persons who are our directors and also officers or (c) the business combination has been approved by our board of directors and 66 2/3% of its outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Common Stock owned by the interested stockholder). Such provisions may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.\nThese anti-takeover provisions may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could give the holders of Common Stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for the Common Stock following an initial public offering of the Common Stock, if any. In addition, certain aspects of our structure may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to the Advisers or our operations, a compromise or corruption of the Advisers or our confidential information or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCybersecurity incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level and are expected to continue to increase in frequency and severity in the future. The information and technology systems of Oaktree, its affiliates, portfolio companies, issuers and service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or other malicious code, network failures, computer and telecommunication failures, infiltration by unauthorized persons and other security breaches, usage errors or malfeasance by their respective professionals or service providers, power, communications or other service outages, and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or terrorist incidents. If unauthorized parties gain access to such information and technology systems, or if personnel abuse or misuse their access privileges, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify private and sensitive information, including non-public personal information related to stockholders (and their beneficial owners) and material non-public information. Although Oaktree has implemented, and portfolio companies, issuers and service providers may implement, various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, such systems could prove to be inadequate and, if compromised, could become inoperable for extended periods of time, cease to function properly or fail to adequately secure private information. Oaktree does not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third party service providers, and such third party service providers may have limited indemnification obligations to Oaktree, its affiliates, us, the stockholders and/or a portfolio company, each of whom could be negatively impacted as a result. Breaches such as those involving covertly introduced malware, impersonation of authorized users and industrial or other espionage may not be identified in a timely manner or at all, even with sophisticated prevention and detection systems. This could potentially result in further harm and prevent such breaches from being addressed appropriately. The failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in Oaktrees, its affiliates, our and/or a portfolio companys operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to stockholders (and their beneficial owners), material non-public information and the intellectual property and trade secrets and other sensitive information of Oaktree and/or portfolio companies or issuers. Oaktree, we and/or a portfolio company could be required to make a significant investment to remedy the effects of any such failures, harm to their reputations, legal claims that they and their respective affiliates may be subjected to, regulatory action or enforcement arising out of applicable privacy and other laws, adverse publicity, and other events that may affect their business and financial performance.\nCertain investors are limited in their ability to make significant investments in us.\nAs long as the Common Stock is not treated as a publicly-offered security for purposes of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), our Adviser intends that our assets should not be deemed to constitute plan assets subject to ERISA or Section 1975 of the Code by limiting investments in us by benefit plan investors (as defined in section 3(42) of ERISA and the regulations that may be promulgated thereunder) to less than 25% of the total value of any outstanding class of our capital stock. Were our assets to be treated as plan assets, we could, among other things, be subject to certain restrictions on our ability to carry out our activities as described herein.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain various required licenses in U.S. states or in any other jurisdiction where it may be required in the future.\nCertain federal and local banking and other regulatory bodies or agencies inside or outside the United States may require us and/or our Adviser to obtain licenses or similar authorizations to engage in various types of lending activities, including investment in senior loans. Such licenses or authorizations may take a significant amount of time to obtain, and may require the disclosure of confidential information regarding us, a stockholder in us or our respective affiliates, including financial information and/or information regarding officers and directors of such investor, and we may or may not be willing or able to comply with these requirements. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such licenses or authorizations would be granted or, if so, would not impose restrictions on us. Alternatively, the Adviser may be able to structure our potential investments in a manner which would not require such licenses and authorizations, but which would be inefficient or otherwise disadvantageous for us and/or the borrower. The inability of us or the Adviser to obtain such licenses or authorizations, or the structuring of an investment in an inefficient or otherwise disadvantageous manner, could adversely affect the Advisers ability to implement the strategy for us and our results.\nWe may not replicate the historical success of Oaktree.\nThe past performance of other funds, accounts or investment vehicles managed by our Adviser or its affiliates is not necessarily indicative of our future performance and provides no assurance of future results. As a BDC, we are subject to certain investment limitations that do not apply to other funds, accounts or investment vehicles managed by Oaktree and its affiliates and, accordingly, we may have a materially different portfolio than does such other funds, accounts or investment vehicles. In addition, the fees and expenses we will pay may be different from, and may be higher than, those applicable to such other funds, accounts or investment vehicles. Furthermore, our Adviser does not have significant experience operating under the constraints imposed on us as a BDC, which may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (a) successfully identify, make and realize upon any particular investment or (b) achieve desired spreads and yields to maturity (or that such performance will be commensurate with the risks associated with an investment in us). Actual realized returns will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, pace of deployment, refinancings, whether such interests are held to maturity, value of the underlying assets, foreclosures, market conditions, legal and contractual restrictions, any related transaction costs, and the timing and manner of sale. Therefore, the actual realized returns may differ materially from those obtained by other funds, accounts or investment vehicles managed by Oaktree and its affiliates and there can be no assurance that any such performance will be achieved or that losses will be avoided.\nChanges in tax laws or tax treaties could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe jurisdictions in which we may invest impose taxes on the types of income such as dividends, interest and in some instances, capital gains. In addition, changes in the tax laws or tax treaties (or their interpretation) of the countries in which we invest may severely and adversely affect our ability to efficiently realize income or capital gains and may subject us or the stockholders to tax and return filing obligations in such countries. The tax consequences applicable to a stockholder will depend upon the particular situation of such stockholder.\nWe will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on all of our income if we are unable to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nAlthough we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, there can be no assurances that we will be able to qualify for and maintain RIC status. To obtain and maintain RIC status and be relieved of U.S. federal income taxes on income and gains distributed to stockholders, we must, among other things, meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the 90% Gross Income Test and the Diversification Tests (each as defined and explained more fully in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K \"Business - Election to be Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company.\").\nIf we fail to qualify for or maintain our RIC status for any reason, and we do not qualify for certain relief provisions under the Code, we would be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes). In this event, the resulting taxes and any resulting penalties could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of our income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions to stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. For additional discussion regarding the tax implications of a RIC, see Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K \"Business - Election to be Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company.\"\nRisks Relating to our Use of Leverage and our Credit Facilities\nWe borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.\nBorrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for loss on invested equity capital. We expect to continue to use leverage to partially finance our investments, through borrowings from banks and other lenders, which will increase the risks of investing in our Common Stock, including the likelihood of default. We borrow under our credit facilities, and may issue other debt securities or enter into other types of borrowing arrangements in the future. If the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause Net Asset Value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. To the extent we incur additional leverage, these effects would be further magnified, increasing the risk of investing in us. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make Common Stock distributions or scheduled debt payments. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique and we only intend to use leverage if expected returns will exceed the cost of borrowing.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $37.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under our CNB-2 Facility and $220.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Citibank Facility. These debt instruments require periodic payments of interest. The weighted average interest rate charged on our borrowings as of September 30, 2022 was 5.3% (exclusive of deferred financing costs). We will need to generate sufficient cash flow to make these required interest payments. In order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our September 30, 2022 total assets of at least 2.3%. If we are unable to meet the financial obligations under our credit facilities, the lenders under the credit facilities will have a superior claim to our assets over our stockholders.\nIllustration. The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing below.\nAssumed Return on Portfolio (Net of Expenses) - 10% - 5% 0% 5% 10%\nCorresponding net return to common stockholder -22.18 -13.19 -4.20 4.79 13.79\nFor purposes of this table, we have assumed $578.9 million in total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities), $257.0 million in debt outstanding, $321.9 million in net assets as of September 30, 2022, and a weighted average interest rate of 5.3% as of September 30, 2022 (exclusive of deferred financing costs). Actual interest payments may be different.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our credit facilities.\nAs of September 30, 2022, substantially all of our assets were pledged as collateral under our credit facilities and may be pledged as collateral under future credit facilities. If we default on our obligations under these facilities, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests or their superior claim. In such event, we may be forced to sell our investments to raise funds to repay our outstanding borrowings in order to avoid foreclosure and these forced sales may be at times and at prices we would not consider advantageous. Moreover, such deleveraging of our company could significantly impair our ability to effectively operate our business in the manner in which we have historically operated. As a result, we could be forced to curtail or cease new investment activities and lower or eliminate the distributions that we have historically paid to our stockholders.\nWe own 100% of the equity interests in OSI 2 SPV, the borrower under the Citibank Facility. We consolidate the financial statements of OSI 2 SPV in our consolidated financial statements and treat the indebtedness of this entity as our leverage. Our interest in OSI 2 SPV is subordinated in priority of payment to every other obligation of OSI 2 SPV and is subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in the Citibank Facility. We receive cash distributions on our equity interest in this entity only if it has made all required cash interest payments to the lenders and no default exists. We cannot assure you that distributions on the assets held by OSI 2 SPV will be sufficient to make any distributions to us or that such distributions will meet our expectations.\nWe receive cash from OSI 2 SPV only to the extent that we receive distributions on our equity interest in such entity. OSI 2 SPV may make distributions on its equity interests only to the extent permitted by the payment priority provisions of the\nCitibank Facility, which generally provides that payments on such interests may not be made on any payment date unless all amounts owing to the lenders and other secured parties are paid in full.\nIn addition, if the lenders exercise their right to sell the assets pledged under the Citibank Facility, such sales may be completed at distressed sale prices, thereby diminishing or potentially eliminating the amount of cash available to us after repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Citibank Facility.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before it matures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or seeking additional equity. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would not be disadvantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.\nRisks Relating to our External Management\nWe are dependent upon our Adviser for future success.\nOur success depends in substantial part on the management, skill and acumen of the Adviser and the Investment Professionals. Investment in the Common Stock is a passive investment, and stockholders have no opportunity to control our day-to-day operations, including investment and disposition decisions. The Adviser and the Investment Professionals evaluate, negotiate, structure, execute, monitor and service our investments. Subjective decisions made by Oaktree may cause us to incur losses or to miss profit opportunities on which we would otherwise have capitalized. In order to safeguard their limited liability for our liabilities and obligations, stockholders must rely entirely on the Adviser to conduct and manage our affairs. stockholders have no direct rights against third parties engaged by Oaktree in respect of us.\nThe Advisers capabilities in structuring the investment process, providing competent, attentive and efficient services to us, and facilitating access to financing on acceptable terms depend on the employment of the Investment Professionals in adequate number and of adequate sophistication to match the corresponding flow of transactions. There can be no assurance that the Investment Professionals (including the Key Executives) and such other professionals will continue to be employed by Oaktree. The loss of any of the Investment Professionals and other professionals could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, certain of the Investment Professionals are also responsible for investing and managing the capital of certain Other Oaktree Funds, which require that such Investment Professionals devote considerable time to such Other Oaktree Funds instead of us. The Adviser may need to hire, train, supervise and manage new investment professionals to participate in the investment selection and monitoring process and may not be able to find investment professionals in a timely manner or at all.\nIn addition, our Adviser may resign on 60 days notice. If we are unable to quickly find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms, our operations are likely to experience a disruption and our ability to achieve our investment objective and pay distributions would likely be materially and adversely affected.\nConflicts of interest may exist from time to time between our Adviser and certain of its affiliates involved with us, which could impact our investment returns.\nOur executive officers and directors, and certain members of our Adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, or of investment funds managed by Oaktrees affiliates. For example, Oaktree presently serves as the investment adviser to OCSL. OCSL has historically invested in debt and debt-like instruments similar to those we target for investment. Therefore, there may be certain investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria for OCSL and us. OCSL operates as distinct and separate entity, and any investment in Common Stock will not be an investment in OCSL. In addition, all of our executive officers serve in substantially similar capacities for OCSL. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in our best interests or the best interests of the stockholders. For example, the personnel of the Adviser may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and such other funds and accounts.\nOaktree has investment allocation guidelines that govern the allocation of investment opportunities among the investment funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by Oaktree and its affiliates. To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for us, OCSL or any of the Other Oaktree Funds, Oaktree will adhere to its investment allocation guidelines in order to determine a fair and equitable allocation.\nWe invest alongside funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by our Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price or terms related to price.\nIn addition, on October 18, 2017, our former adviser received exemptive relief from the SEC to allow certain managed funds and accounts, each of whose investment adviser is OCM or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with OCM, to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions where doing so is consistent with the applicable registered funds or BDCs investment objective and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the Exemptive Relief. Each potential co-investment opportunity that falls under the terms of the Exemptive Relief and is appropriate for us and any affiliated fund or account, and satisfies the then-current board-established criteria, will be offered to us and such other eligible funds and accounts. If there is a sufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated among the participants in accordance with their proposed order size and if there is an insufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated pro rata based on the investment proposed by the applicable investment adviser to such participant, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each, which is reviewed and approved by an independent committee of legal, compliance and accounting professionals at the Adviser. Although Oaktree will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and the stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated to other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of the Adviser. We might not participate in each individual opportunity, but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities managed by Oaktree and its affiliates. Oaktree seeks to treat all clients fairly and equitably such that none receive preferential treatment vis-\u00e0-vis the others over time, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain funds or accounts receive allocations where others do not.\nPursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Advisers liability is limited and we are required to indemnify our Adviser against certain liabilities. This may lead our Adviser to act in a riskier manner in performing its duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement than it would if it were acting for its own account, and creates a potential conflict of interest.\nPursuant to the Administration Agreement, our Administrator furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive office, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We pay our Administrator our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Administrator or such affiliate in performing its obligations and services under the Administration Agreement, such as rent and our allocable portion of the cost of personnel attributable to performing such obligations and services, including, but not limited to, marketing, legal and other services performed by our Administrator or such affiliate for us. This arrangement creates conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor.\nOur Adviser may face conflicts of interest in choosing our service providers and financing sources, and certain service providers may provide services to our Adviser or Other Oaktree Funds on more favorable terms than those payable by us.\nConflicts of interest may exist with respect to the Advisers selection of brokers, dealers and transaction agents and counterparties (collectively, Broker-Dealers) and financing sources for the execution of our transactions. When engaging the services of Broker-Dealers and financing sources, the Adviser may, subject to best execution, take into consideration a variety of factors, including, to the extent applicable, the ability to achieve prompt and reliable execution, competitive pricing, transaction costs, operational efficiency with which transactions are effected, access to deal flow and precedent transactions, and the financial stability and reputation of the particular Broker-Dealer, as well as other factors that the Adviser deems appropriate to consider under the circumstances. Broker-Dealers and financing sources may provide other services that are beneficial to Oaktree and their affiliates, but that are not necessarily beneficial to us, including capital introductions, other marketing assistance, client and personnel referrals, consulting services, and research-related services. These other services and items may influence the Advisers selection of Broker-Dealers and financing sources.\nOur Incentive Fee may induce our Adviser to pursue speculative investments.\nThe fact that the Incentive Fee is based on our performance may create an incentive for Oaktree to make investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of the Incentive Fee. The way in which the Incentive Fee is determined may encourage Oaktree to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase our likelihood of default, which would disfavor stockholders, and could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.\nIn addition, the Investment Income Incentive Fee payable to Oaktree is computed and paid on income that may include interest income that has been accrued but not yet received in cash, such as OID interest, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities and obligations. As a result, for any calendar quarter, the Investment Income Incentive Fee that is paid to Oaktree may be calculated on the basis of an amount that is greater than the amount of net investment income actually received by us for such calendar quarter. This fee structure may be considered to involve a conflict of interest for Oaktree to the extent that it may encourage Oaktree to favor debt financings that provide for deferred interest, rather than current cash payments of interest. Oaktree may have an incentive for us to invest in deferred interest securities or obligations in circumstances where it would not have done so but for the opportunity to continue to earn the Investment Income Incentive Fee even when the issuers of the deferred interest securities or obligations would not be able to make actual cash payments on such securities and obligations. Moreover, certain of the types of investments within our investment objective, such as PIK toggle debt, may result in a PIK election, which may have the simultaneous effect of increasing the assets under management, thereby increasing the Management Fee, and increasing investment income, thus increasing the Incentive Fee.\nThis risk could be increased because Oaktree is not obligated to reimburse us for any distributions of Incentive Fees previously received even if we subsequently incur losses or never receive in cash the deferred income that was previously accrued. Thus, while the stockholders will share in both the risks and rewards of investing in such instruments, Oaktree will not share in such risks.\nIn the event that losses are allocated to us for a given annual period, Oaktree is not required to reduce the Incentive Fee credited for prior annual periods. Stockholders should also be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can generally be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for the Hurdle Rate to be met or exceeded and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of Incentive Fee payable to Oaktree with respect to the Investment Income Incentive Fee without a corresponding increase in performance relative to the market as a whole.\nNo index will be used as a comparative measure of investment performance as a basis for calculating the Incentive Fee.\nIn addition, Oaktree will be entitled to the portion of the Incentive Fee for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for that quarter above a threshold return for that quarter. For these purposes, Oaktrees Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income excludes realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation that we may incur in the fiscal quarter, even if such capital losses result in a net loss for us for that quarter. Thus, we may be required to pay Oaktree the Incentive Fee for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or we incur a net loss for that quarter. If we pay an Incentive Fee of 20% of realized capital gains (net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation) and thereafter experience additional realized capital losses or unrealized capital depreciation, we will not be able to recover any portion of the Incentive Fee previously paid.\nOur Management Fee may induce our Adviser to incur leverage.\nOaktrees Management Fee is based on our Gross Asset Value, including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. The Adviser may, therefore, be incentivized to increase such borrowing to increase the Management Fee. Under certain circumstances, the use of increased leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor stockholders.\nOur ability to enter into transactions with Oaktree and our other affiliates is restricted.\nWe and certain of our controlled affiliates are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our upstream affiliates, or our Adviser and its affiliates, without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is our upstream affiliate for purposes of the Investment Company Act and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security (other than our securities) from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of our independent directors. The Investment Company Act also prohibits joint transactions with an upstream affiliate, or our\nAdviser or its affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our independent directors. In addition, we and certain of our controlled affiliates are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to, or entering into joint transactions with, our Adviser and its affiliates, or any person who owns more than 25% of our voting securities or is otherwise deemed to control, be controlled by, or be under common control with us, absent the prior approval of the SEC through an exemptive order (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance as described below). The analysis of whether a particular transaction constitutes a joint transaction requires a review of the relevant facts and circumstances then existing.\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For example, we are not generally permitted to invest in any portfolio company in which a fund managed by Oaktree or any of its downstream affiliates (other than us and our downstream affiliates) currently has an investment, or make any co-investments with our Adviser or its affiliates, including any fund managed by Oaktree or any of its downstream affiliates (other than us and our downstream affiliates), without exemptive relief from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. The SEC has granted our former adviser and certain of its affiliates Exemptive Relief that permits certain present and future funds advised by OCM (or a future investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with OCM), including us, to co-invest in suitable negotiated investments. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. On December 15, 2020, we, with the Adviser and certain other affiliates, received a modified exemptive order that allows Oaktree proprietary accounts to participate in co-investment transactions subject to certain conditions. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Oaktree or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Advisers allocation policies and procedures.\nIn addition to co-investing pursuant to the Exemptive Relief, we may invest alongside affiliates or their affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and current regulatory guidance. For example, we may invest alongside such investors consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff permitting us and an affiliated person to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that we negotiate no term other than price. We may, in certain cases, also make investments in securities owned by affiliates that we acquire from non-affiliates. In such circumstances, our ability to participate in any restructuring of such investment or other transaction involving the issuer of such investment may be limited, and as a result, we may realize a loss on such investments that might have been prevented or reduced had we not been restricted in participating in such restructuring or other transaction.\nOur Adviser or its affiliates may, from time to time, possess material non-public information, limiting our investment discretion.\nBy reason of their responsibilities in connection with us and the Other Oaktree Funds, personnel of our Adviser or its affiliates may acquire confidential or material non-public information or be restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. Our Adviser or its affiliate, as applicable, will not be free to act upon any such information. Due to these restrictions, we may not be able to initiate a transaction that we otherwise might have initiated and may not be able to sell an investment that we otherwise might have sold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Adviser may determine, in its sole discretion at any time, that such information could impair its ability to effect certain transactions on our behalf, whether for legal, contractual, or other reasons. Accordingly, our Adviser may elect not to receive such information. Lack of access to any such information may adversely affect our investments that in some cases may have been avoided had we or our Adviser had such information.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe shares of Common Stock are generally an illiquid investment.\nStockholders generally are not permitted to sell their shares of Common Stock prior to a Liquidity Event, if any, and Common Stock may only be Transferred with our permission. In some circumstances, stockholders are not permitted to Transfer their Common Stock without our permission for a period of time following a Qualified Listing as set forth in the Subscription Agreement. In addition, stockholders have no right to cause us to repurchase their shares of Common Stock.\nThere is a risk that our stockholders may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time.\nWe intend to pay distributions to stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure stockholders that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to sustain a specified level of cash distributions or periodic increases in cash distributions. In addition, the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC can limit our ability to pay distributions. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, compliance with applicable BDC\nregulations and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure stockholders that we will pay distributions to them.\nIn addition, although under normal circumstances, we intend to make distributions in cash, it is possible that under certain circumstances (including our liquidation), distributions may be made in kind and could consist of securities or other investments for which there is no readily available public market.\nA stockholders interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares of Common Stock, which could reduce the overall value of an investment in us.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing more Common Stock or by issuing senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, Common Stock, the percentage ownership of then-existing stockholders that do not participate in those transactions will decline at that time and such stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of us.\nRisks Relating to the Mergers\nBecause the market price of OCSL Common Stock will fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the consideration they will receive in connection with the Mergers until the closing date of the Mergers.\nAt the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by OCSL or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, the Cancelled Shares) will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of OCSL (OCSL Common Stock) equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), plus any cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares. The market value of such consideration to be received by our stockholders upon completion of the Mergers (the Merger Consideration) may vary from the closing price OCSL Common Stock, respectively, on the date the Mergers were announced, on the date of the special meeting of our stockholders to consider the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Mergers (the Special Meeting), and on the date the Mergers are completed. Any change in the market price of OCSL Common Stock prior to completion of the Mergers will affect the market value of the Merger Consideration that our stockholders will receive upon completion of the Mergers. Additionally, the Exchange Ratio will fluctuate as our and OCSLs respective net asset values change prior to the closing date of the Mergers.\nAccordingly, at the time of the Special Meeting, our stockholders will not know or be able to calculate the market value of the Merger Consideration they would receive upon completion of the Mergers. Neither we nor OCSL is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement or resolicit the vote of our respective stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of shares of OCSL Common Stock. There will be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration for changes in the market price of shares of OCSL Common Stock.\nChanges in the market price of OCSL Common Stock may result from a variety of factors, including, among other things:\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in OCSLs sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;\ninability to obtain any exemptive relief that may be required by OCSL from the SEC;\nchanges in regulatory policies, accounting pronouncements or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs and BDCs;\nloss of OCSLs BDC or RIC status;\nchanges in earnings or variations in operating results or distributions that exceed OCSLs net investment income;\nincreases in expenses associated with defense of litigation and responding to SEC inquiries;\nchanges in accounting guidelines governing valuation of OCSLs investments;\nchanges in the value of OCSLs portfolio of investments and any derivative instruments, including as a result of general economic conditions, interest rate shifts and changes in the performance of OCSLs portfolio companies;\nany shortfall in investment income or net investment income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\ndeparture of Oaktrees key personnel; and\ngeneral economic trends and other external factors.\nThese factors are generally beyond the control of OCSL and may not relate to OCSLs operating performance. The range of high and low closing sales prices per share of OCSL Common Stock as reported on Nasdaq for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was a low of $5.87 and a high of $7.25. However, historical trading prices are not necessarily indicative of\nfuture performance. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of OCSL Common Stock prior to the Special Meeting.\nSales of shares of OCSL Common Stock after the completion of the Mergers may cause the trading price of OCSL Common Stock to decline.\nFor illustrative purposes, based on September 30, 2022 net asset values and excluding transaction costs and other tax-related distributions, OCSL would issue approximately 2.72 shares of OCSL Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement for each share of our common stock outstanding, resulting in pro forma ownership of 20.5% for our current stockholders and 79.5% for current OCSL stockholders. Following completion of the Mergers, certain of our former stockholders may be required to or decide to sell the shares of OCSL Common Stock that they receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In addition, OCSLs stockholders may decide not to hold their shares of OCSL Common Stock after completion of the Mergers. In each case, such sales of OCSL Common Stock could have the effect of depressing the trading price for OCSL Common Stock and may take place promptly following the completion of the Mergers. If this occurs, it could impair OCSLs ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities should OCSL desire to do so.\nOur stockholders will experience a reduction in percentage ownership and voting power in the combined company as a result of the Mergers.\nOur stockholders will experience a substantial reduction in their percentage ownership interests and effective voting power in respect of the combined company relative to their percentage ownership interests in us prior to the Mergers. Consequently, our stockholders should expect to exercise less influence over the management and policies of the combined company following the Mergers than they currently exercise over our management and policies. In addition, prior to completion of the Mergers, subject to certain restrictions in the Merger Agreement, we and OCSL may issue additional shares of our common stock and OCSL Common Stock, respectively, which would further reduce the percentage ownership of the combined company to be held by our current stockholders.\nAfter completion of the Mergers, OCSL may issue additional shares of OCSL Common Stock at prices below OCSL Common Stocks then-current NAV per share, subject to certain restrictions under the Investment Company Act, including stockholder approval of such issuance. The issuance or sale by OCSL of shares of OCSL Common Stock at a discount to NAV poses a risk of dilution to stockholders.\nOCSL may be unable to realize the benefits anticipated by the Mergers, including estimated cost savings, or it may take longer than anticipated to achieve such benefits.\nThe realization of certain benefits anticipated as a result of the Mergers will depend in part on the integration of our investment portfolio with OCSLs investment portfolio, the integration of our business with OCSLs business and the ability to rotate certain of our current investments into higher yielding assets. There can be no assurance that our investment portfolio or business can be operated profitably or integrated successfully into OCSLs operations in a timely fashion or at all. The dedication of management resources to such integration may detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company and there can be no assurance that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or there will not be other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts. Such effects, including incurring unexpected costs or delays in connection with such integration and failure of our investment portfolio to perform as expected, could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the combined company.\nOCSL also expects to achieve certain synergies and cost savings from the Mergers when the two companies have fully integrated their portfolios. It is possible that the estimates of these potential synergies and cost savings could ultimately be incorrect. The cost savings estimates also assume OCSL will be able to combine our operations and OCSLs operations in a manner that permits those cost savings to be fully realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or if OCSL is not able to successfully combine our investment portfolio or business with OCSLs operations, the anticipated synergies and cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe opinion delivered to the Special Committee and our board of directors from the financial advisor to the Special Committee will not reflect changes in circumstances between the signing of the Merger Agreement and completion of the Mergers.\nThe opinion of the financial advisor to a special committee comprised solely of certain of our independent directors, or the Special Committee, was delivered to the Special Committee and our board of directors on, and was dated, September 14, 2022. Changes in our or OCSLs operations and prospects, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of us or OCSL may significantly alter our value or the price of shares of OCSL Common Stock by the time\nthe Mergers are completed. The opinion does not speak as of the time the Mergers will be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion.\nIf the Mergers do not close, we will not benefit from the expenses incurred in pursuit of the Mergers.\nThe Mergers may not be completed. If the Mergers are not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received. We have incurred out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Mergers for investment banking, legal and accounting fees and financial printing and other related charges, much of which will be incurred even if the Mergers are not completed.\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences, including:\nour business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Mergers, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Mergers; and\nwe may not be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the price OCSL agreed to pay in the Mergers.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Mergers.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of us. These provisions, which are typical for transactions of this type, include a termination fee of $9.8 million payable by third parties to OCSL under certain circumstances, might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the Mergers or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nThe Mergers are subject to closing conditions, including stockholder approvals, that, if not satisfied or (to the extent legally allowed) waived, will result in the Mergers not being completed, which may result in material adverse consequences to our business and operations.\nThe Mergers are subject to closing conditions, including certain approvals of our and OCSLs respective stockholders that, if not satisfied, will prevent the Mergers from being completed. The closing condition that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Mergers may not be waived under applicable law and must be satisfied for the Mergers to be completed. If our stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Mergers and the Mergers are not completed, the resulting failure of the Mergers could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition, the closing condition that OCSLs stockholders approve the issuance of shares of OCSL Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement may not be waived and must be satisfied for the Mergers to be completed. If OCSLs stockholders do not approve the issuance of shares of OCSL Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the Mergers are not completed, the resulting failure of the Mergers could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. In addition to the required approvals of our and OCSLs stockholders, the Mergers are subject to a number of other conditions beyond our control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect completion of the Mergers. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied.\nWe may, to the extent legally allowed, waive one or more conditions to the Mergers without resoliciting stockholder approval.\nCertain conditions to our obligations to complete the Mergers may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent legally allowed, either unilaterally or by agreement of us and OCSL. In the event that any such waiver does not require re-solicitation of stockholders, we will have the discretion to complete the Mergers without seeking further stockholder approval. The conditions requiring the approval of our and OCSLs stockholders, however, cannot be waived.\nWe will be subject to operational uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Mergers are pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Mergers may have an adverse effect on us and, consequently, on the combined company following completion of the Mergers. These uncertainties may cause those that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking actions that we might otherwise consider to be in our best interests. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Mergers.\nThe market price of OCSL Common Stock after the Mergers may be affected by factors different from those affecting OCSL Common Stock currently.\nOur business and OCSLs business differ in some respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of OCSL Common Stock after the Mergers may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations, such as a larger stockholder base, a different portfolio composition and a different capital structure.\nAccordingly, OCSLs historical trading prices and financial results may not be indicative of such matters for the combined company following the Mergers.\nIf we have not consummated Liquidity Event, including the Mergers, by the end of the Investment Period, our board of directors (to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duties and subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will meet to consider our potential wind down and/or liquidation and dissolution.\nIf we have not consummated a Liquidity Event, including the Mergers, by the end of the Investment Period, our board of directors (to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duties and subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act) will meet to consider our potential wind down and/or liquidation and dissolution. To the extent our Board determines to pursue a liquidation or dissolution, no assurances can be provided as to what price they will be able to obtain from selling or liquidating our investments and we could end up being liquidated below our then NAV per share or at a price per share below what stockholders paid.\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, our common stockholders would receive any remaining net assets only after payment or provision or payment of our debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. In addition, we expect that we would incur certain costs associated with a liquidation or dissolution. Accordingly, to the extent our board of directors determines to proceed with our liquidation or dissolution, it could result in a loss for our common stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGeneral economic and market conditions, including those caused by inflation and a rising interest rate environment, could materially affect the success of our activities and investments.\nAny disruptions in the capital markets, as a result of inflation and a rising interest environment or otherwise, may increase the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities and can result in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial sector and re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated market. These and any other unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. During the spring of 2020, the occurrence of these events during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the fair value of the investments that we held and, if they were to occur again in the future, could limit our investment originations (including as a result of the investment professionals of our Adviser diverting their time to the restructuring of certain investments), negatively impact our operating results and limit our ability to grow. More recently, the fair value of our investments has been adversely affected by increasing market yields.\nIn addition, market conditions (including inflation, supply chain issues and decreased consumer demand) have adversely impacted, and could in the future further impact, the operations of certain of our portfolio companies. If the financial results of middle-market companies, like those in which we invest, experience deterioration, it could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults, and further deterioration in market conditions will further depress the outlook for those companies. Further, adverse economic conditions decreased and may in the future decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Such conditions have required and may in the future require us to modify the payment terms of our investments, including changes in PIK interest provisions and/or cash interest rates. The performance of certain of our portfolio companies has been, and in the future may be, negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions, which can result in our receipt of reduced interest income from our portfolio companies and/or realized and unrealized losses related to our investments, and, in turn, may adversely affect distributable income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic recessions or downturns may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could impair the ability of our portfolio companies to repay debt or pay interest.\nEconomic recessions or downturns may result in a prolonged period of market illiquidity which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions, including\nsustained inflation and rising interest rates, also have and could further increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, uncertainty with regard to economic recovery from recessions or downturns could also have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen recessionary conditions exist, the financial results of middle-market companies, like those in which we invest, typically experience deterioration, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults. Additionally, there can be reduced demand for certain of our portfolio companies products and services and/or other economic consequences, such as decreased margins or extended payment terms. Further, adverse economic conditions may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Such conditions may require us to modify the payment terms of our investments, including changes in PIK interest provisions and/or cash interest rates. The performance of certain of our portfolio companies has been, and in the future may be, negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions, which may result in our receipt of reduced interest income from our portfolio companies and/or realized and unrealized losses related to our investments, and, in turn, may adversely affect distributable income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions, including downgrades of the U.S. credit rating and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.\nThe current worldwide financial market situation, as well as various social and political tensions in the United States and around the world, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may contribute to increased market volatility, may have long-term effects on the United States and worldwide financial markets and may cause economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. The impact of downgrades by rating agencies to the U.S. governments sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness as well as potential government shutdowns and uncertainty surrounding transfers of power could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. In addition, disagreement over the federal budget has caused the U.S. federal government to shut down for periods of time. Continued adverse political and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeterioration in the economic conditions in the Eurozone and other regions or countries globally and the resulting instability in global financial markets may pose a risk to our business. Financial markets have been affected at times by a number of global macroeconomic events, including the following: large sovereign debts and fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe and in emerging markets jurisdictions, levels of non-performing loans on the balance sheets of European banks, the effect of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, instability in the Chinese capital markets and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVarious social and political circumstances in the U.S. and around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics), may also contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. Such events, including rising trade tensions between the United States and China, other uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign, trade, economic and other policies with other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These market and economic disruptions could negatively impact the operating results of our portfolio companies.\nIn addition, Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and corresponding events have had, and could continue to have, severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets. Following Russias actions, various governments, including the United States, have issued broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia, including, among other actions, a prohibition on doing business with certain Russian companies, large financial institutions, officials and oligarchs; a commitment by certain countries and the European Union to remove selected Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, the electronic banking network that connects banks globally; and restrictive measures to prevent the Russian Central Bank from undermining the impact of the sanctions. The duration of hostilities and the vast array of sanctions and related events (including cyberattacks and espionage) cannot be predicted. Those events present material uncertainty and risk with respect to markets globally, which pose potential adverse risks to us and the performance of our investments and operations. Any such market disruptions could affect our portfolio companies operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserves actions with respect to raising short term interest rates and future interest rate increases, along with the United States governments credit and deficit concerns, global economic uncertainties and market\nvolatility and the impacts of COVID-19, could cause interest rates to be volatile, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets and capital markets on favorable terms. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nWe do not own any real estate or other physical properties material to our operations. Our administrative and principal executive offices are located at 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is presently conducted. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, and, to our knowledge, no material legal proceeding is threatened against us. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nThere is no public market for our Common Stock currently, nor are there any plans for one to develop.\nHolders\nAs of December 13, 2022, there were 1,752 holders of record of our Common Stock.\nDistributions\nWe anticipate that we will make quarterly distributions of at least 90% of our realized net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, if any, then available for distribution, each as determined by our board of directors in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Governing Documents. Any distributions will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We expect quarterly distributions to be paid from income primarily generated by interest and dividends earned on our investments, although distributions to stockholders may also include a return of capital.\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain RIC qualification, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each tax year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income for that year. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year\u037e (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year\u037e and, (3) any undistributed ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax less certain over-distributions in prior years. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses), if any, at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment, pay U.S. federal income tax on such amounts at regular corporate tax rates, and elect to treat such gains as deemed distributions to stockholders. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, to the extent that we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the Investment Company Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.\nDepending on the level of taxable income and net capital gain earned in a year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income or net capital gain for distribution in the following year and pay the applicable U.S. federal excise tax. Distributions will be appropriately adjusted for any taxes payable by us or any direct or indirect subsidiary through which it invests (including any corporate, state, local, non-U.S. and withholding taxes). Any Incentive Fee to be paid to our Adviser will not be reduced to take into account any such taxes.\nSales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds\nWe did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Form 10-K that were not registered under the Securities Act. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot applicable. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act) and have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Code).\nWe were formed on April 30, 2018 as a Delaware corporation and are externally managed by our Adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement) between us and our Adviser, which was approved by our board of directors most recently on August 6, 2021. From July 9, 2018 through May 11, 2020, we were managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., an affiliate of our Adviser. We seek to invest opportunistically across asset classes and geographies, primarily in the form of senior loans, and to a lesser extent, high yield bonds, to borrowers that are in need of direct loans, rescue financings or other capital solutions or that have had challenged or unsuccessful primary offerings. Our investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. We seek to achieve our investment objective without subjecting principal to undue risk of loss by investing primarily in situations where a company or its owners (a) are overleveraged or facing pressures to recapitalize, (b) are unable to access broadly syndicated capital markets, (c) are undervalued after having recently exited bankruptcy or completed a restructuring or (d) are otherwise affected by mispricings or inefficiencies in the capital markets or at different points throughout the credit cycle. We seek to generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold.\nIn the current market environment, Oaktree intends to focus primarily on the following areas, in which Oaktree believes there is less competition and thus potential for greater returns, for new investment opportunities: (1) situational lending, which we define to include directly originated loans to non-sponsor companies that are hard to understand and value using traditional underwriting techniques, (2) select sponsor lending, which we define to include financing to support leveraged buyouts of companies with specialized sponsors that have expertise in certain industries, and (3) stressed sector and rescue lending, which we define to include opportunistic private loans in industries experiencing stress or limited access to capital.\nWe conducted private offerings (each, a Private Offering) of shares of our common stock (\"Common Stock\") to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). At each Closing of a Private Offering, each investor participating in that closing made a capital commitment (each, a Capital Commitment\") to purchase our Common Stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us in connection with its Capital Commitment (Subscription Agreement). Investors were required to fund drawdowns to purchase our Common Stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitments on an as-needed basis with a minimum of ten calendar days' prior notice (excluding the initial drawdown for each investor). The initial closing of a Private Offering occurred on August 6, 2018 (the Initial Closing). We commenced our loan origination and investment activities shortly after our initial capital drawdown from our non-affiliated investors (the \"Initial Drawdown\"). The proceeds from the Initial Drawdown provided us with the necessary seed capital to commence operations. As of September 30, 2022, we completed drawdowns of $337,558,996, or 100%, of Capital Commitments from investors in connection with Private Offerings, of which $3,854,346 in Capital Commitments were made by one or more affiliates of the Adviser.\nBusiness Environment and Developments\nGlobal financial markets have experienced an increase in volatility as concerns about the impact of higher inflation, rising interest rates, a potential recession, the current conflict in Ukraine and the ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic have weighed on market participants. These factors have created disruptions in supply chains and economic activity and have had a particularly adverse impact on certain companies in the energy, raw materials and transportation sectors, among others. These uncertainties can ultimately impact the overall supply and demand of the market through changing spreads, deal terms and structures and equity purchase price multiples.\nWe are unable to predict the full effects of these macroeconomic events or how long any further market disruptions or volatility might last. We continue to closely monitor the impact these events have on our business, industry and portfolio companies and will provide constructive solutions where necessary.\nAgainst this uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, we believe attractive risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by making loans to middle market companies that typically possess resilient business models with strong underlying fundamentals. Given the breadth of the investment platform and decades of credit investing experience of Oaktree and its affiliates, we believe that we have the resources and experience to source, diligence and structure investments in these companies and are well placed to generate attractive returns for investors.\nAs of September 30, 2022, 91.5% of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) and 91.8% of our debt investment portfolio (at cost) bore interest at floating rates. Most of our floating rate loans are indexed to the LIBOR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly or monthly at the borrowers option. Certain loans are also indexed to the Sterling Overnight Index Average (\"SONIA\"), an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, supports replacing U.S.-dollar LIBOR with SOFR. Although there have been issuances utilizing SOFR or SONIA, it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR. In anticipation of the cessation of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements extending beyond the applicable phase out date with our prospective portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. Certain of the loan agreements with our portfolio companies have included fallback language in the event that LIBOR becomes unavailable. This language generally provides that the administrative agent may identify a replacement reference rate, typically with the consent of (or prior consultation with) the borrower. In certain cases, the administrative agent will be required to obtain the consent of either a majority of the lenders under the facility, or the consent of each lender, prior to identifying a replacement reference rate. Certain of the loan agreements with our portfolio companies do not include any fallback language providing a mechanism for the parties to negotiate a new reference interest rate and will instead revert to the base rate in the event LIBOR ceases to exist.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nFair Value Measurements\nOur Adviser, as the valuation designee of our board of directors pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, determines the fair value of our assets on at least a quarterly basis in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the Adviser's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\nIf inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Adviser's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, the Adviser obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers for all of our investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing vendors and brokers use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nThe Adviser seeks to obtain at least two quotations for the subject or similar securities, typically from pricing vendors. If the Adviser is unable to obtain two quotes from pricing vendors, or if the prices obtained from pricing vendors are not within the Adviser's set threshold, the Adviser seeks to obtain a quote directly from a broker making a market for the asset. The Adviser evaluates the quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers based on available market information, including\ntrading activity of the subject or similar securities, or by performing a comparable security analysis to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. The Adviser also performs back-testing of valuation information obtained from pricing vendors and brokers against actual prices received in transactions. In addition to ongoing monitoring and back-testing, the Adviser performs due diligence procedures over pricing vendors to understand their methodology and controls to support their use in the valuation process. Generally, the Adviser does not adjust any of the prices received from these sources.\nIf the quotations obtained from pricing vendors or brokers are determined not to be reliable or are not readily available, the Adviser values such investments using any of three different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is the transaction precedent technique, which utilizes recent or expected future transactions of the investment to determine fair value, to the extent applicable. The second valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value (\"EV\") of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The EV analysis is typically performed to determine (i) the value of equity investments, (ii) whether there is credit impairment for debt investments and (iii) the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the Investment Company Act. To estimate the EV of a portfolio company, the Adviser analyzes various factors, including the portfolio companys historical and projected financial results, macroeconomic impacts on the company and competitive dynamics in the companys industry. the Adviser also utilizes some or all of the following information based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company: (i) valuations of comparable public companies, (ii) recent sales of private and public comparable companies in similar industries or having similar business or earnings characteristics, (iii) purchase prices as a multiple of their earnings or cash flow, (iv) the portfolio companys ability to meet its forecasts and its business prospects, (v) a discounted cash flow analysis, (vi) estimated liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets and (vii) offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company. The Adviser may probability weight potential sale outcomes with respect to a portfolio company when uncertainty exists as of the valuation date. The third valuation technique is a market yield technique, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. In the market yield technique, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk, and the Adviser considers the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to our risk and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Adviser depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nThe Adviser estimates the fair value of certain privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions, including the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nIn December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. Rule 2a-5 permits boards of directors of registered investment companies and BDCs to either (i) choose to continue to determine fair value in good faith, or (ii) designate a valuation designee tasked with determining fair value in good faith, subject to the boards oversight. Our board of directors has designated the Adviser to serve as its valuation designee effective September 8, 2022.\nThe Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments:\nThe quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Adviser's valuation team;\nPreliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of the Adviser;\nSeparately, independent valuation firms prepare valuations of the our investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to the Adviser;\nThe Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee;\nThe Audit Committee reviews the valuation report with the Adviser, and the Adviser responds and supplements the valuation report to reflect any discussions between the Adviser and the Audit Committee; and\nThe Adviser, as valuation designee, determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio.\nThe fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2022 was determined by the Adviser, as our valuation designee, and the fair value of our investments as of September 30, 2021 was determined in good faith by our board of directors. We have and will continue to engage independent valuation firms each quarter to provide assistance regarding the determination of the\nfair value of a portion of its portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.\nWith the exception of the line items entitled \"deferred financing costs,\" \"other assets,\" \"deferred tax liability,\" \"secured borrowings\" and \"credit facilities payable,\" which are reported at amortized cost, all assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying value of the line items titled \"interest receivable,\" \"receivables from unsettled transactions,\" \"accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities,\" \"base management fee and incentive fees payable,\" \"due to affiliates,\" \"interest payable\" and \"payables from unsettled transactions\" approximate fair value due to their short maturities.\nAs of September 30, 2022, investments at fair value were $559,313,056, down from $575,429,432 held at September 30, 2021, primarily driven by unrealized losses related to credit spread widening during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date.\nInterest Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount (\"OID\"), is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. We stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or a return of capital depending upon managements judgment. A non-accrual investment is restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and the portfolio company, in managements judgment, is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining obligations.\nIn connection with our investment in a portfolio company, we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When we receive nominal cost equity, we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.\nFor our secured borrowings, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within interest income and the interest earned by the counterparty is recorded within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPIK Interest Income\nOur investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which generally represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. Our decision to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; our assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Our determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before our full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in our consolidated financial statements including for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to the Adviser. To\nmaintain our status as a RIC, certain income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to our stockholders even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never do so.\nAs of each of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there were no investments on non-accrual status.\nPortfolio Composition\nAs of September 30, 2022, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $559.3 million and was comprised of investments in 115 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2021, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $575.4 million and was comprised of investments in 108 portfolio companies.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, our investment portfolio consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nCost:\nSenior Secured Debt 97.47 % 97.57 %\nPreferred Equity 1.79 % 1.28 %\nCommon Equity & Warrants 0.52 % 0.46 %\nSubordinated Debt 0.22 % 0.69 %\nTotal 100.00 % 100.00 %\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nFair Value:\nSenior Secured Debt 97.31 % 97.30 %\nPreferred Equity 1.95 % 1.49 %\nCommon Equity & Warrants 0.51 % 0.53 %\nSubordinated Debt 0.23 % 0.68 %\nTotal 100.00 % 100.00 %\nThe table below describes investments by industry composition based on fair value as a percentage of total investments:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nFair Value:\nApplication Software 19.69 % 18.42 %\nPharmaceuticals 5.27 % 6.08 %\nBiotechnology 4.19 % 5.65 %\nIndustrial Machinery 4.07 % 3.65 %\nConstruction & Engineering 3.77 % 3.63 %\nHealth Care Technology 3.14 % 0.98 %\nInternet & Direct Marketing Retail 3.04 % 3.08 %\nAerospace & Defense 2.94 % 2.81 %\nPersonal Products 2.77 % 5.11 %\nData Processing & Outsourced Services 2.76 % 2.74 %\nHealth Care Distributors 2.76 % 0.84 %\nFertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals 2.65 % 3.18 %\nHealth Care Supplies 2.50 % 1.42 %\nAutomotive Retail 2.37 % 1.85 %\nInternet Services & Infrastructure 2.35 % 2.12 %\nInsurance Brokers 2.18 % 2.57 %\nHealth Care Services 2.03 % 2.73 %\nHome Improvement Retail 1.99 % 1.98 %\nAirport Services 1.86 % 1.75 %\nDistributors 1.66 % - %\nMetal & Glass Containers 1.63 % 0.97 %\nIntegrated Telecommunication Services 1.61 % 1.90 %\nReal Estate Services 1.50 % 1.52 %\nSoft Drinks 1.46 % 1.40 %\nCable & Satellite 1.42 % 1.57 %\nMovies & Entertainment 1.38 % 1.37 %\nElectrical Components & Equipment 1.26 % 1.26 %\nLeisure Facilities 1.20 % 0.77 %\nOther Diversified Financial Services 1.18 % 1.11 %\nOil & Gas Storage & Transportation 0.95 % 1.52 %\nReal Estate Operating Companies 0.91 % 1.24 %\nEnvironmental & Facilities Services 0.88 % - %\nEducation Services 0.83 % - %\nSpecialized Finance 0.83 % 0.80 %\nHealth Care Equipment 0.79 % 0.76 %\nDiversified Support Services 0.79 % 0.77 %\nHome Furnishings 0.79 % 0.83 %\nIT Consulting & Other Services 0.74 % 1.00 %\nCommunications Equipment 0.73 % 0.83 %\nHotels, Resorts & Cruise Lines 0.58 % - %\nPaper Packaging 0.58 % - %\nRestaurants 0.56 % 0.59 %\nProperty & Casualty Insurance 0.46 % - %\nConsumer Finance 0.37 % - %\nOil & Gas Refining & Marketing 0.36 % 1.35 %\nLeisure Products 0.36 % 1.41 %\nSystems Software 0.33 % - %\nAir Freight & Logistics 0.24 % - %\nResearch & Consulting Services 0.22 % 0.42 %\nDiversified Banks 0.20 % 0.20 %\nFood Distributors 0.19 % 0.26 %\nAlternative Carriers 0.17 % 0.17 %\nHealth Care Facilities 0.13 % - %\nConstruction Materials 0.12 % 0.15 %\nHousewares & Specialties 0.12 % 0.12 %\nSpecialty Chemicals 0.10 % 0.13 %\nAdvertising 0.04 % - %\nIndependent Power Producers & Energy Traders - % 1.31 %\nAirlines - % 0.74 %\nInteractive Media & Services - % 0.70 %\nManaged Health Care - % 0.68 %\nThrifts & Mortgage Finance - % 0.67 %\nForest Products - % 0.34 %\nElectric Utilities - % 0.27 %\nElectronic Components - % 0.24 %\nFood Retail - % 0.04 %\nTotal 100.00 % 100.00 %\nThe table below describes investments by geographic composition at fair value as a percentage of total investments:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nFair Value:\nUnited States 88.85% 86.07%\nUnited Kingdom 5.47% 5.97%\nSwitzerland 2.15% 2.22%\nAustralia 1.38% 1.37%\nIceland 1.23% 1.19%\nLuxembourg 0.92% 1.70%\nChile -% 0.74%\nSingapore -% 0.70%\nCanada -% 0.04%\nTotal 100.00% 100.00%\nSee the Schedule of Investments as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for more information on these investments, including a list of companies and the type, cost and fair value of investments.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results and Operations\nResults of Operations\nThe principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest income and fee income and total expenses. Net realized gains (losses) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated costs. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation (depreciation) when gains or losses are realized. The net increase or decrease in net assets from operations may vary substantially from period to period as a result of various factors, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation.\nComparison of the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $56,415,159 and consisted of $54,789,935 of interest income primarily from portfolio investments (including $4,233,285 of PIK interest income), $1,600,512 of fee income and $24,712 of dividend income. Total investment income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $49,072,091 and consisted of $44,916,273 of interest income primarily from portfolio investments (including $4,150,838 of PIK interest income) and $4,155,818 of fee income. The increase of $7,343,068 in total investment income, as compared to the prior year, was due to a $9,873,662 increase in interest income, which was due to a larger investment portfolio and a higher yield on investments due to rising reference rates, and a $24,712 increase in dividend income, partially offset by a $2,555,306 decrease in fee income primarily due to lower prepayment fees during the year.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were $23,534,397 and $22,479,260, respectively. The increase in total expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to (1) a $3,501,753 increase in interest expense as a result of higher average borrowings outstanding and the impact of rising reference rates, (2) a $663,842 increase in professional fees primarily as a result of merger related expenses, (3) a $567,387 increase in investment income incentive fees primarily as a result of higher total investment income and (4) a $379,004 increase in base management fees primarily as a result of a higher average investment portfolio, partially offset by a $4,018,372 decrease in accrued capital gains incentive fees as a result of a reversal of previously accrued capital gains incentive fees driven by unrealized losses during the current year.\nYear ended September 30, 2022 Year ended September 30, 2021\nExpenses:\nBase management fee $ 5,656,120 $ 5,277,116\nInvestment income incentive fee 7,723,049 7,155,662\nCapital gains incentive fee (1,988,557) 2,029,815\nProfessional fees 1,694,986 1,031,144\nDirectors fees 155,000 155,000\nInterest expense 8,998,725 5,496,972\nAdministrator expense 462,867 418,580\nGeneral and administrative expenses 832,207 914,971\nTotal expenses $ 23,534,397 $ 22,479,260\nNet Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nNet unrealized depreciation was $24,139,553 for the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to unrealized depreciation across various investments in the portfolio, partially offset by unrealized appreciation on foreign currency forward contracts. Net unrealized appreciation was $7,280,860 for the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to unrealized appreciation across various investments in the portfolio and foreign currency forward contracts.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses)\nNet realized gains were $3,323,075 and $2,992,242 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2022, net realized gains were primarily due to realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts, partially offset by realized losses resulting from exits of various investments in the portfolio. For the year ended September 30, 2021, net realized gains from exits of various investments in the portfolio were partially offset by realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts.\nComparison of the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020\nThe comparison of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 can be found within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 which is incorporated by reference herein.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe generate cash from (1) cash flows from operations, including earnings on investments, as well as interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in cash-equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, and (2) borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities.\nOur primary use of cash is for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including our expenses, the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee), (3) debt service of borrowings under our credit facilities and secured borrowings, and (4) cash distributions to the stockholders.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $4,167,222. During that period, $36,861,615 of cash was provided by operating activities, primarily consisting of cash proceeds from the sales and repayments of investments, a net increase in net payables from unsettled transactions and cash provided by net investment income, partially offset by cash used to fund new investments. During the same period, cash used in financing activities was $40,685,790, primarily consisting of distributions to stockholders of $36,716,365 and $9,969,425 of net repayment of secured borrowings, partially offset by $6,000,000 of net borrowings under our credit facilities.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $7,443,071. During that period, $124,961,666 of cash was used in operating activities, primarily consisting of cash used to fund new investments, partially offset by cash proceeds from the sales and repayments of investments. During the same period, cash provided by financing activities was $117,925,820, primarily consisting of $146,000,000 of net borrowings under our credit facilities and $9,969,425 of net proceeds from secured borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders of $37,238,403 and financings costs paid of $805,202.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $19,405,793 of cash and cash equivalents (including $3,794,868 of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $559,313,056, $7,586,938 of interest receivable, $5,242,361 of due from portfolio companies, $257,000,000 of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and $8,853,364 of net payables from unsettled transactions.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had $23,573,015 of cash and cash equivalents (including $4,317,968 of restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $575,429,432, $3,196,194 of interest receivable, $251,000,000 of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $9,969,425 of secured borrowings and $11,349,581 of receivables from unsettled transactions.\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of $22,812,917 and $48,497,448, respectively, of unfunded commitments to provide debt and equity financing to certain of our portfolio companies. Such commitments are subject to the portfolio company's satisfaction of certain financial and nonfinancial covenants and may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have analyzed cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facilities, the ability to rotate out of certain assets and amounts of unfunded commitments that could be drawn and believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities in the current economic climate.\nContractual Obligations\nDebt Outstanding\nas of September 30, 2021 Debt Outstanding\nas of September 30, 2022 Weighted average debt\noutstanding for the\nyear ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 Maximum debt\noutstanding for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCitibank Facility $ 200,000,000 $ 220,000,000 $ 221,265,753 $ 231,000,000\nCNB-2 Facility 51,000,000 37,000,000 34,767,123 51,000,000\nSecured Borrowings 9,969,425 - 7,999,097 13,000,786\nTotal debt $ 260,969,425 $ 257,000,000 $ 264,031,973\nPayments due by period as of September 30, 2022\nTotal < 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years\nCNB-2 Facility $ 37,000,000 $ 37,000,000 $ - $ -\nInterest due on CNB-2 Facility 1,294,058 1,294,058 - -\nCitibank Facility 220,000,000 - 220,000,000 -\nInterest due on Citibank Facility 27,068,004 11,637,010 15,430,994 -\nTotal $ 285,362,062 $ 49,931,068 $ 235,430,994 $ -\nEquity Activity\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we completed drawdowns of $337,558,996, or 100%, of Capital Commitments from investors in connection with Private Offerings, of which $3,854,346 in Capital Commitments were made by one or more affiliates of the Adviser.\nWe have the authority under our organizational documents to issue 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 per share par value and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 per share par value.

In connection with these defaults, Capital Commitments and proceeds from capital drawdowns were each reduced by $125,000.\nLeverage\nOn July 9, 2018, our sole stockholder approved our becoming subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150% as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act. As a result of this approval, we are permitted to borrow amounts so long as our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). As of September 30, 2022, our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, was 225.3%, and senior securities outstanding were $257.0 million.\nWe may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow additional money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as \"senior securities,\" up to the maximum amount permitted by the Investment Company Act. We have securitized and may in the future securitize a portion of our investments to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation. To securitize investments, we typically create a wholly-owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We then typically sell interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary. Our primary uses of funds are investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock.\nCNB-1 Facility\nOn October 16, 2018, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the CNB-1 Loan Agreement) between us, as borrower, and City National Bank (\"CNB\"), as lender. Prior to its termination, the CNB-1 Loan Agreement provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"CNB-1 Facility\"), of up to $60 million (the \"CNB-1 Facility Maximum Commitment\"), in aggregate principal amount, subject to the lesser of (i) a percentage of unfunded commitments from certain classes of eligible investors in the Company and (ii) the CNB-1 Facility Maximum Commitment and had a scheduled maturity date of October 15, 2020. On May 1, 2020, we repaid all borrowings outstanding under the CNB-1 Facility, following which the CNB-1 Facility was terminated.\nBorrowings under the CNB-1 Facility bore interest at a rate equal to (a) the LIBOR for the selected period plus 1.65% for LIBOR loans or (b) the prime rate of CNB minus 0.25% for prime rate loans. There was a non-usage fee of 25 basis points per year on the unused portion of the CNB-1 Facility, payable quarterly.\nThe CNB-1 Facility was secured by a first priority security interest, subject to customary exceptions, in (i) all Capital Commitments, (ii) our right to make capital calls, receive payment of capital contributions from investors and enforce payment of capital commitments and capital contributions under our Subscription Agreements with investors and other operative documents and (iii) a cash collateral account into which the capital contributions from investors are made. We made customary representations and warranties and were required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting\nrequirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Our borrowings, including under the CNB-1 Facility, were subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the CNB-1 Facility. Our borrowings under the CNB-1 Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.27% for the year ended September 30, 2020. For the year ended September 30, 2020, we recorded interest expense (inclusive of fees) of $1,769,383 related to the CNB-1 Facility.\nCNB-2 Facility\nOn June 9, 2020 (the CNB-2 Closing Date), we entered into a loan and security agreement, which was subsequently amended on March 31, 2021 (as amended, the CNB-2 Loan Agreement) between us, as borrower, and CNB, as lender. The CNB-2 Loan Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the CNB-2 Facility) of up to $60 million (the CNB-2 Facility Maximum Commitment) in aggregate principal amount, subject to the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, which is an amount determined by applying different rates to eligible assets held by the Company based generally on the value of such assets and (ii) the CNB-2 Facility Maximum Commitment. The maturity date of the CNB-2 Facility is June 9, 2023.\nBorrowings under the CNB-2 Facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for the selected period (subject to a floor of 0.25%) plus 2.50%. There is a non-usage fee of 50 basis points per year on the unused portion of the CNB-2 Facility, payable annually, if on any anniversary of the CNB-2 Closing Date, the average daily utilization of the CNB-2 Facility is less than $25 million over the prior 365-day period.\nThe CNB-2 Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including our portfolio investments but excluding those investments held in OSI 2 SPV (defined below). We have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. Our borrowings, including under the CNB-2 Facility, are subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had $37.0 million and $51.0 million, respectively, outstanding under the CNB-2 Facility. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our borrowings under the CNB-2 Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.37%, 2.91% and 3.32%, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded interest expense (inclusive of fees) of $1,423,297, $1,302,400 and $183,244, respectively, related to the CNB-2 Facility.\nCitibank Facility\nOn July 26, 2019 (the \"Citibank Closing Date\"), we and OSI 2 Senior Lending SPV, LLC (\"OSI 2 SPV\"), a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of us, entered into a loan and security agreement, which was subsequently amended on September 20, 2019, July 2, 2020, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021 (as amended, the \"Citibank Loan Agreement\"), with the lenders from time to time party thereto and the other parties referenced below. Under the terms of the Citibank Loan Agreement, we serve as the collateral manager and seller and OSI 2 SPV serves as borrower with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent.\nThe Citibank Loan Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Citibank Facility\"), of up to $250 million (the \"Citibank Maximum Commitment\"), in aggregate principal amount, subject to the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, which is an amount based on advance rates that vary depending on the class of assets and the value assigned to such assets under the Citibank Loan Agreement and (ii) the Citibank Maximum Commitment. The Citibank Facility has a forty-two (42) month reinvestment period (the \"Reinvestment Period\"), during which advances may be made; and matures sixty-six (66) months from the Citibank Closing Date. Following the Reinvestment Period, OSI 2 SPV will be required to make certain mandatory amortization payments. Borrowings under the Citibank Facility bear interest payable quarterly at a rate per year equal to (a) in the case of a lender that is identified as a conduit lender under the Loan Agreement, the lesser of (i) the applicable commercial paper rate for such conduit lender and (ii) the LIBOR for a three month maturity and (b) for all other lenders under the Citibank Facility, LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable spread. During the Reinvestment Period, the applicable spread is the greater of (i) a weighted average rate of (x) 1.65% per year for broadly syndicated loans and (y) 2.25% per year for all other eligible loans and (ii) 1.85%. After the Reinvestment Period, the applicable spread is 3.00% per year. There is also a non-usage fee of (i) 0.40% per year for the first six months following the Citibank Closing Date (the \"Ramp-Up Period\"), and (ii) 0.50% per year thereafter, in each case, on the unused portion of the Citibank Facility, payable quarterly; provided that if after the Ramp-Up Period the unused portion of the Citibank Facility is greater than 30% of the commitments under the Citibank Facility, the non-usage fee will be based on an unused portion of 30% of the commitments under the Citibank Facility.\nThe Citibank Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of OSI 2 SPVs assets.\nAs part of the Citibank Facility, OSI 2 SPV is subject to certain limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used and the types of loans that are eligible to be acquired by OSI 2 SPV including, but not limited to, restrictions on sector concentrations, loan size, tenor and minimum investment ratings (or estimated ratings). The Citibank Facility also contains certain requirements relating to interest coverage, collateral quality and portfolio performance, certain violations of which could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the Citibank Facility.\nUnder the Citibank Facility, we and OSI 2 SPV, as applicable, have made customary representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities.\nOSI 2 SPVs borrowings are non-recourse to us but are considered borrowings of us for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the Investment Company Act.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had $220.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, outstanding under the Citibank Facility. Our borrowings under the Citibank Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.00%, 2.32% and 2.91%, for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded interest expense (inclusive of fees) of $7,300,813, $3,999,650 and $2,692,069, respectively, related to the Citibank Facility.\nSecured Borrowings\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had no secured borrowings outstanding. As of September 30, 2021, we had $10.0 million\nof secured borrowings outstanding, which were recorded as a result of certain securities that were sold and simultaneously\nrepurchased at a premium, with amounts payable to the counterparty due on the repurchase settlement date, which is generally\nwithin 120 days of the trade date. Our secured borrowings bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.43% and 3.23%, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. We recorded $274,617 and $194,922 of interest expense in connection with secured borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRegulated Investment Company Status and Distributions\nWe anticipate that we will make quarterly distributions of at least 90% of our realized net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, if any, then available for distribution, each as determined by our board of directors in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Governing Documents. Any distributions will be declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We expect quarterly distributions to be paid from income primarily generated by interest earned on our investments, although distributions to stockholders may also include a return of capital.\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain RIC qualification, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each tax year, at least 90% of our investment company taxable income for that year. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we intend to distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year; (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and, (3) any undistributed ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax less certain over-distributions in prior years. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses), if any, at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment, pay U.S. federal income tax on such amounts at regular corporate tax rates, and elect to treat such gains as deemed distributions to stockholders. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, to the extent that we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the Investment Company Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.\nDepending on the level of taxable income and net capital gain earned in a year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income or net capital gain for distribution in the following year and pay the applicable U.S. federal excise tax. Distributions will be appropriately adjusted for any taxes payable by us or any direct or indirect subsidiary through which it invests (including any corporate, state, local, non-U.S. and withholding taxes). Any Incentive Fee to be paid to our Adviser will not be reduced to take into account any such taxes.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. The following table, which may be subject to change as we finalize our annual tax filings, lists the percentage of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains for the year ended September 30, 2022, our most recently completed tax year end.\nYear Ended Qualified Net Interest Income Qualified Short-Term Capital Gains\nSeptember 30, 2022 68.3 % 16.5 %\nThe following table reflects the distributions per share that we have paid on our common stock during the year ended September 30, 2022:\nDistribution Type Record Date Payment Date Amount\nper Share Cash Distribution\nQuarterly December 15, 2021 December 28, 2021 $ 0.42 $ 7,308,472\nSpecial December 15, 2021 December 28, 2021 0.38 6,612,424\nQuarterly March 15, 2022 March 28, 2022 0.43 7,482,481\nQuarterly June 15, 2022 June 30, 2022 0.44 7,656,494\nQuarterly September 15, 2022 September 27, 2022 0.44 7,656,494\n$ 2.11 $ 36,716,365\nThe following table reflects the distributions per share that the Company has paid on its common stock during the year ended September 30, 2021:\nDistribution Type Record Date Payment Date Amount\nper Share Cash Distribution\nQuarterly December 15, 2020 December 31, 2020 $ 0.35 $ 6,090,393\nSpecial December 15, 2020 December 31, 2020 0.62 10,788,696\nQuarterly March 15, 2021 March 26, 2021 0.35 6,090,393\nQuarterly June 15, 2021 June 30, 2021 0.40 6,960,449\nQuarterly September 15, 2021 September 27, 2021 0.42 7,308,472\n$ 2.14 $ 37,238,403\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, an affiliate of the Adviser. The Adviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC.\nRecent Developments\nDistribution Declaration\nOn December 12, 2022, our board of directors approved a quarterly distribution of $0.44 per share, payable in cash on December 27, 2022 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2022. Additionally, on December 12, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a special distribution of $0.23 per share, payable in cash on December 27, 2022 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2022.\nMerger Agreement\nOn September 14, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement, which provides that, subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with us continuing as the surviving company and as OCSLs wholly-owned subsidiary and, immediately thereafter, we will merge with and into OCSL, with OCSL continuing as the surviving company. Both our board of directors and the board of directors of OCSL, including all of the respective independent directors, in each case, on the recommendation of a special committee comprised solely of certain independent directors of us or OCSL, as applicable, have approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nAt the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of OCSL Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), plus any cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares.\nAs of a mutually agreed date no earlier than 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time, which we refer as the Determination Date, each of us and OCSL will deliver to the other a calculation of its net asset value as of such date, in each case using a pre-agreed set of assumptions, methodologies and adjustments. We refer to such calculation with respect to us as the Closing OSI2 Net Asset Value and with respect to OCSL as the Closing OCSL Net Asset Value. Based on such calculations, the parties will calculate the OSI2 Per Share NAV, which will be equal to (i) the Closing OSI2 Net Asset Value divided by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the Determination Date (excluding any Cancelled Shares), and the OCSL Per Share NAV, which will be equal to (A) the Closing OCSL Net Asset Value divided by (B) the number of shares of OCSL Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Determination Date. The Exchange Ratio will be equal to the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of (i) the OSI2 Per Share NAV divided by (ii) the OCSL Per Share NAV.\nWe and OCSL will update and redeliver the Closing OSI2 Net Asset Value or the Closing OCSL Net Asset Value, respectively, in the event of a material change to such calculation between the Determination Date and the closing of the Mergers and if needed to ensure that the calculation is determined within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by each of us, OCSL and Oaktree. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the operation of each of our and OCSLs businesses during the period prior to the closing of the Mergers.\nConsummation of the Mergers, which is currently anticipated to occur during the second fiscal quarter of 2023, is subject to certain closing conditions, including requisite approvals of our and OCSLs stockholders and certain other closing conditions.\nThe Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights in favor of us and OCSL, including if the Mergers are not completed on or before June 30, 2023 or if the requisite approvals of our or OCSLs stockholders are not obtained. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, a third party acquiring us may be required to pay OCSL a termination fee of approximately $9.8 million. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, a third party acquiring OCSL may be required to pay to us a termination fee of approximately $37.9 million.\nThe foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement (except as may be expressly set forth in the Merger Agreement); may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors and security holders should not rely on such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any of the parties to the Merger Agreement or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the parties to the Merger Agreement. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in the valuations of our investment portfolio and interest rates.\nValuation Risk\nOur investments often do not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, as the valuation designee appointed by our board of directors pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith and valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment. In addition, our valuation methodology utilizes discount rates in part in valuing our investments, and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the valuation of our investments. Accordingly, valuations by us do not necessarily represent the amounts which may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments. Estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed, and the differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments, cash and cash equivalents and idle funds investments. Our risk management procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA and prime rates, to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates.\nAs of September 30, 2022, 91.5% of our debt investment portfolio at fair value bore interest at floating rates. The composition of our floating rate debt investments by interest rate floor as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 was as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\n($ in thousands) Fair Value % of Floating\nRate Portfolio Fair Value % of Floating\nRate Portfolio\n0% $ 37,265,822 7.46 % $ 48,594,490 9.30 %\n>0% and <1% 137,622,429 27.56 97,766,063 18.72\n1% 303,106,103 60.69 355,262,700 68.02\n>1% 21,411,903 4.29 20,656,619 3.96\nTotal $ 499,406,257 100.00 % $ 522,279,872 100.00 %\nBased on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2022, the following table shows the approximate annualized net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations (excluding the impact of any potential incentive fees) of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investment and capital structure. However, there can be no assurances our portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates.\nBasis point increase Increase in Interest Income (Increase) in Interest Expense Net increase in net assets resulting from operations\n250 $ 12,865,517 $ (6,425,000) $ 6,440,517\n200 10,284,291 (5,140,000) 5,144,291\n150 7,703,065 (3,855,000) 3,848,065\n100 5,121,839 (2,570,000) 2,551,839\n50 2,542,663 (1,285,000) 1,257,663\nBasis point decrease (Decrease) in Interest Income Decrease in Interest Expense Net (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations\n50 $ (2,537,204) $ 1,285,000 $ (1,252,204)\n100 (5,017,879) 2,570,000 (2,447,879)\n150 (7,485,342) 3,855,000 (3,630,342)\n200 (9,943,513) 5,140,000 (4,803,513)\n250 (11,961,061) 6,351,000 (5,610,061)\nWe regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on this review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for primarily most of the floating rate loans is indexed to the LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. The following table shows a comparison of the interest rate base for our outstanding debt investments, at principal, and our outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nDebt Investments Borrowings Debt Investments Borrowings\nPrime rate $ 745,881 $ - $ 1,097,727 $ -\nLIBOR:\n30 day 145,886,106 37,000,000 135,281,414 51,000,000\n90 day 225,699,332 220,000,000 259,893,962 200,000,000\n180 day 53,339,994 - 79,023,702 -\n360 day - - 20,074,643 -\nEURIBOR:\n30 day 5,042,259 - 5,965,116 -\n90 day 6,681,213 - 7,904,039 -\n180 day 1,031,309 - 5,428,096 -\nSOFR\n30 day 19,329,700 - - -\n90 day 51,831,659 - - -\nSONIA 14,637,092 - - -\nUK LIBOR:\n30 day - - 4,213,594 -\n180 day - - 13,466,173 -\nFixed rate 46,961,783 - 42,102,695 9,969,425\nTotal $ 571,186,328 $ 257,000,000 $ 574,451,161 $ 260,969,425 Item 8.

(the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 by correspondence with the custodians, syndication agents and underlying investee companies, and by other appropriate auditing procedures where confirmation was not received. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nLos Angeles, CA\nDecember 14, 2022\nOaktree Strategic Income II, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nASSETS\nAssets:\nInvestments -

All equity investments are non-income producing unless otherwise noted.\n(2)See Note 3 in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for portfolio composition by geographic region.\n(3)Interest rates may be adjusted from period to period on certain term loans and revolvers. These rate adjustments may be either temporary in nature due to tier pricing arrangements or financial or payment covenant violations in the original credit agreements or permanent in nature per loan amendment or waiver documents.\n(4)Each of the Company's investments is pledged as collateral under one or more of its credit facilities. A single investment may be divided into parts that are individually pledged as collateral to separate credit facilities.\n(5)The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for most of the floating rate loans is indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. Certain loans may also be indexed to the secured overnight financing rate (\"SOFR\") or the sterling overnight index average (\"SONIA\"). The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, the Company has provided the applicable margin over the reference rates based on each respective credit agreement and the cash interest rate as of period end. All LIBOR shown above is in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. As of September 30, 2022, the reference rates for the Company's variable rate loans were the 30-day LIBOR at 3.12%, the 90-day LIBOR at 3.67%, the 180-day LIBOR at 4.17%, the PRIME at 6.25%, the 30-day SOFR at 3.03%, the 90-day SOFR at 3.55%, the SONIA at 1.69%, the 30-day EURIBOR at 0.69%, the 90-day EURIBOR at 0.99% and the 180-day EURIBOR at 0.38%. Most loans include an interest floor, which generally ranges from 0% to 1%. SOFR and SONIA based contracts may include a credit spread adjustment that is charged in addition to the base rate and the stated spread.\n(6)Principal includes accumulated payment in kind (\"PIK\") interest and is net of repayments, if any. \"\u20ac\" signifies the investment is denominated in Euros. \u00a3 signifies the investment is denominated in British Pounds. All other investments are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n(7)Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Control Investments generally are defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act\"), as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities and/or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of the company. Affiliate Investments generally are defined by the Investment Company Act as investments in companies in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities.\n(8)As of September 30, 2022, these investments are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy established by Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\"ASC 820\") and were valued using significant unobservable inputs.\n(9)Investment has undrawn commitments. Unamortized fees are classified as unearned income which reduces cost basis, which may result in a negative cost basis. A negative fair value may result from the unfunded commitment being valued below par.\n(10)Investment is not a qualifying asset as defined under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's total assets. As of September 30, 2022, qualifying assets represented 80.5% of the Company's total assets and non-qualifying assets represented 19.5% of the Company's total assets.\n(11)One half of the Seller Earn Out Shares will vest if, at any time through June 16, 2027, the Alvotech SA common share price is at or above a volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of $15.00 per share for any ten trading days within any twenty trading day period, and the other half will vest, if at any time during such period, the common share price is at or above a VWAP of $20.00 per share for any ten trading days within any twenty trading day period.\nSee notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOaktree Strategic Income II, Inc.\nConsolidated Schedule of Investments\nSeptember 30, 2021\nPortfolio Company/Type of Investment (1)(2)(3)(4) Cash Interest Rate (5) Industry Principal (6) Cost Fair Value Notes\nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\n(7)\n109 Montgomery Owner LLC Real Estate Operating Companies\nFirst Lien Delayed Draw Term Loan, LIBOR+7.00% cash due 2/2/2023 7.50 % $ 750,674 $ 725,811 $ 763,057 (5)(8)(9)\n725,811 763,057\nA.T.

All equity investments are non-income producing unless otherwise noted.\n(2)See Note 3 in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for portfolio composition by geographic region.\n(3)Interest rates may be adjusted from period to period on certain term loans and revolvers. These rate adjustments may be either temporary in nature due to tier pricing arrangements or financial or payment covenant violations in the original credit agreements or permanent in nature per loan amendment or waiver documents.\n(4)Each of the Company's investments is pledged as collateral under one or more of its credit facilities. A single investment may be divided into parts that are individually pledged as collateral to separate credit facilities.\n(5)The interest rate on the principal balance outstanding for all floating rate loans is indexed to the LIBOR and/or an alternate base rate (e.g., prime rate), which typically resets semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each of these loans, the Company has provided the applicable margin over LIBOR or the alternate base rate based on each respective credit agreement and the cash interest rate as of period end. All LIBOR shown above is in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. As of September 30, 2021, the reference rates for the Company's variable rate loans were the 30-day LIBOR at 0.08%, the 60-day LIBOR at 0.11%, the 90-day LIBOR at 0.13%, the 180-day LIBOR at 0.16%, the 360-day LIBOR at 0.24%, the PRIME at 3.25%, the 30-day UK LIBOR at 0.05%, the 180-day UK LIBOR at 0.09%, the 30-day EURIBOR at (0.57)%, the 90-day EURIBOR at (0.56)% and the 180-day EURIBOR at (0.53)%. Most loans include an interest floor, which generally ranges from 0% to 1%.\n(6)Principal includes accumulated PIK interest and is net of repayments, if any. \"\u20ac\" signifies the investment is denominated in Euros. \u00a3 signifies the investment is denominated in British Pounds. All other investments are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n(7)Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Control Investments generally are defined by the Investment Company Act, as investments in companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities and/or has the power to exercise control over the management or policies of the company. Affiliate Investments generally are defined by the Investment Company Act as investments in companies in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities.\n(8)As of September 30, 2021, these investments are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820 and were valued using significant unobservable inputs.\n(9)Investment has undrawn commitments. Unamortized fees are classified as unearned income which reduces cost basis, which may result in a negative cost basis. A negative fair value may result from the unfunded commitment being valued below par.\n(10)Investment is not a qualifying asset as defined under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company's total assets. As of September 30, 2021, qualifying assets represented 79.8% of the Company's total assets and non-qualifying assets represented 20.2% of the Company's total assets.\n(11)PIK interest income for this investment accrues at an annualized rate of 15%, however, the PIK interest is not contractually capitalized on the investment subsequent to a restructuring that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2021. As a result, the principal amount of the investment does not increase over time for accumulated PIK interest. As of September 30, 2021, the accumulated PIK interest balance for each of the Alvotech A notes and the B notes was $0.1 million. The fair value of this investment is inclusive of PIK interest income.\n(12)The sale of all or a portion of this investment did not qualify for sale accounting under ASC 860, and therefore the investment remains on the Company's Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of September 30, 2021. See \"Secured Borrowings\" in Note 6 in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for year ended September 30, 2021 for further details.\nSee notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization\nOaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, where applicable, the \"Company\") is structured as a closed-end investment company focused on lending to small- and medium-sized companies. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company (a \"BDC\") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act\") and has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the \"Code\").\nThe Company was formed on April 30, 2018 as a Delaware corporation and as of September 30, 2022 is externally managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\") pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement), between the Company and the Adviser, which was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 11, 2020. From July 9, 2018 through May 11, 2020, the Company was managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., an affiliate of the Adviser. The Adviser is a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC (\"OCG\"). In 2019, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (\"Brookfield\") acquired a majority economic interest in OCG. OCG operates as an independent business within Brookfield, with its own product offerings and investment, marketing and support teams.\nThe Company conducted private offerings (each, a Private Offering) of its common stock (\"Common Stock\") to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). At each closing of a Private Offering, each investor participating in that closing made a capital commitment (each, a Capital Commitment) to purchase the Company's Common Stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with the Company in connection with its Capital Commitment (\"Subscription Agreement\"). The initial closing of a Private Offering occurred on August 6, 2018 (the \"Initial Closing\"). The Company commenced its loan origination and investment activities shortly after its initial capital drawdown from its non-affiliated investors (the \"Initial Drawdown\"). The proceeds from the Initial Drawdown provided the Company with the necessary seed capital to commence operations. As of September 30, 2022, the Company completed drawdowns of $337,558,996, or 100%, of Capital Commitments from investors in connection with Private Offerings, of which $3,854,346 in Capital Commitments were made by one or more affiliates of the Adviser.\nThe Company seeks to invest opportunistically across asset classes and geographies, primarily in the form of senior loans, and to a lesser extent, high yield bonds, to borrowers that are in need of direct loans, rescue financings or other capital solutions or that have had challenged or unsuccessful primary offerings. The Company's investment objective is to generate current income and long-term capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve its investment objective without subjecting principal to undue risk of loss by lending to and investing in the debt of public and private companies, primarily in situations where a company or its owners are (a) overleveraged or facing pressure to recapitalize, (b) unable to access broadly syndicated capital markets, (c) undervalued after having recently exited bankruptcy, completed a restructuring or are in a cyclically out-of-favor industry or (d) otherwise affected by mispricings or inefficiencies in the capital markets or at different points throughout the credit cycle.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OCSL), Project Superior Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OCSL (Merger Sub), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Adviser. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCSL (the Merger) and, immediately thereafter, the Company will merge with and into OCSL, with OCSL continuing as the surviving company (together with the Merger, the Mergers). See Note 13. Pending Merger with OCSL for additional information regarding the terms of the proposed Mergers.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company is an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies (\"ASC 946\").\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to the Company and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the economic and political environments, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ and such differences could be material. Significant estimates include the valuation of investments and revenue recognition.\nConsolidation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Each consolidated subsidiary is wholly-owned and, as such, consolidated into the consolidated financial statements. Certain subsidiaries of the Company that hold investments are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes. The assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of the Company. As an investment company, portfolio investments held by the Company are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements but rather are included on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as investments at fair value.\nFair Value Measurements:\nThe Adviser, as the valuation designee of the Companys board of directors pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, determines the fair value of the Companys assets on at least a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity.\nHierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the Adviser's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.\nIf inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Adviser's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions.\nFinancial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, the Adviser obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers for all of the Company's investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing vendors and brokers use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.\nThe Adviser seeks to obtain at least two quotations for the subject or similar securities, typically from pricing vendors. If the Adviser is unable to obtain two quotes from pricing vendors, or if the prices obtained from pricing vendors are not within the Adviser's set threshold, the Adviser seeks to obtain a quote directly from a broker making a market for the asset. The Adviser evaluates the quotations provided by pricing vendors and brokers based on available market information, including trading activity of the subject or similar securities, or by performing a comparable security analysis to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. The Adviser also performs back-testing of valuation information obtained from pricing vendors and\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbrokers against actual prices received in transactions. In addition to ongoing monitoring and back-testing, the Adviser performs due diligence procedures over pricing vendors to understand their methodology and controls to support their use in the valuation process. Generally, the Adviser does not adjust any of the prices received from these sources.\nIf the quotations obtained from pricing vendors or brokers are determined not to be reliable or are not readily available, the Adviser values such investments using any of three different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is the transaction precedent technique, which utilizes recent or expected future transactions of the investment to determine fair value, to the extent applicable. The second valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value (\"EV\") of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The EV analysis is typically performed to determine (i) the value of equity investments, (ii) whether there is credit impairment for debt investments and (iii) the value for debt investments that the Company is deemed to control under the Investment Company Act. To estimate the EV of a portfolio company, the Adviser analyzes various factors, including the portfolio companys historical and projected financial results, macroeconomic impacts on the company and competitive dynamics in the companys industry. the Adviser also utilizes some or all of the following information based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company: (i) valuations of comparable public companies, (ii) recent sales of private and public comparable companies in similar industries or having similar business or earnings characteristics, (iii) purchase prices as a multiple of their earnings or cash flow, (iv) the portfolio companys ability to meet its forecasts and its business prospects, (v) a discounted cash flow analysis, (vi) estimated liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets and (vii) offers from third parties to buy the portfolio company. The Adviser may probability weight potential sale outcomes with respect to a portfolio company when uncertainty exists as of the valuation date. The third valuation technique is a market yield technique, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. In the market yield technique, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk, and the Adviser considers the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by the Company are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Adviser depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable.\nThe Adviser estimates the fair value of certain privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions, including the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.\nIn December 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act. Rule 2a-5 permits boards of registered investment companies and BDCs to either (i) choose to continue to determine fair value in good faith, or (ii) designate a valuation designee tasked with determining fair value in good faith, subject to the boards oversight. The Company's board of directors has designated the Adviser to serve as its valuation designee effective September 8, 2022.\nThe Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of the Company's investments:\nThe quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the Adviser's valuation team;\nPreliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of the Adviser;\nSeparately, independent valuation firms prepare valuations of the Company's investments, on a selected basis, for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment, and submit the reports to the Company and provide such reports to the Adviser;\nThe Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee;\nThe Audit Committee reviews the valuation report with the Adviser, and the Adviser responds and supplements the valuation report to reflect any discussions between the Adviser and the Audit Committee; and\nThe Adviser, as valuation designee, determines the fair value of each investment in the Company's portfolio.\nThe fair value of the Company's investments as of September 30, 2022 was determined by the Adviser, as the Company's valuation designee, and the fair value of the Company's investments as of September 30, 2021 was determined in good faith by the board of directors. The Company has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms each quarter to provide\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nassistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of its portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Companys investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.\nWith the exception of the line items entitled \"deferred financing costs,\" \"other assets,\" \"deferred tax liability,\" \"secured borrowings\" and \"credit facilities payable,\" which are reported at amortized cost, all assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying value of the line items titled \"interest receivable,\" \"receivables from unsettled transactions,\" \"accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities,\" \"base management fee and incentive fees payable,\" \"due to affiliates,\" \"interest payable\" and \"payables from unsettled transactions\" approximate fair value due to their short maturities.\nForeign Currency Translation:\nThe accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the prevailing foreign exchange rate on the reporting date. The Company does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. The Companys investments in foreign securities may involve certain risks, including foreign exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic risks, all of which could affect the market and/or credit risk of the investment. In addition, changes in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect the value of these investments and therefore the earnings of the Company.\nDerivative Instruments:\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies. In a foreign currency forward contract, the Company agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of one currency for another at a pre-determined price at a future date. Foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the applicable forward rate. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts are recorded as a \"derivative asset at fair value\" or \"derivative liability at fair value\" on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is recorded separately, if applicable. Purchases and settlements of foreign currency forward contracts having the same settlement date and counterparty are generally settled net and any realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date. The Company does not utilize hedge accounting with respect to foreign currency forward contracts and as such, the Company recognizes its foreign currency forward contracts at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses included in \"net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and net realized gains or losses included in net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSecured Borrowings:\nSecurities sold and simultaneously repurchased at a premium are reported as financing transactions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (\"ASC 860\"). Amounts payable to the counterparty are due on the repurchase settlement date and, excluding accrued interest, such amounts are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as secured borrowings. Premiums payable are separately reported as accrued interest.\nInvestment Income:\nInterest Income\nInterest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount (\"OID\"), is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company stops accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or a return of capital depending upon managements judgment. A non-accrual investment is restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and the portfolio company, in managements judgment, is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining obligations. As of each of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there were no investments on non-accrual status.\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn connection with its investment in a portfolio company, the Company sometimes receives nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the portfolio company. When the Company receives nominal cost equity, the Company allocates its cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination. Any resulting discount from recording the loan, or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount, is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.\nFor the Company's secured borrowings, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within interest income and the interest earned by the counterparty is recorded within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPIK Interest Income\nThe Company's investments in debt securities may contain PIK interest provisions. PIK interest, which generally represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company generally ceases accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if the Company does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. The Company's decision to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; the Company's assessment of the portfolio company's business development success; information obtained by the Company in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. The Company's determination to cease accruing PIK interest is generally made well before the Company's full write-down of a loan or debt security. In addition, if it is subsequently determined that the Company will not be able to collect any previously accrued PIK interest, the fair value of the loans or debt securities would be reduced by the amount of such previously accrued, but uncollectible, PIK interest. The accrual of PIK interest on the Companys debt investments increases the recorded cost bases of these investments in the consolidated financial statements including for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by the Company to the Adviser. To maintain its status as a RIC, certain income from PIK interest may be required to be distributed to the Companys stockholders, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash and may never do so.\nFee Income\nThe Adviser or its affiliates may provide financial advisory services to portfolio companies in connection with structuring a transaction and in return the Company may receive fees for capital structuring services. These fees are generally nonrecurring and are recognized by the Company upon the investment closing date. The Company may also receive additional fees in the ordinary course of business, including servicing, amendment, and prepayment fees, which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned or the services are rendered.\nThe Company has also structured exit fees across certain of its portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments. These fees are typically paid to the Company upon the earliest to occur of (i) a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, (ii) the maturity date of the loan or (iii) the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs. The receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments. These fees are included in net investment income over the life of the loan.\nDividend Income\nThe Company generally recognizes dividend income on the ex-dividend date for public securities and the record date for private equity investments. Distributions received from private equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will not record distributions from private equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when acquired. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\")\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninsurance limit. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are included on the Company's Consolidated Schedule of Investments and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 assets.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, included in restricted cash was $3,794,868 and $4,317,968, respectively, which was held at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in connection with the Company's Citibank Facility (defined in Note 6 - Borrowings). The Company was restricted in terms of access to the $3,794,868 and $4,317,968, respectively, until the occurrence of the periodic distribution dates and, in connection therewith, the Companys submission of its required periodic reporting schedules and verifications of the Companys compliance with the terms of the Citibank Facility.\nDue from Portfolio Companies:\nDue from portfolio companies consists of amounts payable to the Company from its portfolio companies, including proceeds from the sale of portfolio companies not yet received or being held in escrow and excluding those amounts attributable to interest, dividends or fees receivable. These amounts are recognized as they become payable to the Company (e.g., principal payments on the scheduled amortization payment date).\nReceivables/Payables from Unsettled Transactions:\nReceivables/payables from unsettled transactions consist of amounts receivable to or payable by the Company for transactions that have not settled at the reporting date.\nDeferred Financing Costs:\nDeferred financing costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing or amending of credit facilities. Deferred financing costs incurred in connection with credit facilities are capitalized as an asset when incurred. Deferred financing costs incurred in connection with all other debt arrangements are a direct deduction from the related debt liability when incurred. Deferred financing costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the respective debt arrangement. This amortization expense is included in interest expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Upon early termination or modification of a credit facility, all or a portion of unamortized fees related to such facility may be accelerated into interest expense.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company has elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intends to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute dividends to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. As a RIC, the Company is not subject to federal income tax on the portion of its taxable income and gains distributed currently to stockholders as a dividend. Depending on the level of taxable income earned during a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then incur a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. The Company anticipates timely distribution of its taxable income within the tax rules under Subchapter M of the Code. The Company did not incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar years 2020 and 2021 and does not expect to incur a U.S. federal excise tax for calendar year 2022.\nThe Company holds certain portfolio investments through taxable subsidiaries. The purpose of the Company's taxable subsidiaries is to permit the Company to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are \"pass through\" entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes in order to comply with the RIC tax requirements. The taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and portfolio investments held by them are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements as portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. This income tax expense, if any, would be reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company uses the liability method to account for its taxable subsidiaries' income taxes. Using this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax benefits associated with net operating loss carry forwards that it may use to\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\noffset future tax obligations. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which it expects to recover or settle those temporary differences.\nFASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are \"more-likely-than-not\" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. Management has analyzed the Company's tax positions and has concluded that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded related to uncertain tax positions taken on returns filed for open tax years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company identifies its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and California, and the Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next 12 months.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting if certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3.

However, Level 3 financial instruments typically have both unobservable or Level 3 components and observable components (i.e. components that are actively quoted and can be validated by external sources). Accordingly, the appreciation (depreciation) in the tables below includes changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.\nThe principal value of the Company's credit facilities payable approximates fair value due to its variable rates and is included in Level 3 of the hierarchy. The principal value of the secured borrowings approximates fair value due to its short-term nature and is included in Level 3 of the hierarchy.\nThe following table provides a roll-forward of the changes in fair value from September 30, 2021 to September 30, 2022, for all investments for which the Company determined fair value using unobservable (Level 3) factors:\nSenior Secured Debt Subordinated Debt Preferred Equity Common Equity & Warrants Total\nFair value as of September 30, 2021 $ 442,162,872 $ 3,888,632 $ 8,585,636 $ 2,906,215 $ 457,543,355\nPurchases 104,759,942 715,861 3,083,857 630,970 109,190,630\nSales and repayments (107,184,626) (3,809,006) -

Under the terms of the Citibank Loan Agreement, the Company serves as the collateral manager and seller and OSI 2 SPV serves as borrower with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as collateral agent.\nThe Citibank Loan Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the Citibank Facility) of up to $250 million (the Citibank Maximum Commitment) in aggregate principal amount, subject to the lesser of (i) the borrowing base, which is an amount based on advance rates that vary depending on the class of assets and the value assigned to such assets under the Citibank Loan Agreement and (ii) the Citibank Maximum Commitment. The Citibank Facility has a forty-two (42) month reinvestment period (the Reinvestment Period) during which advances may be made and matures sixty-six (66) months from the Citibank Closing Date. Following the Reinvestment Period, OSI 2 SPV will be required to make certain mandatory amortization payments. Borrowings under the Citibank Facility bear interest payable quarterly at a rate per year equal to (a) in the case of a lender that is identified as a conduit lender under the Citibank Loan Agreement, the lesser of (i) the applicable commercial paper rate for such conduit lender and (ii) the LIBOR for a three month maturity and (b) for all other lenders under the Citibank Facility, LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable spread. During the Reinvestment Period, the applicable spread is the greater of (i) a weighted average rate of (x) 1.65% per year for broadly syndicated loans and (y) 2.25% per year for all other eligible loans and (ii) 1.85%. After the Reinvestment Period, the applicable spread is 3.00% per year. There is also a non-usage fee of (i) 0.40% per year for the first six months following the Citibank Closing Date (the Ramp-Up Period) and (ii) 0.50% per year thereafter, in each case, on the unused portion of the Citibank Facility, payable quarterly; provided that if after the Ramp-Up Period the unused portion of the Citibank Facility is greater than 30% of the commitments\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nunder the Citibank Facility, the non-usage fee will be based on an unused portion of 30% of the commitments under the Citibank Facility.\nThe Citibank Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of OSI 2 SPVs assets.\nAs part of the Citibank Facility, OSI 2 SPV is subject to certain limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used and the types of loans that are eligible to be acquired by OSI 2 SPV including, but not limited to, restrictions on sector concentrations, loan size, tenor and minimum investment ratings (or estimated ratings). The Citibank Facility also contains certain requirements relating to interest coverage, collateral quality and portfolio performance, certain violations of which could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the Citibank Facility.\nUnder the Citibank Facility, the Company and OSI 2 SPV, as applicable, have made customary representations and warranties, and are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities.\nOSI 2 SPVs borrowings are non-recourse to the Company but are considered borrowings of the Company for purposes of complying with the asset coverage requirements under the Investment Company Act.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company had $220.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, outstanding under the Citibank Facility. The Companys borrowings under the Citibank Facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 3.00%, 2.32% and 2.91% for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded interest expense (inclusive of fees) of $7,300,813, $3,999,650 and $2,692,069, respectively, related to the Citibank Facility.\nSecured Borrowings\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had no secured borrowings outstanding. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $10.0 million of secured borrowings outstanding, which were recorded as a result of certain securities that were sold and simultaneously repurchased at a premium, with amounts payable to the counterparty due on the repurchase settlement date, which is generally within 120 days of the trade date. The Company's secured borrowings bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.43% and 3.23%, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company recorded $274,617 and $194,922 of interest expense in connection with secured borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPrincipal Payments\nScheduled principal payments for debt obligations as of September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nPayments due during fiscal years ended September 30,\nTotal 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 and Thereafter\nCNB-2 Facility $ 37,000,000 $ 37,000,000 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCitibank Facility 220,000,000 - - 220,000,000 - -\nTotal $ 257,000,000 $ 37,000,000 $ - $ 220,000,000 $ - $ -\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 7.

Therefore, the final taxable income may be different than the estimate.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a total provision for income tax benefit of $71,534, which was primarily comprised of a deferred income tax benefit of $76,225 that resulted from unrealized depreciation on an investment held by a wholly-owned taxable subsidiary.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021,the Company recognized a total provision for income tax expense of $126,088, which was comprised of a deferred income tax expense of $113,535 that resulted from unrealized appreciation on an investment held by a wholly-owned taxable subsidiary and a current tax expense of $12,553.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized a total provision for income tax benefit of $6,367, which was comprised of a current income tax benefit of $10,206 partially offset by a deferred income tax expense of $3,839 that resulted from unrealized appreciation on investments held by wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company's tax year end, the components of accumulated undistributed income on a tax basis were as follows:\nUndistributed ordinary income, net $ 1,570,630\nNet realized capital gains $ 2,268,092\nUnrealized losses, net $ (19,271,749)\nThe aggregate cost of investments for income tax purposes was $580,288,464 as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all investments in which there was an excess of value over cost for income tax purposes was $33,549,982. As of September 30, 2022, the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all investments in which there was an excess of cost for income tax purposes over value was $52,821,731. As of September 30, 2022, net unrealized depreciation based on the aggregate cost of investments for income tax purposes was $19,271,749.\nNote 8. Concentration of Credit Risks\nThe Company deposits its cash with financial institutions and at times such balances may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by depositing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions and monitoring their financial stability.\nNote 9. Related Party Transactions\nThe Company has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components - the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee (each as defined below).\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement Fee\nPrior to (i) the listing of the Companys Common Stock on a national securities exchange or (ii) an initial public offering of the Companys Common Stock that results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $50 million and a listing of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange (each of (i) and (ii), a Qualified Listing), if any, the Adviser is entitled to receive quarterly in arrears a management fee (the Management Fee) equal to 1.00% per annum (the Applicable Management Fee Percentage) of the Companys Gross Asset Value (as defined below); provided, that prior to a Qualified Listing, the Management Fee does not exceed 1.75% per annum of the Unleveraged Asset Value (as defined below). From and after the date of a Qualified Listing, if any, the Applicable Management Fee Percentage will increase to 1.50% per annum of the Companys Gross Asset Value.\nFor purposes of calculating the Management Fee, the Gross Asset Value is determined by the Companys board of directors (including any committee thereof). Until August 6, 2019, the Management Fee for each quarter was calculated based on the Companys average Gross Asset Value at the end of each month during such calendar quarter (prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee); provided, that the Management Fee for the Companys first calendar quarter was calculated based on the Companys Gross Asset Value at the end of such calendar quarter (prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee). Following August 6, 2019, the Management Fee for each quarter is calculated based on the Companys average Gross Asset Value at the end of such quarter and at the end of the preceding quarter (in each case, prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee); provided, that the Management Fee for the calendar quarter in which the Company consummates a Qualified Listing will be calculated based on the Companys Gross Asset Value at the end of such calendar quarter (prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee). For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, base management fees were $5,656,120, $5,277,116 and $3,689,499, respectively.\nThe term Gross Asset Value means the value of the Companys gross assets, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, including portfolio investments purchased with borrowed funds and other forms of leverage, but excluding cash and cash equivalents.\nThe term Unleveraged Asset Value means the Gross Asset Value less the Companys borrowings for investment purposes determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP (other than borrowings under the Companys investor subscription credit facility that are repaid within 180 days following incurrence).\nIncentive Fee\nThe Incentive Fee consists of two parts: the Investment Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gains Incentive Fee (each defined below).\nInvestment Income Incentive Fee\nThe Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, which means consolidated interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the Management Fee, Company expenses and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt, but excluding the Incentive Fee). The Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that has not yet been received in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 1.50% per quarter (6% annualized) (the Hurdle Rate). The Company pays the Adviser an Investment Income Incentive Fee each quarter as follows:\n(a)Hurdle Rate Return: No Investment Income Incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate;\n(b)Catch-Up: 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than a 1.875% (7.5% annualized) rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets in such calendar quarter (the\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCatch-Up), which is intended to provide the Adviser with 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the Hurdle Rate did not apply, if the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the Hurdle Rate in such calendar quarter; and\n(c)80/20 Split: 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds a 1.875% (7.5% annualized) rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets in such calendar quarter, so that once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the Catch-Up in (b) immediately above is achieved, 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter is allocated to the Adviser.\nThe foregoing calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any issuances or repurchases of Common Stock during a quarter. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Investment Income Incentive Fees were $7,723,049, $7,155,662 and $3,955,710, respectively.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee\nIn addition to the Investment Income Incentive Fee described above, the Adviser is entitled to receive a Capital Gains Incentive Fee (as defined below). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year. The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is equal to 20% of the realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Initial Closing through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fee with respect to each of the investments in the Companys portfolio, provided, that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee determined as of December 31, 2018 was calculated for a period of shorter than 12 calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the date of the Initial Closing through the end of 2018 (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, and together with the Investment Income Incentive Fee, the Incentive Fees). As of September 30, 2022, the Company paid $1,496,334 of capital gains incentive fees cumulatively under the Investment Advisory Agreement\nAlthough the Capital Gains Incentive Fee due to the Adviser is not payable until it is contractually due based on the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company accrues this component at the end of each reporting period based on the Companys realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Initial Closing through the end of each reporting period, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fee, as contractually included in the calculation of the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, plus the cumulative amount of unrealized capital appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company will accrue an incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount. If such amount is negative, then there will be no accrual for such period or an appropriate reduction in any amount previously accrued. U.S. GAAP requires that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee accrual consider cumulative unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a Capital Gains Incentive Fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company reversed previously accrued Capital Gains Incentive Fees of $1,988,557. For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company accrued Capital Gains Incentive Fees of $2,029,815 and $1,027,505, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, there was no accrued capital gains incentive fee liability. As of September 30, 2021, the total accrued capital gains incentive fee liability was $3,220,463.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company had a liability on its Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities in the amounts of $3,272,662 and $6,433,876, respectively, reflecting the unpaid portion of the Base Management Fee and Incentive Fees payable to the Adviser.\nAdministration Agreement\nThe Company entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement) with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC (the Administrator), an affiliate of the Adviser. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes the Company with office facilities (certain of which are located in buildings owned by a Brookfield affiliate), equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Companys required administrative services, which include, among other things, providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, and being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists the Company in determining and publishing the net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to the\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCompanys stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of the Companys expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others.\nPayments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount that reimburses the Administrator for its costs and expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement and providing personnel and facilities. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other party, by the vote of a majority of the Companys outstanding voting securities, or by the vote of the Companys directors or by the Administrator. In addition, our Administrator entered into a sub-administration agreement (the Sub-Administration Agreement) with State Street Bank and Trust Company (State Street), pursuant to which State Street provides certain administrative and professional services. The Company bears all of the costs and expenses of any sub-administration agreements that the Administrator enters into.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Company bears its allocable portion of the costs of the compensation, benefits, and related administrative expenses (including travel expenses) of the Companys officers who provide operational and administrative services under the Administration Agreement, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to the Company (including, in each case, employees of the Administrator or an affiliate) who assist with the preparation, coordination, and administration of the foregoing or provide other back office or middle office financial or operational services to the Company. The Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the Companys business and affairs and to acting on the Companys behalf). Our board of directors reviews the fees payable under the Administration Agreement to determine that these fees are reasonable and comparable to administrative services charged by unaffiliated third parties.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred $575,978 of expenses under the Administration Agreement, of which $462,867 was included in administrator expense and the remaining $113,111 was included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company incurred $499,710 of expenses under the Administration Agreement, of which $418,580 was included in administrator expense and the remaining $81,130 was included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company incurred $551,954 of expenses under the Administration Agreement, of which $470,898 was included in administrator expense and the remaining $81,056 was included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, $920,645 and $1,055,391, respectively, was included in Due to affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, reflecting the unpaid portion of administrative expenses and other reimbursable expenses.\nPlacement Agent Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a Placement Agent Agreement with OCM Investments, LLC (the Placement Agent), an affiliate of the Adviser, which may require investors (other than investors sourced by the Company, the Adviser, the Placement Agent or their respective affiliates) to pay a distribution fee to the Placement Agent for its services. Although the Company does not pay any fees to the Placement Agent, the Company indemnifies the Placement Agent in connection with its activities.\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 10.

Pending Merger with OCSL\nOn September 14, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement, which provides that, subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with us continuing as the surviving company and as OCSLs wholly-owned subsidiary and, immediately thereafter, we will merge with and into OCSL, with OCSL continuing as the surviving company. Both our board of directors and the board of directors of OCSL, including all of the respective independent directors, in each case, on the recommendation of a special committee comprised solely of certain independent directors of us or OCSL, as applicable, have approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nAt the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by OCSL or any of its consolidated subsidiaries (the Cancelled Shares)) will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of OCSL Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), plus any cash (without interest) in lieu of fractional shares.\nAs of a mutually agreed date no earlier than 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time, which we refer as the Determination Date, each of us and OCSL will deliver to the other a calculation of its net asset value as of such date, in each case using a pre-agreed set of assumptions, methodologies and adjustments. We refer to such calculation with respect to us as the Closing OSI2 Net Asset Value and with respect to OCSL as the Closing OCSL Net Asset Value. Based on such calculations, the parties will calculate the OSI2 Per Share NAV, which will be equal to (i) the Closing OSI2 Net Asset Value divided by (ii) the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the Determination Date\nOAKTREE STRATEGIC INCOME II, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(excluding any Cancelled Shares), and the OCSL Per Share NAV, which will be equal to (A) the Closing OCSL Net Asset Value divided by (B) the number of shares of OCSL Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Determination Date. The Exchange Ratio will be equal to the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of (i) the OSI2 Per Share NAV divided by (ii) the OCSL Per Share NAV.\nWe and OCSL will update and redeliver the Closing OSI2 Net Asset Value or the Closing OCSL Net Asset Value, respectively, in the event of a material change to such calculation between the Determination Date and the closing of the Mergers and if needed to ensure that the calculation is determined within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) prior to the Effective Time.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by each of us, OCSL and Oaktree. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the operation of each of our and OCSLs businesses during the period prior to the closing of the Mergers.\nConsummation of the Mergers, which is currently anticipated to occur during the second fiscal quarter of 2023, is subject to certain closing conditions, including requisite approvals of our and OCSLs stockholders and certain other closing conditions.\nThe Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights in favor of us and OCSL, including if the Mergers are not completed on or before June 30, 2023 or if the requisite approvals of our or OCSLs stockholders are not obtained. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, a third party acquiring us may be required to pay OCSL a termination fee of approximately $9.8 million.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in timely identifying, recording, processing, summarizing and reporting any material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and effected by such company's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company\u037e\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company\u037e and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 11. Executive Compensation\nCompensation of Executive Officers\nThe Company does not currently have any employees and does not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of Oaktree or its affiliates or by subcontractors, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Adviser, and the Administration Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Administrator. Each of our executive officers is an employee of Oaktree or its affiliates and does not receive direct compensation from us. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser. Most of the services necessary for the origination and administration of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by the Adviser or its affiliates or by subcontractors.\nCompensation of Independent Directors\nEach Independent Director receives the following amounts for serving as a director of the Company: (i) a $50,000 annual fee; and (ii) an annual fee of $5,000 for the Chair of our Audit Committee.\nThe Independent Directors review their own compensation and recommend to the Board the appropriate level of compensation. In conducting their review, the Independent Directors use such information as they deem relevant, including compensation paid to directors of other BDCs of similar size and the time and effort required of the directors in fulfilling their responsibilities to the Company. The Board then determines the compensation of the Independent Directors. This level of compensation may be adjusted from time to time.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning total compensation earned by or paid to each of the Independent Directors during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. No compensation is expected to be paid to directors who are interested directors:\nFees Earned or Paid in Cash Total Compensation from the Company Total Compensation from the Fund Complex(1)\nAllison Keller, Independent Director $ 55,000 $ 55,000 $ 107,538\nSteven Mosko, Independent Director $ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ 102,538\nDeborah Gero, Independent Director $ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ 283,468\n_____________________\n(1) Fund Complex includes the Company, OCSL and OSCF, each a company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 13, 2022, the beneficial ownership information of each director of the Company, as well as the Companys executive officers, each person known to it to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of its common stock, and the executive officers and directors as a group. Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 17,401,121 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 13, 2022.\nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities. Based upon the absence of filings with the SEC by persons reporting beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the Companys common stock, the Company believes there are no such persons.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the Company believes that each beneficial owner set forth in the table below has sole voting and investment power over the shares beneficially owned by such beneficial owner. The directors are divided into two groups - interested director and Independent Directors. The interested director is an interested person of the Company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act. The address of all executive officers and directors is c/o Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc., 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071.\nName Number of Shares of Common Stock Owned Beneficially Percentage of Company Common Stock Outstanding\nInterested Director:\nArmen Panossian - -\nIndependent Directors:\nDeborah Gero - -\nAllison Keller - -\nSteven Mosko - -\nExecutive Officers:\nChristopher McKown - -\nMathew Pendo - -\nMatthew Stewart - -\nAshley Pak - -\nAll Executive Officers and Directors as a Group (1)\n5% Holders - -\n__________\n(1) Amount only includes Section 16(a) reporting persons of the Company.\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 13, 2022, the dollar range of our equity securities that is beneficially owned by each of the current directors of the Company.\nName Dollar Range of Equity Securities Beneficially Owned (1)\nInterested Director:\nArmen Panossian None\nIndependent Director:\nDeborah Gero None\nAllison Keller None\nSteven Mosko None\n__________\n(1) Beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 16a-1(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nThe Company has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components - the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee (each as defined below).\nManagement Fee\nPrior to (i) the listing of the Companys Common Stock on a national securities exchange or (ii) an initial public offering of the Companys Common Stock that results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $50 million and a listing of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange (each of (i) and (ii), a Qualified Listing), if any, the Adviser is entitled to receive quarterly in arrears a management fee (the Management Fee) equal to 1.00% per annum (the Applicable Management Fee Percentage) of the Companys Gross Asset Value (as defined below); provided, that prior to a Qualified Listing, the Management Fee does not exceed 1.75% per annum of the Unleveraged Asset Value (as defined below). From and after the date of a Qualified Listing, if any, the Applicable Management Fee Percentage will increase to 1.50% per annum of the Companys Gross Asset Value.\nFor purposes of calculating the Management Fee, the Gross Asset Value is determined by the Companys Board (including any committee thereof). Until August 6, 2019, the Management Fee for each quarter was calculated based on the Companys average Gross Asset Value at the end of each month during such calendar quarter (prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee); provided, that the Management Fee for the Companys first calendar quarter was calculated based on the Companys Gross Asset Value at the end of such calendar quarter (prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee). Following August 6, 2019, the Management Fee for each quarter is calculated based on the Companys average Gross Asset Value at the end of such quarter and at the end of the preceding quarter (in each case, prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee); provided, that the Management Fee for the calendar quarter in which the Company consummates a Qualified Listing will be calculated based on the Companys Gross Asset Value at the end of such calendar quarter (prior to taking into account any Incentive Fee). For the year ended September 30, 2022, base management fees were $5,656,120.\nThe term Gross Asset Value means the value of the Companys gross assets, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, including portfolio investments purchased with borrowed funds and other forms of leverage, but excluding cash and cash equivalents.\nThe term Unleveraged Asset Value means the Gross Asset Value less the Companys borrowings for investment purposes determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP (other than borrowings under the Companys investor subscription credit facility that are repaid within 180 days following incurrence).\nIncentive Fee\nThe Incentive Fee consists of two parts: the Investment Income Incentive Fee and the Capital Gains Incentive Fee (each defined below).\nInvestment Income Incentive Fee\nThe Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, which means consolidated interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the Management Fee, Company expenses and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt, but excluding the Incentive Fee). The Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that has not yet been received in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 1.50% per quarter (6% annualized) (the Hurdle Rate). The Company pays the Adviser an Investment Income Incentive Fee each quarter as follows:\n(a) Hurdle Rate Return: No Investment Income Incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Hurdle Rate;\n(b) Catch-Up: 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than a 1.875% (7.5% annualized) rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets in such calendar quarter (the Catch-Up), which is intended to provide the Adviser with 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the Hurdle Rate did not apply, if the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the Hurdle Rate in such calendar quarter; and\n(c) 80/20 Split: 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds a 1.875% (7.5% annualized) rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets in such calendar quarter, so that once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the Catch-Up in (a) immediately above is achieved, 20% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter is allocated to the Adviser.\nThe foregoing calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any issuances or repurchases of Common Stock during a quarter. For the year ended September 30, 2022, Investment Income Incentive Fees were $7,723,049.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee\nIn addition to the Investment Income Incentive Fee described above, the Adviser is entitled to receive a Capital Gains Incentive Fee (as defined below). The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year. The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is equal to 20% of the realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Initial Closing through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fee with respect to each of the investments in the Companys portfolio, provided, that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee determined as of December 31, 2018 was calculated for a period of shorter than 12 calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the date of the Initial Closing through the end of 2018 (the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, and together with the Investment Income Incentive Fee, the Incentive Fees). As of September 30, 2022, the Company paid $1,496,334 of capital gains incentive fees cumulatively under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nAlthough the Capital Gains Incentive Fee due to the Adviser is not payable until it is contractually due based on the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company accrues this component at the end of each reporting period based on the Companys realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Initial Closing through the end of each reporting period, computed net of all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fee, as contractually included in the calculation of the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, plus the cumulative amount of unrealized capital appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company will accrue an incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount. If such amount is negative, then there will be no accrual for such period or an appropriate reduction in any amount previously accrued. U.S. GAAP requires that the Capital Gains Incentive Fee accrual consider cumulative unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a Capital Gains Incentive Fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company reversed\npreviously accrued Capital Gains Incentive Fees of $1,988,557. As of September 30, 2022, there was no accrued capital gains incentive fee liability.\nAdministration Agreement\nThe Company is externally administered pursuant to the Administration Agreement. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes the Company with office facilities (certain of which are located in buildings owned by a Brookfield affiliate), equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Companys required administrative services, which include, among other things, providing assistance in accounting, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, and being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists the Company in determining and publishing the net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to the Companys stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of the Companys expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others.\nPayments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount that reimburses the Administrator for its costs and expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement and providing personnel and facilities. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other party, by the vote of a majority of the Companys outstanding voting securities, or by the vote of the Companys directors or by the Administrator. In addition, our Administrator entered into the Sub-Administration Agreement with State Street, pursuant to which State Street provides certain administrative and professional services. The Company bears all of the costs and expenses of any sub-administration agreements that the Administrator enters into.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Company bears its allocable portion of the costs of the compensation, benefits, and related administrative expenses (including travel expenses) of the Companys officers who provide operational and administrative services under the Administration Agreement, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to the Company (including, in each case, employees of the Administrator or an affiliate) who assist with the preparation, coordination, and administration of the foregoing or provide other back office or middle office financial or operational services to the Company. The Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the Companys business and affairs and to acting on the Companys behalf). Our board of directors reviews the fees payable under the Administration Agreement to determine that these fees are reasonable and comparable to administrative services charged by unaffiliated third parties.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred $575,978 of expenses under the Administration Agreement.\nPlacement Agent Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a Placement Agent Agreement with the Placement Agent, which may require investors (other than investors sourced by the Company, the Adviser, the Placement Agent or their respective affiliates) to pay a distribution fee to the Placement Agent for its services. Although the Company does not pay any fees to the Placement Agent, the Company indemnifies the Placement Agent in connection with its activities.\nCo-Investment Relief\nThe Adviser has received exemptive relief from the SEC to allow certain managed funds and accounts, each of whose investment adviser is the Adviser or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, as well as certain Oaktree proprietary accounts, to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions where doing so is consistent with the applicable registered funds or BDCs investment objective and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the SEC order.\nReview, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons\nThe Independent Directors of the Company are required to review, approve or ratify any transactions with related persons (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S K).\nDirector Independence\nFor information regarding the independence of our directors, see Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance in Part III, Item 10 of this Form 10-K.
