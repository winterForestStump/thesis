    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K (10-K or Report) for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (fiscal 2023), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as Starbucks, the Company, we, us or our.\nStarbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 86 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporations common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the symbol SBUX. We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 S.A. (Nestl\u00e9). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee\u00ae brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana\u00ae, Ethos\u00ae, Starbucks Reserve\u00ae and Princi\u00ae.\nOur primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous investments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats.\nStarbucks has always been a different kind of company - one deep with purpose, where we work together to create a positive impact in the world. With coffee at our core, we pursue ambitious goals for our partners (employees), our communities and our planet, which we believe also contributes to the long-term sustainability of our business to create a thriving business powered by thriving people for a thriving planet and communities. Our work to uplift one another extends well beyond our partners to the communities where we do business around the world. We are committed to responsible and ethical sourcing led by Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices (C.A.F.E. Practices), the Companys third-party verification program and the cornerstone of our approach to ethical sourcing of coffee with over 98% of our coffee having been historically verified through C.A.F.E. Practices as ethically sourced.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe invest in the well-being - the mental, physical and financial health - of every partner through our practices, policies and benefits. This work is grounded in the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive, supportive and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect and kindness. And we are hard at work uplifting our communities and building environments in our stores that are welcoming and safe. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus:\nOversight and Management\nWe recognize the diversity of customers, partners and communities and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management and professional development. Our Board of Directors (the Board) and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity programs and initiatives. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks cfo and general counsel, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. Furthermore, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with management, annually evaluates the effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include partner-related issues. These reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain and develop a skilled workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.\nWe regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our partners on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and\nrecommendations on how we can remain an employer of choice. The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to creating a welcoming, supportive and inclusive environment. We are committed to advancing inclusion and racial and social equity, and we seek to further that work with intention, transparency and accountability. We continue to welcome our partners, customers, civil rights and community leaders, along with our senior vice president, talent and inclusion, to advise us along this journey.\nStarbucks has made specific equity commitments based on our principles of being intentional, transparent and accountable at all levels:\nBeing intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion, with a focus on partner retention and development.\n\u25e6Expanding our mentorship program designed to prioritize our partners sense of belonging by creating an inclusive and supportive environment. Mentors offer guidance, encouragement and a safe space for partners to share their experiences, challenges and aspirations. As of 2023, the program has welcomed nearly 1,400 partners and was expanded to include U.S. based store and district managers in 2023.\nBeing transparent in our approach to Inclusion and Diversity goal setting and progress.\n\u25e6Publicly sharing workforce diversity data.\n\u25e6Setting aspirational Inclusion and Diversity goals based on retention rates and progress towards achieving racial and ethnic diversity. Our goal is to achieve racial and ethnic diversity of at least 30% of all corporate roles and at least 40% of all retail and manufacturing roles in the U.S. by 2025, by setting broad recruiting parameters and through inclusive and legally compliant employment practices.\nHolding ourselves accountable at the highest levels of the organization.\n\u25e6Incorporating our efforts to build and retain inclusive and diverse teams into our executive compensation programs.\n\u25e6Joining the Board Diversity Action Alliance to act alongside other companies similarly committed to increasing diverse representation on corporate boards.\n\u25e6Publicizing self-identified race/ethnicity/gender of each member of our Board.\nTotal Rewards\nWe have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business environment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the customer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. In the U.S., our largest and most mature market, these include:\nComprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n100% upfront tuition coverage through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan for partners to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online at Arizona State University is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\nOur Future Roast 401(k) savings plan helps partners save for their financial goal through convenient payroll deductions. Partners can contribute pre-tax or Roth after-tax dollars, and Starbucks matches 5% of eligible contributions with immediate vesting in those matching contributions.\n100% paid parental leave is available to new parents that welcome a child through birth, adoption or foster placement and work an average of 20 hours or more each week.\nA Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves or family members in need of care.\nWe view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and provide a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits. These include a free subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided meditation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually with Lyra.\nOutside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and in China, an extra 14th Month Pay initiative, giving retail partners an additional months salary as a bonus on top of the 13th month pay that is customary in China, as well as a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, and comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners.\nRole-based Support\nTo help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination.\nPay Equity\nTo be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners.\nWe previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar work. We have made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles which provide equal footing, transparency and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity.\nAs of October 1, 2023, Starbucks employed approximately 381,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 228,000 people, with approximately 219,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 153,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 148,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. Approximately 3.6% of Starbucks partners in U.S. company-operated stores are represented by unions. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by improved retention, lower turnover, and employee satisfaction during fiscal 2023.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nName Age Position\nLaxman Narasimhan 56 chief executive officer\nMichael Conway 57 group president, International and Channel Development\nSara Kelly\n44 executive vice president and chief partner officer\nBrad Lerman 67 executive vice president and general counsel\nRachel Ruggeri 54 executive vice president and chief financial officer\nLaxman Narasimhan joined Starbucks as its chief executive officer-elect in 2022 and has served as chief executive officer and has been a Starbucks director since March 2023.

Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2023 were as follows: North America (74%), International (21%) and Channel Development (5%).\nOur North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations.\nOur Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino\u00ae and Starbucks Doubleshot\u00ae, foodservice products and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, Nestl\u00e9 and others.\nRevenue Components\nWe generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores.\nCompany-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of October 1, 2023:\nNorth America As a % of\nTotal\nNorth America Stores International As a % of\nTotal\nInternational Stores Total As a % of\nTotal\nStores\nCompany-operated stores 10,628 60 % 8,964 44 % 19,592 52 %\nLicensed stores 7,182 40 % 11,264 56 % 18,446 48 %\nTotal 17,810 100 % 20,228 100 % 38,038 100 %\nThe mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region.\nCompany-operated Stores\nRevenue from company-operated stores accounted for 82% of total net revenues during fiscal 2023. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience. The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service, convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe, clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty.\nOur strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and the local business environment.\nCompany-operated store data for the fiscal year-ended October 1, 2023:\nStores Open\nas of\nStores Open\nas of\nOct 2, 2022 Opened Closed Transfers Net Oct 1, 2023\nNorth America:\nU.S. 9,265 483 (103) - 380 9,645\nCanada 946 43 (12) - 31 977\nSiren Retail 5 1 - - 1 6\nTotal North America 10,216 527 (115) - 412 10,628\nInternational:\nChina 6,019 857 (72) - 785 6,804\nJapan 1,630 110 (8) 1 103 1,733\nU.K. 318 42 (5) - 37 355\nAll Other 65 3 (1) - 2 67\nSiren Retail 5 - - - - 5\nTotal International 8,037 1,012 (86) 1 927 8,964\nTotal company-operated 18,253 1,539 (201) 1 1,339 19,592\nStarbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas.\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the Reinvention Plan). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have\nincreased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers. In our major international markets, we also continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience. Additionally, as our business has evolved, we have built an omni-channel business to meet more occasions as we serve a more diverse customer base through growth in online, e-commerce, delivery, mobile ordering and the in-store experience. In China, we leverage platforms such as Starbucks NowTM stores to enable a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. Orders may be placed in advance through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks DeliversTM and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery providers in these express retail format locations. These strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless pick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion. Our investments in a digital third place offer members access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences, giving our customers new ways to experience and connect with Starbucks. We believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth.\nRetail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores:\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 3,\nBeverages 74 % 74 % 74 %\nFood 22 % 22 % 21 %\nOther(1)\n4 % 4 % 5 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\n(1)Other primarily consists of sales of serveware, packaged and single-serve coffees and teas and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items.\nStored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks\u00ae Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our other markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks\u00ae Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (Stars) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program.\nLicensed Stores\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 13% of total net revenues in fiscal 2023. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.\nLicensed store data for the fiscal year-ended October 1, 2023:\nStores Open\nas of\nStores Open\nas of\nOct 2, 2022 Opened Closed Transfers Net Oct 1, 2023\nNorth America:\nU.S. 6,608 206 (113) - 93 6,701\nCanada 471 17 (7) - 10 481\nTotal North America 7,079 223 (120) - 103 7,182\nInternational:\nKorea 1,750 153 (33) - 120 1,870\nLatin America 1,549 108 (8) - 100 1,649\nU.K. 838 77 (4) - 73 911\nTurkey 604 81 (9) - 72 676\nTaiwan 544 30 (11) - 19 563\nIndonesia 523 58 - - 58 581\nThailand 446 29 (1) - 28 474\nPhilippines 418 29 - - 29 447\nAll Other 3,707 469 (82) (1) 386 4,093\nTotal International 10,379 1,034 (148) (1) 885 11,264\nTotal licensed 17,458 1,257 (268) (1) 988 18,446\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestl\u00e9 under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships.\nProduct Supply\nStarbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestl\u00e9 controls distribution of Starbucks packaged coffee products outside of Starbucks stores through the Global Coffee Alliance, and in some cases, also roasts and packages these products. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single-origin coffees.\nThe price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the C coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.\nWe buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge C price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2024.\nWe depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\nCompetition\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\nTrademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve and Frappuccino are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately five years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including Starbucks.com, Starbucks.net and Starbucksreserve.com.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nAvailable Information\nStarbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K reports, along with all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.starbucks.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We also use our website as a tool to disclose important information about the company and comply with our disclosure obligations under Regulation Fair Disclosure. Our corporate governance policies, code of ethics and Board committee charters and policies are also posted on the Investor Relations section of Starbucks website. The information on our website (or any webpages referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) is not part of this or any other report Starbucks files with, or furnishes to, the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section, the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. It is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on Starbucks business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\nRisks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.\nErosion of trust in our brand value can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating both from us or our business partners, or from external events. Such incidents can potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Incidents that can erode trust in our brand value include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, safety-related incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal, inequitable or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees, including our responses to unionization efforts, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Furthermore, if we are not effective in making sufficient progress toward our social and environmental program goals or in executing on our Reinvention Plan, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished.\nThe ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on making sufficient progress toward our social and environmental program goals as well as the successful execution of the Reinvention Plan, each of which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental\nand nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments or set goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. Some third parties may object to the scope or nature of our social and environmental program initiatives or goals, or any revisions to these initiatives or goals, which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) that could adversely affect our brand value.\nWe may not be successful in our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies.\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional and advertising environment. Competition to attract and retain high-quality marketing partners and endorsers has increased. Our decisions to collaborate or to cease collaborating with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our marketing, promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to reach consumers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them. If the advertising, promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease.\nFinally, consumers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations, as well as the alignment of Starbucks actions with its stated mission, values and promises. An inability to meet consumer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.\nOur global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints or solvency, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance, labor shortages and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices.\nWe also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served by foodservice operators we have authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results.\nIncidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.\nInstances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), temporary store closures, or other adverse consequences. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error.\nWe also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. The product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products. There is greater risk from those we do not monitor, or do not monitor as closely. Furthermore, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. Potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives, which include our Reinvention Plan, are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:\nbeing an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;\nbuilding our leadership position around coffee;\ndriving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally;\nsimplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers;\nincreasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the accelerated development of alternative store formats (such as Starbucks Pickup stores, Starbucks Now stores and curbside pickup);\nadjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changing economic conditions, increased global interest rates and inflation;\nmoving to a more licensed store model in certain markets and a more company-operated model in other markets;\ncreating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;\ncontinuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestl\u00e9 and other Channel Development business partners;\ndelivering continued growth in our cold beverage business;\nworking to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business; and\nreducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following:\nimposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees;\nconstruction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally;\ngovernmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores, including due to public health emergencies;\nnot successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings;\nnot successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change;\nthe deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives; and\ngeopolitical instability and international conflicts.\nEffectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, policies and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\nEvolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as a reduction in discretionary spending as a result of the resumption of student loan payments); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Our financial results have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets, inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates, disruptions to our supply chain, changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Such changes could affect consumer behavior and their ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the persisting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the disruption of customer routines, changes to employer work-from-home policies and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our North America operating segment.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on our North America operating segment, which comprised approximately 74% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal year 2023. If the North America operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the North America segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.\nOur future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units (MBUs), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.\nThe International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is expected to be our fastest growing market in terms of percentage growth, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following:\nthe effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism;\nescalating U.S.-China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China;\nthe lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in China;\nentry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China;\nchanges in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation, discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs;\nongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability and responses to climate change, which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs;\ndata-privacy and cybersecurity risks unique to the conduct of business in China; and\nfood-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety.\nAdditionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations.\nWe face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in 86 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;\nchanges or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets;\ninterpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;\nrestrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;\nimport or other business licensing requirements;\nthe enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\nlimitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations;\nin developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;\ndifficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high-quality employees in local markets;\nlocal laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;\nlocal regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols affecting our operations; and\ndelays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share.\nMoreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl\u00e9, which has the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl\u00e9 fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses.\nThere are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets.\nRisks Related to Supply Chain\nIncreases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the C price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the C coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base C coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\nThe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur in the future, they would have similar consequences on coffee price volatility. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance.\nWe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in the processing of plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nInterruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.\nAny material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high-quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are also largely outside our control.\nOur operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:\nincreases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;\ninflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates;\ndisruptions to our supply chain;\nchanges in governmental rules and approaches to taxation;\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\nadverse outcomes of litigation;\nsevere weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets;\nchanges in climate, including changes to the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services, energy and other materials throughout our supply chain; and\nespecially in our largest markets, including the U.S. and China, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social unrest and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could also adversely affect our suppliers and licensees, who in turn could experience cash flow problems, more costly or unavailable financing, credit defaults and other financial hardships. This could\u202flead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees.\u202fFurther, if any of our licensees becomes insolvent this could result in our exit from a particular market, and negatively impact our reputation.\u202fFor example, one of our licensees is experiencing financial solvency issues,\u202fwhich\u202fmay require the Company to expend capital resources to help fund\u202ftheir\u202foperating expenses in the short term.\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAs a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions. A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, changes in prevailing interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy, a global health pandemic, international trade disputes or geopolitical instability. We may also experience a reduction and increased volatility in demand for our products in connection with a global health pandemic. For example, in China, reductions and continuing volatility in that market may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores operations, impacts\ncaused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations and changes in consumer spending behaviors, including those caused by social distancing, a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or enduring changes in behavior that precipitate a more general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nFailure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nChanges in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased healthcare and workers compensation insurance costs; and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\nStarting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the authorities. Unions have secured representation rights at a number of these stores, with potentially more to follow.\nThe law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because in certain circumstances the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours or other terms and conditions of employment. These limitations could negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, and decrease our flexibility. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs.\nMoreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales, and our costs.\nAdditionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm.\nThe loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel or effectively managing changes in our workforce could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel and employees. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees upon whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our\nability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote or hybrid work arrangements. Our ability to attract and retain corporate, retail and other personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\nThe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks\u00ae stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Social and Governance Matters\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability, which factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In particular, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 86 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers and impact our customers, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or\nmeeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SECs proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we could be criticized by ESG detractors for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We could also be subjected to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks that could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of our brand and our business.\nOur brand names, trademarks and related intellectual property rights are critical assets, and our success depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences, reputational harm and civil or criminal penalties.\nComplex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.\nFor example, Europes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. In China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), has established\u202fpersonal information processing rules, data subject rights, and obligations for personal information processors, among other things. In addition to the PIPL, Chinas Data Security Law, regulates data processing activities associated with personal and non-personal data. Noncompliance with these laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Other newly enacted and proposed privacy and data protection laws in other jurisdictions served by Starbucks and its licensees may impose similar requirements, including\nrestrictions on cross-border data transfers. Such laws may impact Starbucks business operations and increase the cost and expense of compliance.\nIn the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and allows such consumers new abilities such as the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective in January 2023, significantly modified the CCPA and includes additional compliance obligations. Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia recently enacted similar data privacy legislation that has also gone into effect in 2023, and a new privacy law in Utah will go into effect at the end of 2023. In addition, a number of other states have passed or are considering additional privacy laws that are expected to take effect in the near future. These laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to comply.\nPrivacy and data protection laws such as those referenced above may impact Starbucks operation and new business models, such as Starbucks Digital Solutions, which rely on Starbucks functioning as controller of customer personal information in licensed markets. As such, Starbucks may be primarily responsible for compliance with privacy and data protection laws in the markets served by participating licensees.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines and damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all types of claims that may arise.\nThe unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.\nMany of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, business partners and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs, and confidential information about third parties, such as licensees and business partners. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems and databases. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Our third-party providers and business partners information technology systems and databases are likewise subject to such risks. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations. In addition, we provide some customer and employee data, as well as Starbucks proprietary information and other confidential information important to our business, to third parties to conduct our business, including licensees and business partners. Individuals performing work for Starbucks and such third parties also may access some of this data, including on personally-owned digital devices. To the extent we, a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers or employees data or confidential information of the Company stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of business partners and licensees and the disruption to our supply chain, business and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, vulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system misconfigurations, phishing or social engineering. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or sufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches.\nSuch security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws or trigger data breach notification laws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or licensee or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. These risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems.\nSignificant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, trainings, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\nMedia or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nWe rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, including providing Starbucks Digital Solutions to participating licensees, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Many of our non-store employees continue to work on a remote or hybrid basis, which has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, we continue to expand convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Our contractual and operational safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, climate change-related impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners or service providers systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems and related customer support could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\nRisks Related to Pandemics or Epidemics\nFuture health epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nHealth epidemics or pandemics have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic conditions, consumer behavior, labor availability and supply chain management, as well as local operations in impacted markets, all of which can adversely affect our business, financial results and outlook. Governmental responses to health epidemics or pandemics, including operational restrictions, can also affect the foregoing items and adversely affect our business and financial results. The duration and scope of a health epidemic or pandemic can be difficult to predict and depends on many factors, including the emergence of new variants and the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of preventative measures. A health epidemic or pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these risk factors, including, but not limited to, those related to the availability and costs of labor and commodities, supply chain interruptions, consumer behavior, and consumer perceptions of our brand and industry.\nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the nature, scope or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability.\nIn addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.\nThe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

[Reserved] Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.\nOverview\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\nOur financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\nNew store openings and store count\nComparable store sales\nOperating margin\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 12% to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 9% for fiscal 2023 compared to an increase of 12% in fiscal 2022. Average ticket for both the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 6%, primarily driven by pricing in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits and increased spend on partner training, as well as inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training have increased retention and in-store operational efficiencies while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers.\nFor the International segment, despite COVID-19 pandemic-related headwinds in China in the first half of the year, revenue grew 8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily driven by net new company-operated store openings and higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees. Also contributing to the increase was a 5% increase in comparable store sales, driven by customer transactions, compared to a decrease of 9% in fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased 3% in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. In fiscal 2023, we sold the assets associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestl\u00e9, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million.\nWe have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio, with revenue and operating margin growth in fiscal 2023. We expect to continue our trend of global new store growth in fiscal 2024, driven by a dynamic portfolio of store formats in the U.S. and leveraging the strength of our brand internationally. We anticipate continued benefits from increased sales leverage and pricing decisions as well as in-store operational efficiencies driven by our Reinvention Plan. We expect the inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain that impacted fiscal 2023 to moderate in fiscal 2024, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin. Absent global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.\nFinancial Highlights\nTotal net revenues increased 12% to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022.\nConsolidated operating income increased to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 operating margin was 16.3% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2022. Operating margin expansion of 200 basis points was primarily due to pricing (approximately 250 basis points), sales leverage (approximately 240 basis points) and in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 160 basis points). These increases were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages (approximately 250 basis points) and higher general and administrative expenses, primarily in support of our Reinvention Plan (approximately 130 basis points).\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal 2023 increased to $3.58, compared to EPS of $2.83 in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. This increase was partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and higher general and administrative expenses, primarily in support of our Reinvention Plan.\nCapital expenditures were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2022.\nWe returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends. We returned $6.3 billion in fiscal 2022 through share repurchases and dividends.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022\nConsolidated results of operations (in millions):\nRevenues\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 %\nChange\nNet revenues:\nCompany-operated stores $ 29,462.3 $ 26,576.1 10.9 %\nLicensed stores 4,512.7 3,655.5 23.4\nOther 2,000.6 2,018.7 (0.9)\nTotal net revenues $ 35,975.6 $ 32,250.3 11.6 %\nTotal net revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 12%, over fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($2.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($2.1 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 3% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,339 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.2 billion). These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($555 million).\nLicensed stores revenue increased $857 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($898 million), largely due to revenue growth from existing stores and the opening of 988 net new Starbucks licensed stores over the past 12 months, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($64 million).\nOther revenues decreased $18 million, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the Evolution Fresh business following its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 ($60 million), partially offset by an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($37 million).\nOperating Expenses\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\nAs a % of Total\nNet Revenues\nProduct and distribution costs $ 11,409.1 $ 10,317.4 31.7 % 32.0 %\nStore operating expenses 14,720.3 13,561.8 40.9 42.1\nOther operating expenses 539.4 461.5 1.5 1.4\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 1,362.6 1,447.9 3.8 4.5\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,441.3 2,032.0 6.8 6.3\nRestructuring and impairments 21.8 46.0 0.1 0.1\nTotal operating expenses 30,494.5 27,866.6 84.8 86.4\nIncome from equity investees 298.4 234.1 0.8 0.7\nGain from sale of assets 91.3 - 0.3 -\nOperating income $ 5,870.8 $ 4,617.8 16.3 % 14.3 %\nStore operating expenses as a % of related revenues 50.0 % 51.0 %\nProduct and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to pricing (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 80 basis points).\nStore operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 160 basis points), sales leverage (approximately 160 basis points) and pricing (approximately 160 basis points). These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 290 basis points) and increased spend on partner training (approximately 30 basis points).\nOther operating expenses increased $78 million, primarily due to higher strategic investments in technology and other initiatives ($32 million) and support costs for our growing licensed markets ($25 million).\nDepreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to lapping amortization expenses of acquisition-related intangibles assets that are now fully amortized.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $409.3 million, primarily due to incremental investments in technology ($140 million), increased support costs of strategic initiatives including the Reinvention Plan ($86 million), higher performance-based compensation ($74 million) and other labor and leadership support costs ($31 million).\nIncome from equity investees increased $64 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture ($64 million).\nGain from sale of assets includes the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestl\u00e9 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 200 basis points in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022.\nOther Income and Expenses\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\nAs a % of Total\nNet Revenues\nOperating income $ 5,870.8 $ 4,617.8 16.3 % 14.3 %\nInterest income and other, net 81.2 97.0 0.2 0.3\nInterest expense (550.1) (482.9) (1.5) (1.5)\nEarnings before income taxes 5,401.9 4,231.9 15.0 13.1\nIncome tax expense 1,277.2 948.5 3.6 2.9\nNet earnings including noncontrolling interests 4,124.7 3,283.4 11.5 10.2\nNet earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.2 1.8 0.0 0.0\nNet earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 4,124.5 $ 3,281.6 11.5 % 10.2 %\nEffective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 23.6 % 22.4 %\nInterest income and other, net decreased $16 million, primarily due to lapping higher investment gains in the prior year.\nInterest expense increased $67 million primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.6% compared to 22.4% for fiscal 2022.The increase was due to lapping a beneficial return-to-provision adjustment related to the divestiture of certain joint venture operations (approximately 50 basis points) and a year-over-year decrease in beneficial valuation allowance activity related to international jurisdictions (approximately 40 basis points). See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.\nSegment Information\nResults of operations by segment (in millions):\nNorth America\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\nAs a % of North America\nTotal Net Revenues\nNet revenues:\nCompany-operated stores $ 23,905.4 $ 21,214.2 90.0 % 90.8 %\nLicensed stores 2,659.1 2,150.5 10.0 9.2\nOther 5.1 6.1 0.0 0.0\nTotal net revenues 26,569.6 23,370.8 100.0 100.0\nProduct and distribution costs 7,530.4 6,677.2 28.3 28.6\nStore operating expenses 11,959.2 10,860.0 45.0 46.5\nOther operating expenses 263.8 202.1 1.0 0.9\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 910.1 808.4 3.4 3.5\nGeneral and administrative expenses 389.7 303.3 1.5 1.3\nRestructuring and impairments 20.7 33.3 0.1 0.1\nTotal operating expenses 21,073.9 18,884.3 79.3 80.8\nOperating income $ 5,495.7 $ 4,486.5 20.7 % 19.2 %\nStore operating expenses as a % of related revenues 50.0 % 51.2 %\nRevenues\nNorth America total net revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $3.2 billion, or 14%, primarily due to a 9% increase in comparable store sales ($1.9 billion) driven by a 6% increase in average ticket and a 3% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing to the increase were the performance of net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($813 million) and higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($487 million).\nOperating Margin\nNorth America operating income for fiscal 2023 increased 22% to $5.5 billion, compared to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 20.7%, primarily due to pricing (approximately 300 basis points), in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 230 basis points) and sales leverage. These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 300 basis points) and increased spend on partner training (approximately 40 basis points), as well as inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 80 basis points).\nInternational\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\nAs a % of International\nTotal Net Revenues\nNet revenues:\nCompany-operated stores $ 5,556.9 $ 5,361.9 74.2 % 77.3 %\nLicensed stores 1,853.6 1,505.0 24.8 21.7\nOther 77.1 73.2 1.0 1.1\nTotal net revenues 7,487.6 6,940.1 100.0 100.0\nProduct and distribution costs 2,608.4 2,357.7 34.8 34.0\nStore operating expenses 2,761.1 2,701.8 36.9 38.9\nOther operating expenses 219.0 191.4 2.9 2.8\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 335.1 513.0 4.5 7.4\nGeneral and administrative expenses 335.8 345.3 4.5 5.0\nTotal operating expenses 6,259.4 6,109.2 83.6 88.0\nIncome from equity investees 2.7 2.3 0.0 0.0\nOperating income $ 1,230.9 $ 833.2 16.4 % 12.0 %\nStore operating expenses as a % of related revenues 49.7 % 50.4 %\nRevenues\nInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $548 million, or 7.9%, primarily due to 927 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 12% increase over the past 12 months ($421 million), as well as higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($411 million). Also contributing to the increase was a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($233 million), primarily driven by customer transactions. These were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($543 million).\nOperating Margin\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2023 increased 48% to $1.2 billion, compared to $833.2 million in fiscal 2022. Operating margin increased 440 basis points to 16.4%, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 270 basis points) and lapping amortization expenses of acquisition-related intangibles assets that are now fully amortized (approximately 240 basis points).\nChannel Development\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\nAs a % of Channel Development\nTotal Net Revenues\nNet revenues $ 1,893.8 $ 1,843.6\nProduct and distribution costs 1,250.1 1,194.2 66.0 % 64.8 %\nOther operating expenses 54.6 51.6 2.9 2.8\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0\nGeneral and administrative expenses 8.4 12.2 0.4 0.7\nTotal operating expenses 1,313.2 1,258.1 69.3 68.2\nIncome from equity investees 295.7 231.8 15.6 12.6\nGain from sale of assets 91.3 - 4.8 -\nOperating income $ 967.6 $ 817.3 51.1 % 44.3 %\nRevenues\nChannel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $50 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue ($37 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($22 million).\nOperating Margin\nChannel Development operating income for fiscal 2023 increased 18% to $968 million, compared to $817 million in fiscal 2022. Operating margin increased 680 basis points to 51.1%, primarily due to the gain from sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand (approximately 480 basis points) and growth in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income (approximately 300 basis points), partially offset by impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets (approximately 100 basis points).\nCorporate and Other\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 %\nChange\nNet revenues:\nOther $ 24.6 $ 95.8 (74.3) %\nTotal net revenues 24.6 95.8 (74.3)\nProduct and distribution costs 20.2 88.3 (77.1)\nOther operating expenses 2.0 16.4 (87.8)\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 117.3 126.4 (7.2)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,707.4 1,371.2 24.5\nRestructuring and impairments 1.1 12.7 (91.3)\nTotal operating expenses 1,848.0 1,615.0 14.4\nOperating loss $ (1,823.4) $ (1,519.2) 20.0 %\nCorporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and Evolution Fresh, prior to its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2023, or 20%, compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($131 million), increased support costs of strategic initiatives including the Reinvention Plan ($86 million) and higher performance-based compensation ($56 million).\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and Investment Overview\nOur cash and investments were $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\nBorrowing Capacity\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the 2021 credit facility), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Companys long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moodys and Standard & Poors rating agencies. The Base Rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of Americas prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022.\nOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2023.\nCommercial Paper\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this program.\nCredit Facilities in Japan\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market:\nA \u00a55 billion, or $33.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.\nA \u00a510 billion, or $67.0 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%.\nAs of October 1, 2023 we had \u00a55 billion, or $33.5 million, of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.\nSee Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.\nOur ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nUse of Cash\nWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.\nWe believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.\nWe regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. While we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity requirements, any foreign earnings which are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at managements discretion. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.\nDuring each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.49 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.53 per\nshare. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2023 and 2022 totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share to be paid on November 24, 2023, with an expected payout of approximately $651.2 million.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we repurchased 36.3 million shares of common stock for $4.0 billion on the open market. During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we repurchased 10.0 million shares of common stock for $1.0 billion on the open market. On March 15, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 40 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. As of October 1, 2023, 42.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.\nOther than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2024 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately $3.0 billion.\nThe following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 1, 2023, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows (in millions):\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nTotal Less than 1\nYear\n1 - 3\nYears\n3 - 5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nOperating lease obligations(1)\n$ 10,594.2 $ 1,577.6 $ 2,931.1 $ 2,206.9 $ 3,878.6\nDebt obligations\nPrincipal payments 15,519.3 1,819.3 2,750.0 1,100.0 9,850.0\nInterest payments 6,362.2 520.8 909.3 740.6 4,191.5\nPurchase obligations(2)\n1,078.4 694.6 311.4 72.4 -\nOther obligations(3)\n391.4 114.4 145.6 33.4 98.0\nTotal $ 33,945.5 $ 4,726.7 $ 7,047.4 $ 4,153.3 $ 18,018.1\n(1)Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.\n(2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 92% of total purchase obligations.\n(3)Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations, equity investment capital commitments and finance lease obligations.\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $4.4 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower inventory purchases driven by reduced coffee commodity prices, and higher net earnings during the period.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in spend on capital expenditures and increased purchases of investments in fiscal 2023, partially offset by increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023.\nCash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $5.6 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities, partially offset by an increase in net payments of commercial paper.\nCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.\nFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate\nrisk. Risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net investments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.\nThe sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2023 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI\n10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate 10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate\nCommodity hedges $ 1.2 $ (1.2) $ 33 $ (33)\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2023 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):\nIncrease/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI\n10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate 10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate\nForeign currency hedges $ 27 $ (27) $ 197 $ (197)\nEquity Security Price Risk\nWe have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 1, 2023 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLong-term Debt\nWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 1, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 1, 2023 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions):\nFair Value Decrease in Fair Value for a 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate\nLong-term debt(1)(2)\n$ 13,426 $ (820)\n(1)Amount disclosed is net of $16 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swaps. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.\n(2)Includes $750 million in Senior Notes that matured on October 1, 2023 but remained in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as the debt repayment was not made until the first day of fiscal 2024.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 1, 2023 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nOur significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below:\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.\nWe have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.\nLong-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a stores assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses.\nOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the stores historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the stores performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a stores ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded immaterial impairment charges on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\nAsset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting units goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting units past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting units performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing was completed in the third fiscal quarter. Where a quantitative assessment was performed, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value by approximately $101 billion.\nWhen assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset groups forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.\nDefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.

We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl\u00e9 established in August 2018.\nIn this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as Starbucks, the Company, we, us or our.\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. We renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes.\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\nAdditional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\nCertain prior period information on the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nFiscal Year End\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 included 52, 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week in fiscal 2021 fell in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations, commitments and contingencies, and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment.\nRestructuring\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the Reinvention Plan). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded approximately $22 million and $46 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\nIn fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal 2021, we recorded approximately $155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. This total included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\nAs of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal.\nOur cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale Debt Securities\nOur short-term and long-term investments include investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis.\nStructured Deposits\nWe hold short-term, principal-protected structured deposits that provide returns in the form of both fixed and variable yields; such variable yields are indexed to foreign exchange rates, equity-linked instruments or interest rate indices. The Company has elected to account for these using the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, resulting gains and losses were immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nWe also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. Refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion of our MDCP liability.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering\nevent indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following:\nLevel 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value.\nLevel 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities.\nLevel 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity.\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nWe record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments and the related gains and losses are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $77.1 million and $74.3 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $20.6 million and $75.6 million, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets.\nBy using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nNet Investment Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instruments gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.\nFair Value Hedges\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments\nWe also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nNormal Purchase Normal Sale\nWe enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which we expect to take delivery and to utilize in a reasonable period of time in the ordinary course of business. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5, Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments.\nReceivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses\nOur receivables are mainly generated from product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information and outside credit monitoring, and are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical experience, current market conditions and reasonable forecasts. For the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, our allowance for credit losses was $23.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, inventory reserves were $44.4 million and $43.1 million, respectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes a significant economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives.\nThe portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level.\nWe recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $91.1 million, $66.6 million and $153.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recorded $23.2 million, $14.3 million and $44.4 million of impairment losses within store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. Of the total net disposition and impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2022 and 2021, $9.6 million and $53.1 million, respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nLeases\nThe majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes.\nWe categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets.\nWe recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We review contracts for identified assets where we have the right to direct the use of the asset and record those agreements as embedded leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nOur lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (CAM) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability.\nWe generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we typically use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions.\nTotal lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels and are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and their related costs are recorded within store operating expenses.\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets.\nAdditionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required. See Note 10, Leases, for additional details. For the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, we recognized accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs of $89.5 million, due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms, which were recorded in restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings. In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, and we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value.\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets.\nWe recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above.\nIndefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change.\nThere were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. See Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nConsolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally,\nconsolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates.\nCompany-operated Store Revenues\nCompany-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point-of-sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. For products sold via delivery platforms, contractual terms are evaluated for each service provider to determine gross versus net presentation and revenues are also recognized when control of products are transferred to the customers. Delivery service fees were immaterial in the periods presented. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities.\nLicensed Store Revenues\nLicensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met.\nStored Value Cards\nStored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year.\nIn many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable.\nBreakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings. For the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, we recognized breakage revenue of $196.1 million, $196.0 million and $164.5 million in company-operated store revenues, respectively, and $18.9 million, $16.7 million and $16.6 million in licensed store revenues, respectively.\nLoyalty Program\nCustomers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (Stars) in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated and certain participating licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free products as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months.\nWhen a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms.\nOther revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl\u00e9 related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestl\u00e9 are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales.\nDeferred Revenues\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\nProduct and Distribution Costs\nProduct and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods, packaging costs and delivery-related expenses as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs.\nStore Operating Expenses\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources.\nAdvertising\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $507.8 million, $416.7 million and $305.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGovernment Subsidies\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which among other things, provided employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualified for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $210.0 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $15.6 million and $69.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. As of October 1, 2023, the deferred payroll tax payments have been remitted in full. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nStore Preopening Expenses\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (ARO) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.6 million and $26.1 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $110.3 million and $104.7 million, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the\nperiod in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available.\nStarbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets.\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met.\nCommon Stock Share Repurchases\nWe may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings (deficit).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects current expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables and available-for-sale securities. The new methodology requires entities to estimate and recognize expected credit losses each reporting period. The guidance was adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the modified retrospective approach and resulted in a $2.2 million transition adjustment to opening shareholders retained deficit on our consolidated statements of equity.\nNote 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance\nFiscal 2023\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl\u00e9 for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\nFiscal 2022\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFiscal 2021\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we sold our 50% ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. where our joint venture partner, E-Mart Inc., acquired an additional 17.5% interest and Apfin Investment Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIC Private Limited, which is a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, acquired the remaining 32.5%. The sale had a combined price of $1.175 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $864.5 million, which is included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nNote 3: Derivative Financial Instruments\nInterest Rates\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and\ntreasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency\nTo reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Gains and losses from these derivatives representing hedged components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are amortized over the life of the hedging instrument using a systematic and rational method and recognized in interest expense.\nForeign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net.\nCommodities\nDepending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5, Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\nDepending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur.\nTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nGains and losses on derivative contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as hedging instruments included in AOCI and expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months, net of tax (in millions):\nNet Gains/(Losses)\nIncluded in AOCI\nNet Gains/(Losses) Expected to be Reclassified from AOCI into Earnings within 12 Months Outstanding Contract/Debt Remaining Maturity\n(Months)\nOct 1,\n2023 Oct 2,\n2022 Oct 3,\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCoffee $ (78.1) $ 153.9 $ 197.8 $ (70.8) 6\nCross-currency swaps (0.6) (1.9) 4.4 -

The fair values of any financial instruments presented above exclude the impact of netting assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.\nAvailable-for-sale Debt Securities\nLong-term investments generally mature within 5 years. Proceeds from sales of securities were $2.5 million, $72.6 million and $134.1 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Realized gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses were not material as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nMarketable equity securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $90.4 million and $85.9 million as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are described further in Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, ROU assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and ROU assets is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nWe recognized impairments during fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021. Impairments recognized in the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021 were primarily related to our restructuring plan. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 10, Leases for additional discussion of these impairments.\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\nThe estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9, Debt.\nNote 5: Inventories (in millions)\nOct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022\nCoffee:\nUnroasted $ 747.7 $ 1,018.6\nRoasted 280.3 310.3\nOther merchandise held for sale 364.6 430.9\nPackaging and other supplies 413.8 416.8\nTotal $ 1,806.4 $ 2,176.6\nOther merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware, food and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations.\nAs of October 1, 2023, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $412 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $577 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base C coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to fix the base C coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base C coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.\nNote 6: Equity Investments (in millions)\nOct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 415.7 $ 283.1\nOther investments 24.2 28.1\nTotal $ 439.9 $ 311.2\nEquity Method Investments\nAs of October 1, 2023, we had a 50% ownership interest in Tata Starbucks Limited (India), which operates licensed Starbucks\u00ae retail stores.\nWe also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our 50% owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks\u00ae beverages,\nincluding Frappuccino coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot espresso drinks, Starbucks\u00ae Iced Espresso Classics and Starbucks\u00ae Iced Coffee.\nOur share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings.

The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Companys long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moodys and Standard & Poors rating agencies. The Base Rate is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of Americas prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022.\nShort-term Debt\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this program.\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market:\nA \u00a55 billion, or $33.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024.

During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, we recognized accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs of $89.5 million, which were recognized within restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statements of earnings.

The up-front payment of approximately $7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestl\u00e9 access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations.\nAs of October 1, 2023, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestl\u00e9 up-front payment was $177.0 million and $6.0 billion, respectively.

The total fair value of RSUs vested was $292 million, $298 million and $226 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was $107.71 and $96.05, respectively.\nStock Options\nWe may provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. Stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or one year from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. No stock options were granted during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\nThe fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2021:\nStock Options\nGranted During the Period\nFiscal Year Ended 2021\nExpected term (in years) 8.1\nExpected stock price volatility 26.3 %\nRisk-free interest rate 1.4 %\nExpected dividend yield 1.6 %\nWeighted average grant price $ 110.46\nEstimated fair value per option granted $ 27.59\nThe expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nStock option transactions for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts):\nShares\nSubject to\nOptions Weighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nper Share Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife (Years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding, October 2, 2022 4.1 $ 55.86 3.6 $ 117\nGranted - -\nExercised (2.1) 56.55\nExpired/forfeited 0.0 50.26\nOutstanding, October 1, 2023 2.0 55.16 2.3 72\nExercisable, October 1, 2023 2.0 55.16 2.3 72\nVested, October 1, 2023 2.0 55.16 2.3 72\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above, which is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated.\nAs of October 1, 2023, all options outstanding were vested and exercisable. No options vested during fiscal 2023. The total fair value of options vested was $8 million and $14 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $98 million, $57 million and $219 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nESPP\nOur ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95% of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.5 million in fiscal 2023.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws.\nOur matching contributions to all U.S. and non-U.S. plans were $178.1 million, $156.7 million and $145.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 14: Income Taxes\nComponents of earnings before income taxes (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021\nUnited States $ 4,488.6 $ 3,484.9 $ 4,138.5\nForeign 913.3 747.0 1,218.4\nTotal earnings before income taxes $ 5,401.9 $ 4,231.9 $ 5,356.9\nProvision/(benefit) for income taxes (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021\nCurrent taxes:\nU.S. federal $ 678.2 $ 477.6 $ 681.8\nU.S. state and local 235.9 164.0 190.0\nForeign 422.4 283.8 409.8\nTotal current taxes 1,336.5 925.4 1,281.6\nDeferred taxes:\nU.S. federal 117.0 92.6 10.4\nU.S. state and local (0.8) 10.5 (6.4)\nForeign (175.5) (80.0) (129.0)\nTotal deferred taxes (59.3) 23.1 (125.0)\nTotal income tax expense $ 1,277.2 $ 948.5 $ 1,156.6\nReconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate with our effective income tax rate:\nFiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021\nStatutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 3.4 3.3 2.7\nForeign rate differential 0.4 0.3 0.5\nChange in tax rates 0.0 0.0 (1.3)\nOther, net (1.2) (2.2) (1.3)\nEffective tax rate 23.6 % 22.4 % 21.6 %\nAs of October 1, 2023, in certain foreign subsidiaries in which we are partially indefinitely reinvested, the gross taxable temporary difference between the accounting basis and tax basis was approximately $2.5 billion for which there could be up to approximately $250 million of unrecognized tax liability.\nTax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that comprise significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions):\nOct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nOperating lease liabilities $ 2,395.3 $ 2,289.1\nStored value card liability and deferred revenue 1,638.1 1,662.6\nIntangible assets and goodwill 313.4 313.6\nOther 642.3 605.7\nTotal 4,989.1 4,871.0\nValuation allowance (148.6) (228.7)\nTotal deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance 4,840.5 4,642.3\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nOperating lease, right-of-use assets (2,291.8) (2,194.3)\nProperty, plant and equipment (525.4) (482.2)\nOther (268.1) (284.7)\nTotal (3,085.3) (2,961.2)\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $ 1,755.2 $ 1,681.1\nReported as:\nDeferred income tax assets $ 1,769.8 $ 1,799.7\nDeferred income tax liabilities (included in Other long-term liabilities) (14.6) (118.6)\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $ 1,755.2 $ 1,681.1\nThe valuation allowances as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 were primarily related to net operating losses and other deferred tax assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of October 1, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $70.8 million which have an indefinite carryforward period, federal tax credit carryforwards of $50.4 million which will begin to expire in fiscal 2030 and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $434.8 million, of which $95.4 million have an indefinite carryforward period and the remainder will begin to expire in fiscal 2024.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of October 1, 2023, we had $105.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which $72.8 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized an expense of $5.7 million, an expense of $2.3 million and a benefit of $4.6 million of interest and penalties in income tax expense, prior to the benefit of the federal tax deduction, for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome Taxes - Indefinite Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings - Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, (ASC 740), there is a presumption that investments in foreign subsidiaries will be recovered upon sale or through a partial or complete distribution of earnings to the parent entity, and therefore subject the parent entity to additional taxes. If sufficient evidence shows the foreign subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, the ASC 740 presumption may be overcome, and no additional taxes shall be accrued. The Company has investments in the profitable operations of certain foreign subsidiaries that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and/or U.S. federal and state income taxes upon sale or a partial or complete distribution of earnings, incremental to local income taxes already paid. As of October 1, 2023, the Company is partially indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has recorded an immaterial deferred tax liability related to the taxable temporary difference for which it is not indefinitely reinvested. For the remaining $2.5 billion of taxable temporary difference, there could be up to approximately $250 million of unrecognized tax liability.\nThe Companys assertion of partial indefinite reinvestment for certain foreign subsidiaries requires management to make long-term forecasting assumptions and detailed plans for reinvestment. The most significant assumption supporting the Companys indefinite reinvestment assertion is the forecast of capital expenditures in international markets. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements indefinite reinvestment analysis and capital expenditures forecast required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists.\nHow the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures related to managements indefinite reinvestment analysis and the supporting forecast of capital expenditures for certain foreign subsidiaries, included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to managements forecast of capital expenditures.\nWe performed a retrospective review of managements historical ability to accurately forecast capital expenditures by comparing actual results to managements historical forecast.\nWe inquired of senior executives of the Company to corroborate strategic plans for growth.\nWe compared the forecasts obtained to support the indefinite reinvestment assertion to:\n\u25e6Historical capital expenditures, including costs per new store opening;\n\u25e6Historical new store growth; and\n\u25e6Historical profitability of new stores by region; and\n\u25e6Forecasts used by the Company for financial reporting purposes in other areas, such as the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill; and\n\u25e6Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors; and\n\u25e6Forecasted information included in the Companys press releases, other external communications and analyst reports; and\n\u25e6External publications of expected industry growth.\nWith the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of managements analysis under ASC 740 and the sufficiency of the evidence provided by management to support that the Company has the intent and ability to partially indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nNovember 17, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1987. Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNot applicable. Item 9A.Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (October 1, 2023).\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.\nThe certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this 10-K.\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 1, 2023.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 1, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nNovember 17, 2023 Item 9B.Other Information\nInsider Adoption or Termination of Trading Arrangements:\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2023, none of our directors or officers informed us of the adoption or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as those terms are defined in Regulation S-K, Item 408, except as described in the table below:\nName & Title\nDate Adopted\nCharacter of Trading Arrangement (1)\nAggregate Number of Shares of Common Stock to be Purchased or Sold Pursuant to Trading Arrangement\nDuration (3)\nOther Material Terms\nDate Terminated\nSara Kelly,\nexecutive vice president, chief partner officer August 5, 2023 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement\nUp to 3,500 shares to be Sold (2)\n6/7/2024 (4)\nN/A\nN/A\n(1) Except as indicated by footnote, each trading arrangement marked as a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangement is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c), as amended (the Rule).\n(2) Ms. Kellys trading plan provides for the sale of up to 500 shares on a monthly basis beginning in November 2023 with 250 shares subject to a limit price of $110.\n(3) Except as indicated by footnote, each trading arrangement permitted or permits transactions through and including the earlier to occur of (a) the completion of all purchases or sales or the expiration of all of the orders relating to such trades, or (b) the date listed in the table.
