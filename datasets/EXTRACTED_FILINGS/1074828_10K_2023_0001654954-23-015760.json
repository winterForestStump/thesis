    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nOverview\nKnow Labs is an emerging leader in non-invasive medical diagnostics. We are focused on the development and commercialization of our proprietary sensor technology utilizing radio and microwave spectroscopy. When paired with our machine learning platform, our technology is capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify, and measure the unique signature of said materials or analytes.\nThe first application of our sensor technology is in a product to non-invasively monitor blood glucose levels. Our device will provide the user with real-time information on their blood glucose levels. We recently announced our Generation 1 working prototype device. This device embodies the sensor which has been used in internal clinical testing. We have also announced the work our R&D team is doing on the Generation 2 of our device, which is a wearable format and could be a final form factor, ready for commercial application. We are expanding our testing, both internally and externally, and will refine the device over time, which will require FDA clearance before entering the market.\nFollowing FDA clearance of our non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device, Know Labs plans to expand its sensor technology to other non-invasive medical diagnostic applications. As a platform technology, it can identify numerous other analytes in the human body that are important in medical diagnostics and human health and wellness.\nWhile medical diagnostics applications, with blood glucose monitoring paramount, are the focus of Know Labs, the Companys proprietary radio frequency and microwave spectroscopy platform have broad applicability outside of the medical diagnostic realm. Over time, as resources allow, the Company will explore those opportunities.\nCorporate History and Structure\nKnow Labs, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, our company has been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary spectroscopic technologies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum.\nKnow Labs has one wholly owned subsidiary, Particle, Inc. incorporated on April 30, 2020. AI Mind, Inc., Know Labs former wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated on September 17, 2021 and dissolved in early 2023. At this time there is no material activity in the Particle subsidiary while the Company gives all of its attention to its focus on its sensor technology and glucose monitoring device development.\nThe Know Labs Technology\nWe have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technology to uniquely identify and measure almost any organic and inorganic material or analyte. Our patented technology utilizes electromagnetic energy along a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light and infrared to radio wave and microwave wavelengths to perform analytics which allow the user to accurately identify and measure materials and analytes.\nOur technology provides a unique platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As a platform technology, it is analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. Our radio frequency spectroscopy technology is an enabling technology that brings the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technology is foundational and, as such, the basis upon which we believe significant businesses can be built. While we are pursuing our core focus on commercializing our glucose monitor, we believe non-core clinical, non-clinical and medical research applications represent a multitude of opportunities for strategic collaboration, joint development, and licensing agreements with leading companies in their respective industries.\nWe believe an important competitive differentiator for our sensor technology to be its ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so non-invasively, and in real-time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring.\nKnow Labs Sensor Technology: Hardware and Software\nOur sensor technology embodies two key components: hardware and software. The key hardware component includes a sensor which both sends and receives a radio frequency signal. The data obtained by the receiving aspect of the sensor is analyzed by software. Today, the sensor portion of our hardware development is complete. This sensor is currently being used in our internal tests, and has been for the past several months, gathering millions of data points to further refine our algorithm. It is the core component in our Generation 1 working prototype device and the Generation 2 device under development. This sensor technology will be the core component of future versions of our devices.\nAs a consequence, a significant amount of our focus has shifted to algorithm development. This involves sophisticated development of algorithms which derive meaningful information from the raw data obtained by our sensor. These algorithms are developed through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) by means of training various models. We will continue data collection to further refine the accuracy of the algorithm until we feel confident that we can be successful in FDA clinical trials and bring to the market the first non-invasive blood glucose monitor.\nEarly Results\nWe previously announced the results of an internal exploratory study comparing tests between our sensor technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre\u00ae) and DexCom (G6\u00ae). These results provided evidence of a high degree of correlation between our technology and the current industry leaders and their continuous glucose monitors. Our patented technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as our technology completely non-invasively monitors blood glucose levels. We also believe our technology successfully addresses the limiting qualities of non-invasive optical technologies whose diagnostic capacities may be inhibited by skin tones and other factors.\nWe are currently underway with an internal study comparing data from our sensor technology and lab-based reference devices, the Nova Primary and Nova Stat Strip. We have also expanded our study to include participants with diabetes, an important step in clinical development. These studies will allow us to further refine our algorithm and obtain results compared to lab-based reference devices, which will be required for future FDA clearance.\nWe continue to build the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize our technology. Our ability to obtain exacting results from the data collected through our sensor technology is enabled by our trade secret algorithms built through our machine learning platform. We have been refining these algorithms so they can accurately determine blood glucose levels across a broad population. We believe our algorithms can also provide accurate measurements for blood alcohol and blood oxygen levels, which we have identified in preliminary tests. We expect them to provide the analytics for the long list of other potential analytes in the human body many of which are set forth in our issued patent USPTO 11,033,208 B1.\nValidation and FDA Clearance\nWe are also focused on building strong external validation of the technology. This on-going initiative should provide additional evidence and support as we look to approach FDA approval. Over the past year, we have announced several significant validating studies. They include:\nThe results of a proof-of-principle study titled, Detecting Unique Analyte-Specific Radio Frequency Spectral Responses in Liquid Solutions, Implications for Non-Invasive Physiologic Monitoring. This study was conducted in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, sponsored by the Company, and its results were presented at the 2023 American Physiological Society (APS) Summit. The study demonstrated the accuracy of the sensor in quantifying three different analytes in vitro. In the peer-reviewed publication, it was found Bio-RFID achieved 100% accuracy in quantifying these three different analytes in vitro. The study was peer-reviewed by Sensors Journal and American Physiology Society.\nThe results of our technical feasibility study titled, Technical Feasibility of a Novel Sensor for Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Compared to Dexcom G6\u00ae. These results were presented at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Annual Meeting in Seattle, WA in ___, 202_. The study was performed by the Know Labs Clinical Development Team at Know Labs Research Laboratory in Seattle. The purpose of this technical feasibility study was to demonstrate hardware and software infrastructure stability, and to collect additional data to determine the accuracy of the sensor at quantifying BGC in vivo non-invasively using radio frequency by means of training a neural network (NN) model to predict readings of the Dexcom G6\u00ae as a proxy for BGC. The study was peer-reviewed by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology.\nThe results of a new study titled, \"Algorithm Refinement in the Non-Invasive Detection of Blood Glucose Using Know Labs Bio-RFID Technology.\" The study demonstrates that algorithm optimization using a light gradient-boosting machine (lightGBM) machine learning model improved the accuracy of Know Labs Bio-RFID\u2122 sensor technology at quantifying blood glucose using predicted readings of the Dexcom G6\u00ae as a proxy for BGC, demonstrating an overall Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 12.9% - which is within the range of independently reported values for certain FDA-cleared blood glucose monitoring devices. The study was performed by the Know Labs Clinical Development Team at Know Labs Research Laboratory in Seattle, and reviewed by members of Know Labs' Scientific Advisory Board.\nThe results from a new study6 titled, \"Novel data preprocessing techniques in an expanded dataset improve machine learning model accuracy for a non-invasive blood glucose monitor.\" The study demonstrates that continued algorithm refinement and more high-quality data improved the accuracy of Know Labs proprietary Bio-RFID sensor technology, resulting in an overall Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 11.3%. As with all Know Labs previous research, this study was designed to assess the ability of the Bio-RFID sensor to non-invasively and continuously quantify blood glucose, using the Dexcom G6\u00ae continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as a reference device and proxy for BGC. In this new study where data collection was completed in May of 2023, Know Labs applied novel data preprocessing techniques and trained a light gradient-boosting machine (lightGBM) model to predict blood glucose values of Dexcom G6\u00ae CGM using 3,311 observations - or reference device values - from over 330 hours of data collected from 13 healthy participants. With this method, Know Labs was able to predict blood glucose in the test set - the dataset that provides a blind evaluation of model performance - with a MARD of 11.3%. The study was performed by the Know Labs Clinical Development Team at Know Labs Research Laboratory in Seattle and reviewed by members of Know Labs' Scientific Advisory Board.\nAs the Company successfully completed our foundational studies, created a stable sensor that delivers repeatable results, and developed a software infrastructure to manage and interpret large, novel datasets, it will continue to expand its testing and data gathering with larger and more diverse populations in order to continue increasing the accuracy of our algorithms across diverse populations.\nWe have also begun the internal and external process to pursue FDA clearance for our non-invasive blood glucose monitor. Our Chief Medical Officer, medical and regulatory advisory board, our entire executive team along with external advisors guide us in this process. Additionally, our third-party quality assurance and documentation consultants help ensure that the rigorous requirements of FDA are met. We are unable to estimate the time necessary for FDA approval or the likelihood of success in that endeavor.\nProduct Strategy\nWe have announced the development of our non-invasive glucose monitor and our desire to obtain FDA clearance for the marketing of this product. We are currently undertaking internal development work of this product for the commercial marketplace. We have also announced the engagement of several strategic partners and advisors focused on sensor technology, product design, data science, machine learning, manufacturing and regulatory affairs, who we will work with to bring this product to market. The announcement of our Generation 1 working prototype device was a significant milestone for the Company. It has been used in internal clinical testing and will gather significant amounts of data with diverse populations which will allow us to refine the design of the next generation device. We have also announced the work being done on the Generation 2 prototype device, which is a wearable format and we expect to be a potential final format that would be presented to the FDA for market clearance. We will make further announcements regarding the product as development, testing, manufacturing, and regulatory approval work progresses.\nOur efforts are entirely focused on productizing our sensor technology and collecting high quality data for validation purposes, including third-party studies, and appropriate and required clinical trials. At this point in our development cycle, the hardware continues to be miniaturized and optimized, the product form factor is moving in the direction of a final product that will be used for FDA clinical trials and the algorithms which provide results from the data collected by our sensor are being refined to improve accuracy.\nSales and Marketing\nWhile we continue with our internal development efforts and the move toward clinical trials for FDA clearance of our non-invasive blood glucose monitor, we will explore the several potential avenues for moving our first product and potential follow-on products into the marketplace. The avenues being explored include direct to consumer, initial launch partners, broad distribution partners, licensing partners and private label approaches to the market, among others. As part of our growth strategy, we have begun discussions around joint development agreements with potential biopharma, medical device, and consumer electronics partners. These would be strategic collaborations that could help us accelerate development and commercial launch. In parallel, we have begun to build our internal commercial and marketing team in preparation for detailed strategic thinking about the optimal approach to the marketplace. We attend and engage in conferences focused on diabetes management and technology, which are valuable for building Know Labs reputation and network in the space.\nCompetition\nThe technology industry, generally, and blood glucose monitoring and other medical diagnostic markets in particular, are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities by industry participants. To compete successfully, we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well-established alternative solutions, products, and technologies, including legacy providers of blood glucose monitoring technology, as well as newer ones that are working to achieve a non-invasive solution or more acceptable blood glucose monitoring solutions which may or may not be similar to our technology, and convince consumers and enterprises of the advantages of our products and technologies.\nWe group our competition into three large categories. Those are (i) large global technology companies who may enter the blood glucose monitoring and other medical diagnostic markets, (ii) legacy providers of blood glucose monitoring technology, and (iii) new entrants working to achieve a non-invasive solution or more acceptable blood glucose monitoring solutions which may or may not be similar to our technology. With regard to companies in each category, we perform due diligence from all publicly available sources of information on their relevant technologies and their product plans. This information informs and refines our activities and underscores our sense of urgency as we work to bring our own technology to the marketplace. As it relates to all competitors, we continue to focus on building the worlds most robust patent portfolio in this space. PatSnap Research and ipCapital Group, two leading patent analytic firms, have ranked Know Labs #1 for global patent leadership in non-invasive glucose monitoring patents. We have retained both organizations to perform patent related work. We continue to build out our patent portfolio and grow our trade secret AI and ML driven algorithms. Patents issued, pending, and in-process increased from 107 to 259 YoY (+142% vs. market +35%) reflecting our high rate of innovation.\nWith respect to our planned non-invasive glucose monitor, we will face direct and indirect competition from a number of competitors who have developed or are developing products for continuous monitoring of glucose levels. These competitors include DexCom, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc, Roche Diagnostics, LifeScan, Inc., Ascensia Diabetes Care Holdings AG, Senseonics Holdings, Inc., Integrity Applications, Inc., Nemaura Medical, Biolinq Inc., and Profusa, Inc. Our planned solution will also compete with traditional glucometers, which remain an inexpensive alternative. We also compete with companies who are seeking to create non-invasive glucose monitors, such as Movano, Inc., Hagar, and DiaMonTech AG. Because of the large size of the potential market for our products, it is possible that new or existing competitors may develop competing products, procedures, or clinical solutions that could prove to be more effective, safer, or less costly than our solution. The introduction of new products, procedures, or clinical solutions by competitors may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, or may render our products obsolete. Many of the companies we will compete with enjoy significantly greater name recognition and have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and sales and marketing of approved products than we have.\nMergers and acquisitions in the medical device, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Other small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. There are also several academic and other institutions involved in various phases of technology development regarding blood glucose monitoring devices.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe our key competitive strengths include:\n\u00b7\nThrough first principles, our sensor technologys ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so non-invasively, accurately, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring.\n\u00b7\nOur sensor technology is non-invasive, using radio waves to identify and measure what is going on inside the body in real-time.\n\u00b7\nOur sensor technology platform can be integrated into a variety of wearable, mobile, or counter-top form factors, and we believe eventual interoperability with existing products from current market leaders.\n\u00b7\nNo needles nor invasive transmitters in your body, making our sensor convenient and pain-free.\n\u00b7\nNo expensive supplies, such as test strips and lancets, are required to operate our device.\n\u00b7\nA core focus on accessibility and affordability for the populations we will serve around the globe.\n\u00b7\nThe current prototype sensor collects approximately 1.5 million data points per hour, which allows us to potentially build a deep understanding of health and wellness that other sensors may not be able to.\n\u00b7\nKnow Labs is the world intellectual property leader in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, according to ipCG Capital and PatSnap.\nGrowth Strategy\nThe key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:\n\u00b7\nInitially, entering the diabetes glucose monitoring market with our non-invasive glucose monitoring device.\n\u00b7\nFollowing our entry into the glucose monitoring market, entering other clinical monitoring markets for continuous, non-invasive hormone, medication metabolites, endocrinology components, and biomolecular monitoring.\n\u00b7\nApplying our platform technology to lifestyle analysis, clinical trials, and chronic illnesses. We believe that potential use cases include real-time wearable medication monitoring and detection of, for example, ovulation and hormone deficiency.\n\u00b7\nWith an ever-growing body of non-invasively determined analytes available from individuals utilizing our technology we believe, over time, with longitudinal data we will be able to engage in so-called predictive health and provide early warnings of the onset of disease.\n\u00b7\nSignificantly, every new application will function utilizing the same sensor. We expect that hardware changes will not be required to target new analytes, so you will not need a new device, but an updated software algorithm will be required.\n\u00b7\nEach new application provides potential new opportunities for monetization of the platform technology. Each additional analyte we identify over time may require its own subsequent FDA approval.\nResearch and Development\nOur current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving our radio frequency spectroscopy technology for the monitoring of blood glucose. As part of this effort, we continuously perform clinical testing of our devices following IRB-approved protocols, and we conduct on-going laboratory testing to ensure that application methods are compatible with the end-user and regulatory requirements, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. As resources permit, we plan to focus on extending the capacity of our sensor technology to identify new analytes and applications. Our current internal team along with outside consultants have considerable experience working with the application of our technologies. We engage third party experts as required to supplement our internal team. We incurred expenses of $7,727,000 and $5,386,000 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on development activities.\nIntellectual Property\nThe cornerstone of our foundational platform technology is our intellectual property portfolio. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy which includes focus on patents where appropriate and a diligent protection of trade secrets. To date, we have been granted 32 patents and 22 design patents. These include 13 patents on our early work on the visible and near visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, which were a point of creative departure as we explored and invented our current radio frequency sensor technology. We currently have a number of patents pending and continue, on a regular basis, with the filing of new patents. If we include pending patents, our IP portfolio reaches 215 patents issued and pending, which positions the company as the top worldwide IP holder in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, according to ipCapital Group, a leading IP and innovation consulting firm. We possess all rights, title and interest to the issued patents.\nOur issued patents will expire at various times between 2027 and 2047. Pending patents, if and when issued, may have expiration dates that extend further in time. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nThe issued patents cover the fundamental aspects of our radio frequency spectroscopy technology and a number of unique applications. We have filed patents, which are pending, on the additional fundamental aspects of our technology and growing number of unique applications. We will continue, over time, to expand our patent portfolio.\nAdditionally, significant aspects of our technology are maintained as trade secrets which may not be disclosed through the patent filing process. We are diligent in maintaining and securing our trade secrets, in particular as they involve our AI and ML driven algorithms.\nWe shall also have an exclusive, perpetual and royalty free right to any patent(s) or other intellectual property which Phillip Bosua, someone working under direction of Phillip Bosua, or any successor or assignee develops, relating to Know Labs technology within a period of five years after January 23, 2023.\nRelated Patent Assets\nInherent in a platform technology is the ability to develop or license technology in diverse fields of use apart from our core focus. We focus on human health and wellness with a first focus on the non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose. We plan to pursue the identification of a multitude of analytes in the human body that are important to diagnostics over time. We also plan to identify, over time, opportunities for our intellectual property to be deployed in areas outside of human health and wellness.\nWe may, although we cannot guarantee that we will, create other such subsidiaries over time. Additionally, we may license our intellectual property to third parties so that they may pursue activities that are not a part of our core focus.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had eleven full-time and part-time employees. Our senior management and other personnel are co-located in our Seattle, Washington offices and remote. The Company expanded its utilization of consulting firms and individual contractors to supplement our reduced workforce in an effort to reduce fixed expenses and extend operating resources.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations are subject to comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we or our research and development partners do business. The laws and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws and regulations are subject to frequent change. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our research and development partners and affiliates, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations relating to medical that apply to our business and that of our partners and affiliates continue to evolve, and we must, therefore, devote significant resources to monitoring developments in legislation, enforcement, and regulation in such areas. As the applicable laws and regulations change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. We cannot provide assurance that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.\nUnited States FDA Regulation\nThe Know Labs glucose monitor will be designed to allow our sensor technology platform to generate a glucose value and provide the user with real-time information on their blood glucose levels. A patients glucose data will be displayed via a companion app and will be transmitted directly to certain compatible mobile devices, including iPhone\u00ae and Android\u00ae devices.\nOur medical diagnostic products and operations, initially the glucose monitor, are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, guidance documentation, and standards. Our products will be regulated by FDA as medical devices. FDA regulates the design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, sale and advertising of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the FFDCA, medical devices are generally classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk to the patient and/or the user associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Device classification also depends on the intended use of the device and upon indications for use. Additionally, the class to which your device is assigned also determines, among other things, the type of premarketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market.\nClass I includes devices with the lowest risk, present a minimal potential for harm and for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDAs general controls for medical devices. This includes compliance with the applicable portions of FDAs Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices require premarket clearance by FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below but most are exempt from 510(k) premarket notification requirements.\nClass II devices are moderate risk devices that present a higher risk than Class I devices. Class II devices subject to FDAs general controls, and any other special controls deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. If FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, then FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements. Additionally, unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees.\nClass III includes those with the greatest risk as they sustain or support life, are implanted, or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. In other words, Class III devices consist of devices deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is generally required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. Additionally, as with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees.\nTo determine the classification a product may be subject to you can use three different methods - searching for an appropriate product classification via FDAs Product classification database; searching for a similar device by clearance or approval via FDAs 510(k) Clearance Database, PMA Database, or De Novo Database; or searching for a similar device by device listing via FDAs Establishment Registration and Device listing Database.\nThere are also De Novo and unclassified device types. Unclassified device types are pre-amendments devices (i.e., marketed prior to the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 but were not classified by the original classification panels) for which a classification regulation has not been promulgated. Until the unclassified device type has been formally classified and a regulation established by FDA, submission of a 510(k) premarket notification is generally required.\nDe Novo classification, described in more detail below, provides a marketing pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general and/or special controls provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use but for which there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence predicate device (i.e., no predicate product, new intended use, or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety and effectiveness). Devices classified into Class I or Class II through a De Novo request may be marketed and used as predicates for other future submissions, where applicable.\n510(k) Clearance\nTo obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent (i.e., as safe and effective) to a legally marketed device, known as a predicate device. A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a pre-amendments device based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process or a device that was granted marketing authorization via the De Novo classification process that is not exempt from premarket notification requirement. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, can require clinical data and non-clinical bench performance data, including engineering performance testing, sterility, electromagnetic compatibility, software validation, biocompatibility evaluation, among other data.\nBefore FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, then FDA will issue a Refuse to Accept letter which generally outlines the information FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. FDA may require additional information, including additional clinical and non-clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.\nIf FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, then it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the De Novo process.\nAfter a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter to file in which the manufacture documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nPMA Approval\nA PMA must be submitted to FDA for any device that is classified in Class III or otherwise cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process (although FDA has discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process). PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data (e.g., study protocols, adverse reactions and complications, device failures and replacements, patient information, patient complaints, tabulations of data from all individual subjects, results of statistical analyses), and non-clinical laboratory or safety studies (e.g., microbiology, toxicology, immunology, biocompatibility, stress, wear, shelf life, and other laboratory or animal tests). The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling.\nFollowing receipt of a PMA application, once FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, FDA will formally accept the application for review. FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180-days to review an accepted PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During the review period, FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to FDA as to the approvability of the device. FDA may or may not accept the panels recommendation. In addition, FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.\nIf FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If FDAs evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.\nIn approving a PMA, FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to FDA on the clinical status of those patients.\nNew PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of a PMA-approved device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the devices indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.\nDe Novo Classification\nMedical device types that FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation, or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. Under the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV), FDAs goal is to make a decision about a De Novo request in 150 review days. Review days are calculated as the number of calendar days between the date the De Novo request was received by FDA and the date of FDAs decision, excluding the days a request was on hold for an Additional Information request.\nIt is our current belief that our glucose monitoring product may require a de novo classification request. This will be further refined as we continue working closely with our regulatory consultants.\nBreakthrough Devices Program\nThe Breakthrough Devices Program is a voluntary program for certain medical devices and device-led combination products that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.\nThe goal of the Breakthrough Devices Program is to provide patients and health care providers with timely access to these medical devices by speeding up their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the statutory standards for premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, and De Novo marketing authorization, consistent with the Agencys mission to protect and promote public health.\nThe Breakthrough Devices Program replaces the Expedited Access Pathway and Priority Review for medical devices and offers manufacturers an opportunity to interact with FDA to efficiently address topics as they arise during the premarket review phase. FDA considers devices granted designation under the Expedited Access Pathway to be part of the Breakthrough Devices Program.\nAll requests for Breakthrough designation must be submitted prior to submitting a marketing submission and can be revoked by FDA at any time. Additionally, devices eligible for Breakthrough Device designation must (1) provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions; and (2) meet at least one of the following: (i) represent breakthrough technology; (ii) have no approved or cleared alternatives that exist; (iii) offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or (iv) whose availability is in the best interest of patients.\nWe may pursue the Breakthrough Devices Program for our glucose monitor product.\nClinical Studies\nWhen FDA clearance or approval of a Class I, Class II or Class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is required to file an IDE application with FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a non-significant risk, IDE submission to FDA is not required but must still follow IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and complying with labeling and record keeping requirements. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board, or IRB, overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices.\nRegardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an IRB for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by FDA.\nThe sponsor is also required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements during the clinical trial (e.g., trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices, or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them). The sponsor may transfer some or all of its obligations related to a clinical study to a third-party but is ultimately responsible for compliance regardless of whether these obligations are contractually transferred.\nThe clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDAs regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, FDA, or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.\nFDA or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States.\nPost-Marketing Restrictions and Enforcement\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nProduct listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;\n\u00b7\nReporting of potential device shortages in some circumstances, including during a public health emergency;\n\u00b7\nCompliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nunannounced routine or for-cause device facility inspections by FDA, which may include our suppliers facilities;\n\u00b7\nlabeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved off-label uses;\n\u00b7\nclearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;\n\u00b7\ncorrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health;\n\u00b7\nmedical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;\n\u00b7\npost-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;\n\u00b7\npost-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;\n\u00b7\nFDAs recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nregulations pertaining to voluntary recalls.\nAdvertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, then it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products would be impaired.\nIn addition, under FDA medical device reporting (MDR) regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device of such manufacturer were to recur. The decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by the manufacturer. If FDA disagrees with the manufacturers determination, FDA can take enforcement action.\nThe MDR requirements also extend to health care facilities that use medical devices in providing care to patients, or device user facilities, which include hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes, outpatient diagnostic facilities, or outpatient treatment facilities, but not physician offices. A device user facility must report any device-related death to both FDA and the device manufacturer, or any device-related serious injury to the manufacturer (or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to FDA) within 10 days of the event. Device user facilities are not required to report device malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur but may voluntarily report such malfunctions through MedWatch, FDAs Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.\nFDA also has the authority to require the recall of commercialized medical device products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any distributed devices fail to meet established specifications, are otherwise misbranded or adulterated under the FFDCA, or if any other material deficiency is found. FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated.\nThe failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7\nwarning letters, fines, injunctions or civil penalties;\n\u00b7\nrecalls, detentions or seizures of products;\n\u00b7\noperating restrictions;\n\u00b7\ndelays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u00b7\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u00b7\ndelay or refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant 510(k) clearance, PMA approvals, or other marketing authorization to new products;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawals of marketing authorizations; or\n\u00b7\nin the most serious cases, criminal prosecution.\nTo ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.\nFederal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight\nOur advertising for our products and services is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (the FTC Act), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.\nInternational\nAny future international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider all of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained or referred to in this report, before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. If any of the following events occur, our financial condition, business and results of operations (including cash flows) may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks summarized below. These risks are discussed more fully in the Risk Factors section immediately following this summary. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u00b7\nWe might not be able to continue as a going concern. We believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through June 30, 2024;\n\u00b7\nWe are still in the early stages of commercialization, refining our technology. Our success depends on our ability to conclude development and market devices that are recognized as accurate, safe, and cost-effective as other options currently available in the market and cleared by FDA.\n\u00b7\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by FDA, which could restrict the sales and marketing of our products and could cause us to incur significant costs;\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u00b7\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\u00b7\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on the NYSE American.\n\u00b7\nWe do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\u00b7\nFuture issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock, or the expiration of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new common stock or the trading of outstanding common stock, could cause the market price of our securities to decline and would result in the dilution of your holdings.\n\u00b7\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future issuances of preferred stock, which could rank senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividends and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the level of return you may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe need additional financing to support our technology development and ongoing operations, pay our debts and maintain ownership of our intellectual properties.\nWe are currently operating at a loss and using substantial cash to fund our operation. We believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations through June 30, 2024. We may need additional financing to implement our business plan and to service our ongoing operations, pay our current debts (described below) and maintain ownership of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any needed funding, or that if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when it is needed, we will need to restructure our operations and/or divest all or a portion of our business. We are seeking additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, and could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Equity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back, eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell that number of shares, if any.\nWe need to continue as a going concern if our business is to succeed.\nBecause we have generated limited revenues and currently operate at a loss, we are completely dependent on the continued availability of financing in order to continue our business. There can be no assurance that financing sufficient to enable us to continue our operations will be available to us in the future.\nWe have cash and cash equivalents of $8,024,000 and net working capital of approximately $6,264,000 (exclusive of convertible notes payable) as of September 30, 2023. We anticipate that we will record losses from operations for the foreseeable future. We believe that we have enough available cash to operate until June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2023, our accumulated deficit was $121,841,000. We intend to seek additional cash via equity and debt offerings. As a result of not having at least twelve months of cash available and not having any firm commitment for debt or equity financing, substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue on a going concern exists.\nWe have financed our corporate operations and our technology development through the issuance of convertible debentures, the issuance of preferred stock, the sale of common stock and the exercise of warrants. During the remainder of 2024, we expect to raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debentures or equity.\nThe proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, to the extent not exercised on a cashless basis, may generate potential proceeds. We cannot provide assurance that any of these warrants will be exercised.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we owed approximately $2,980,000 and if we do not satisfy these obligations, the lenders may have the right to demand payment in full or exercise other remedies.\nWe owe $2,762,000 under various convertible promissory notes as of September 30, 2023, including $1,301,000 to Clayton Struve who owns 100% of outstanding Series C and D Preferred stock, and $1,461,000 owed to entities controlled by Ronald P. Erickson, our CEO and Chairman. Mr. Erickson and/or entities with which he is affiliated also have accounts payable and accrued liabilities $218,000 as of September 30, 2023 related to accrued interest. We may need additional financing, to service and/or repay these debt obligations. If we raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing, we may incur substantial interest expense. If and when we raise more equity capital in the future, it will result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders.\nWe have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses since inception. As of September 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $121,841,000 and net losses in the amount of $15,289,000 and $20,071,000 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. Our operating expenses may increase as we spend resources on growing our business, and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase, our operating results and financial condition will suffer. Our businesses have produced minimal revenues and may not produce significant revenues in the near term, or at all, which would harm our ability to continue our operations or obtain additional financing and require us to reduce or discontinue our operations. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as business with an early-stage technology in a new and rapidly evolving industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could significantly harm our business, operating results, financial condition and common stock price per share.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our technology and related products to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are in the early stages of commercializing our technology. Failure to develop and sell products based upon our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To date, we have not generated revenue from sales of our technology or products. We believe that our commercialization success is dependent upon our ability to significantly increase the number of customers that will use our products. In addition, demand for our products may not materialize, or increase as quickly as planned, and we may therefore be unable to increase our revenue levels as expected. We are currently not profitable. Even if we succeed in introducing our technology and related products to our target markets, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could require us to take significant time and could cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. These regulations relate to manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution and shipping. Before a new medical device, or a new intended use of a legally marketed device, can be marketed in the United States, it must be cleared or approved by FDA through the applicable premarket review process (510(k), PMA, or de novo classification), unless an exemption applies.\nThe KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products and substantially equivalent devices of this type that may later receive marketing authorization are similar to products referred to as integrated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. Integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems are generally classified by FDA as Class II devices and have established special controls outlining requirements for assuring CGM accuracy, reliability, and clinical relevance. FDA also has descriptions of the types of studies and data required to demonstrate acceptable CGM performance. Though it is our current belief that our initial product, the KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products, are appropriate for a de novo classification request (i.e., a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device that is described in more detail below), we expect similar classification, special controls, and testing.\nIf we receive 510(k) clearance for our KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products, we may be required to obtain new 510(k) clearances for significant post-market modifications. Each premarket submission and review process can be expensive and lengthy, and entail significant user fees, unless exempt. The classification and special controls for all other products using the Companys proprietary radio frequency and microwave spectroscopy platform will be dependent on product type and explored as applicable.\nIn addition, regulatory clearance or approval by FDA does not ensure registration, clearance, approval, or certification by regulatory authorities or notified bodies internationally. While the regulatory requirements for marketing in international markets may require that we obtain clearance, approval, or certification by an international specified regulatory body or notified body. Complying with foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining registrations, clearances, approvals, or certifications, can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not receive regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications in each country or region in which we plan to market our products or we may be unable to do so on a timely basis. In turn, this could limit our expected international growth and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe clinical trial process is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes. Results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, or the safety or efficacy profile for such products.\nClinical trials are generally required to support an application for clearance of a new device type such as our KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDAs Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of Good Clinical Practice requirements, which include among other things, recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with FDAs regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by FDA.\nResults of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. In additional, the commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to submit an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, to FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing certain human clinical trials of medical devices, and FDA may reject our IDE and notify us that we may not begin clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nFDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u00b7\npatients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\npatients do not comply with trial protocols;\n\u00b7\npatient follow-up is not at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\npatients experience adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\npatients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to our products;\n\u00b7\nwe may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs), and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\ninstitutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol;\n\u00b7\nthird-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or other FDA requirements;\n\u00b7\ndata collection, monitoring, and analysis is not performed in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;\n\u00b7\nregulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions applicable to our trial protocols, including, for example, recent legislation passed by Congress requiring clinical trial sponsors to increase engagement with FDA on matters related to appropriate representation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trial data for pivotal studies;\n\u00b7\nthe interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; and\n\u00b7\nFDA concludes that the results from our trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product.\nAdditionally, the ability of FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, the availability of industry-paid user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times for product approvals at FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at FDA and other agencies, including those resulting from global concerns (e.g., the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic), may also slow the time necessary for new products to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, if a prolonged government shutdown and/or government employee furloughs were to occur, or if FDAs response to a global issue diverts FDA resources and attention to other regulatory efforts, then the ability of FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions could be significantly impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns, furloughs, or public health emergencies could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nAny of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nMoreover, even if our products are cleared in the U.S., commercialization of our products in foreign countries would require clearance or approval by regulatory authorities in those countries. Clearance or approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials.\nThe safety and efficacy of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, which could limit sales, and our products might therefore prove to be less safe or effective than initially thought.\nGiven the regulatory environment in which we operate, we lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of The KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products and the benefits it offers that might have been generated in connection with other marketing authorization pathways. For these reasons, clinicians may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. Further, future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our product does not improve patient outcomes. Such results would slow the adoption of our product by physicians, would significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected sales, and could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability.\nIn addition, because the KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products have never been marketed, we have limited complaints or patient success rate data with respect to using these products. If future patient studies or clinical testing do not support our belief that our products offer a more advantageous blood glucose monitoring, then market acceptance of our products could fail to increase or could decrease, and our business could be harmed. Moreover, if future results and experience indicate that our product has potentially recurring malfunctions or causes unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, then we could be subject to mandatory or voluntary product recalls, suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance, as well as significant legal liability or harm to our business reputation and financial results.\nIf we choose to, or are required to, conduct additional clinical studies and the outcome of such studies are not positive, then this could reduce the rate of coverage and reimbursement for the KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products. This may slow the market adoption of our product by physicians, significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and prevent us from becoming profitable.\nWe believe that publications of scientific and medical results in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at leading conferences are critical to the broad adoption of our products. Publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer-review process, and peer reviewers may not consider the results of studies involving our products sufficiently novel or worthy of publication. The failure to be listed in physician guidelines or to be published in peer-reviewed journals could limit the adoption of our products. Unless specifically stated to be peer-reviewed, the studies referred to in this filing are not peer reviewed.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation which could restrict the sales and marketing of our products and could cause us to incur significant costs.\nMedical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. Further, clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop once the device is on the market.\nThe current regulatory requirements to which we are subject may change in the future in a way that adversely affects us. If we fail to comply with present or future regulatory requirements that are applicable to us, we may be subject to enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7\nmodification to our training and promotional materials;\n\u00b7\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7\ncustomer notification, or orders for repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u00b7\nvoluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our current or future products;\n\u00b7\nadministrative detention by FDA of medical devices believed to be adulterated or misbranded;\n\u00b7\nimposing operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production;\n\u00b7\nrefusing our requests for clearance, PMA or de novo classification of any new products, new intended uses or modifications to our products;\n\u00b7\nFDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;\n\u00b7\nwithdraws or suspension of 510(k) clearance that has already been granted, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and\n\u00b7\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could result in stockholders losing their entire investment.\nAdditionally, any relationships we may have with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, and payors in connection with our current and future business activities may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose us to, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and payors play a primary role in the recommendation and/or prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain future marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, payors, and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;\n\u00b7\nthe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) starting in 2022 information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The information reported will be publicly available on a searchable website, with disclosure required annually; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nState and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For instance, the collection and use of health data in the European Union is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which extends the geographical scope of European Union data protection law to non-European Union entities under certain conditions, tightens existing European Union data protection principles, creates new obligations for companies and new rights for individuals. Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in substantial fines and other administrative penalties. In addition, on June 28, 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, and similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve on-going substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, then we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, temporary or permanent debarment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, then they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the U.S., and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u00b7\ndiffering regulatory requirements and reimbursement regimes in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u00b7\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u00b7\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nWe may face difficulties with respect to coverage and reimbursement by various payors.\nSales of any medical device depend often, in part, on the extent to which the product will be covered and reimbursed by government payors (e.g., federal and state healthcare programs), third-party payors (e.g., commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations), and other payors (e.g., foreign government healthcare programs). In the United States, various glucose monitoring products are covered for individuals with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes by Medicare and Medicaid in the majority of states and by commercial insurers, subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility and coverage criteria.\nBut significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. For example, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the payors reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.\nDecisions regarding the extent of coverage and reimbursement amount are generally made on a plan-by-plan basis meaning one payors decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide similar coverage. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product, and require providers to show medical necessity for use, to each payor separately. This process can be time-consuming, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or even obtained.\nPayors are also increasingly reducing reimbursements for devices through continued implementation of cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, which could further limit sales of any product. In addition, payors continue to question safety and efficacy while also challenging the prices charged, examining medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of devices in an effort to avoid coverage and reimbursement. But decreases of this nature surrounding the reimbursement for any product or a decision by a government and third-party payor not to cover a product could result in reduced physician usage and patient demand for the product.\nMoreover, in international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, with many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.\nThe discovery of serious safety issues with our products, or a recall of our products either voluntarily or at the direction of FDA or another governmental authority, could have a negative impact on us.\nWe are subject to FDAs medical device reporting regulations, which require us to report to FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event.\nWe may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the initial use of the device. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, FDA could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or, if premarket review is required in the future, delay in clearance of future products.\nFDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized medical device products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. FDAs authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects, or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. We cannot assure you that product defects or other errors will not occur in the future. Recalls involving our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, medical device manufacturers are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to FDA. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our devices in the future that we determine do not require notification of FDA. If FDA disagrees with our determinations, then it could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability and malpractice claims against us and negatively affect our sales.\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation, both in the U.S. as well as in other foreign jurisdictions where we may be operating.\nExisting regulations and regulatory policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Legislative changes may impact our future business and operations, including those that may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and accordingly, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under various laws and regulations. If a regulatory authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable risk for the end-user, then the authority may ban such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such instruments, and require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. A regulatory authority may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The regulatory authority may also recommend prosecution by law enforcement agencies. Any governmental law or regulation, existing or imposed in the future, or enforcement action taken may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of any legislative changes will be enacted or government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. Similarly, we cannot predict whether FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, then we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to significant or rapid technological change.\nOur fields of therapeutic interest is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. Accordingly, our success may depend, in part, on our ability to respond quickly to such change through the development and introduction of new products.\nIf our product candidates are approved by FDA, then potential competitors who seek to introduce similar product candidates may seek to take advantage of a shorter and less costly development program for a product that competes with our products. Our ability to compete successfully against currently existing and future alternatives to our product candidates and systems and competitors who compete directly with us may depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled scientific and research personnel, develop technologically superior products, develop competitively priced products, obtain patent or other required regulatory approvals for our products, be an early entrant to the market and manufacture, market, and sell our products, independently or through collaborations.\nWe currently rely in part upon external resources for engineering and product development services. If we are unable to secure an engineering or product development partner or establish satisfactory engineering and product development capabilities, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technology.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop products that are accurate and provide solutions for our customers. Achieving the desired results for our customers requires solving engineering issues in concert with them. Any failure of our technology or related products to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing methods or to adopt systems other than ours.\nHistorically, we have not had sufficient internal resources to work on all necessary engineering and product development matters. We have used third parties in the past and will continue to do so. These resources are not always readily available, and the absence of their availability could inhibit our research and development efforts and our responsiveness to our customers. Our inability to secure those resources could impact our ability to provide engineering and product development services and could have an impact on our customers willingness to use our technology. Moreover, third parties have their own internal demands on time and resources which may not always align with ours. Hence, our own expectations for development and product timelines may not be shared by third parties upon whom we rely.\nWe are in the early stages of commercialization and our technology and related products may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and market devices that are recognized as accurate, safe and cost-effective. They must be safe and deliver the required level of accuracy under any condition, regardless of the user, as determined by their intended use. This will be achieved through continue refinement of our technology. Before presenting it to the FDA, additional development is needed to increase its generalizability.\nMany of our potential customers may be reluctant to use our new technology. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including our ability to convince potential customers that our technology and related products are an attractive alternative to existing technologies. We will need to demonstrate that our products provide accurate and cost-effective alternatives to existing technologies. Compared to most competing technologies, our technology is new, and most potential customers will have limited knowledge of, or experience with, our products. Prior to implementing our technology and related products, some potential customers may be required to devote significant time and effort to testing and validating our products. Any failure of our technology or related products to meet customer expectations could result in customers choosing to retain their existing methods or to adopt systems other than ours.\nMany factors influence the perception of a new technology including its use by leaders in the industry. If we are unable to induce industry leaders in our target markets to implement and use our technology and related products, acceptance and adoption of our products could be slowed. In addition, if our products fail to gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and we are unable to expand our customer base, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in international markets or encounter difficulty expanding into international markets because of limited brand recognition in certain parts of the world, which may lead to delayed acceptance of our products by consumers in these international markets. If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of international operations successfully, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our efforts to introduce our products into foreign markets are not successful, then we may have expended significant resources without realizing the expected benefit. Ultimately, the investment required for expansion into foreign markets could exceed the results of operations generated from this expansion.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management and other personnel, some of whom could be difficult to replace. While our continued operation and ultimate success is not dependent upon one individual, our success does depend on the performance of our officers, our ability to retain and motivate our officers, our ability to integrate new officers into our operations, and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team. Our failure to retain and recruit officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, we may encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, which could harm our ability to develop new products and adversely impact our relationships with existing and future customers. The inability to attract and retain necessary technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel could harm our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on the timely supply of components and parts and could suffer if suppliers fail to meet their delivery obligations, raise prices or cease to supply us with components or parts.\nThe manufacture of our products is complex and requires the integration of a number of components from several sources of supply. We rely on numerous critical suppliers for various key components that are used in the manufacturing of our products. We can make no assurance that we will be able to maintain such supply arrangements. If we are unable to maintain supply arrangements, our access to key components could be reduced, which could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if demand for our products decreases, we may have excess inventory and inventory that may expire, which could result in inventory write-offs that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also encounter defects in materials and/or workmanship, which could lead to a failure to adhere to regulatory requirements. Any defects could delay operations at our contract manufacturers facilities, lead to regulatory fines, or halt or discontinue manufacturing indefinitely. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThis reliance also adds additional risks to the manufacturing process that are beyond our control. For example, the occurrence of epidemics or pandemics may cause one or more of our suppliers to close or reduce the scope of their operations either temporarily or permanently. In addition, these suppliers may provide components and products to our competitors. The medical device industrys reliance on a limited number of key components and product suppliers subjects us to the risk that in the event of an increase in demand, our suppliers may fail to provide supplies to us in a timely manner while they continue to supply our competitors, many of which have greater purchasing power than us, or seek to supply components to us at a higher cost.\nThe failure of our suppliers to deliver components or products in a timely fashion could have disruptive effects on our ability to produce our products in a timely manner, or we may be required to find new suppliers at an increased cost.\nMoreover, our reputation and the quality of our products are in part dependent on the quality of the components that we source from third-party suppliers. If we are unable to control the quality of the components supplied to us or to address known quality problems in a timely manner, then our reputation in the market may be damaged and sales of our products may suffer. As a result, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have limited insurance which may not cover claims by third parties against us or our officers and directors.\nWe have directors and officers liability insurance and commercial liability insurance policies. Claims, however, by third parties against us may exceed policy amounts and we may not have amounts to cover these claims. Any significant claims would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our limited directors and officers liability insurance may affect our ability to attract and retain directors and officers.\nOur inability to effectively protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively, our revenue, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. Creating and maintaining a strong patent portfolio is important to our business. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is complex and uncertain, so we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain or maintain patent rights, or that the patent rights we may obtain will be valuable, provide an effective barrier to competitors or otherwise provide competitive advantages. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions or demonstrate that we did not derive our invention from another, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or in court that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will prevail over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property rights may be subject to other challenges by third parties. Patents we obtain could be challenged in litigation or in administrative proceedings such as ex parte reexam, inter parties review, or post grant review in the United States or opposition proceedings in Europe or other jurisdictions.\nThere can be no assurance that:\n\u00b7\nany of our existing patents will continue to be held valid, if challenged;\n\u00b7\npatents will be issued for any of our pending applications;\n\u00b7\nany claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength to protect us;\n\u00b7\nour patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage; or\n\u00b7\nany of our products or technologies will not infringe on the patents of other companies.\nIf we are prevented from selling our products, or if we are required to develop new technologies or pay significant monetary damages or are required to make substantial royalty payments, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to pay royalties or incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non-infringing technology.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We may receive notices that claim we have infringed upon the intellectual property of others. Even if these claims are not valid, they could subject us to significant costs. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert our attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have not been engaged in litigation but litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. A successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or develop or license technology with comparable functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe analysis of our patent portfolio by PatSnap Research and ipCapital Group is not a legal analysis and does not predict the outcome of any legal challenges we or others might make in regard to patents, nor does it constitute a view on the overall legal strength of our patents.\nIf we are unable to secure a sales and marketing partner or establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities at our company, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technology.\nIf we are not successful entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements or recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our technology, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we must compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize technology without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u00b7\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestures that could result in final results that are different than expected.\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in discussions relating to possible acquisitions, equity investments, mergers, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. Such transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of debt on potentially unfavorable terms as well as impairment expenses related to goodwill and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, the possibility that we may pay too much cash or issue too many of our shares as the purchase price for an acquisition relative to the economic benefits that we ultimately derive from such acquisition, and various potential difficulties involved in integrating acquired businesses into our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have also engaged in discussions with candidates regarding the potential acquisitions of our product lines, technologies and businesses. If a divestiture such as this does occur, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain; reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business; and collect the proceeds from any divestitures.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition or divestiture transaction, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\nWe may make strategic acquisitions in the future, and if the acquired companies do not perform as expected, this could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and existing business.\nWe may continue to expand our business through strategic acquisitions. The success of any acquisition will depend on, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe availability of suitable candidates;\n\u00b7\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from other companies for the purchase of available candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to value those candidates accurately and negotiate favorable terms for those acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of funds to finance acquisitions and obtaining any consents necessary under our credit facility;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to establish new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the acquired businesses.\nWe may not be successful in effectively integrating acquired businesses and completing acquisitions in the future. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. Acquired businesses may fail to meet our performance expectations. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nGovernment regulatory approval may be necessary before some of our products can be sold and there is no assurance such approval will be granted.\nOur technology will have a number of potential applications in fields of use that will require prior governmental regulatory approval before the technology can be introduced to the marketplace. For example, we are exploring the use of our technology for certain medical diagnostic applications, with an initial focus on the monitoring of blood glucose. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing glucose monitoring medical applications for our technology. If we were to be successful in developing glucose monitoring medical applications of our technology, prior clearance by FDA and other governmental regulatory bodies will be required before the technology could be introduced into the marketplace. Our devices leverage Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process the massive data collected through the Bio-RFID sensor. ML/AI also controls the sensor operation, enabling the device to emit and capture data, and, ultimately, to identify and measure blood glucose levels. Machine learning-enabled device software functions (ML-DSF) continue to be evaluated by FDA, which recently released new guidance proposing a science-based approach for AI/ML-enabled medical devices to be modified and improved more quickly. There is no assurance that such regulatory approval would be obtained for a glucose monitoring medical diagnostic device or other applications requiring such approval. FDA can refuse to grant, delay, and limit or deny approval of an application for clearance of marketing a glucose monitoring device for many reasons. We may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances to market these glucose monitoring systems in the United States or outside of the United States. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approval or clearance for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability.\nWe or our manufacturers may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory clearances or approvals for our current or future products, or our distributors may be unable to obtain necessary qualifications, which could harm our business thus limited sales to the U.S.\nSales of our products internationally are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the U.S. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process, and marketing approval or clearance is not certain. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may rely on third-party distributors to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals required in other countries, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such clearances or approvals. Our distributors may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If our distributors experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the U.S., or if they fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, then we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products outside of the U.S., we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would be required to rely on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our product in foreign countries.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could result in the compromise of confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to customers, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business and operations.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures.\nThese threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to malfeasance by employees, consultants or other service providers to state-sponsored attacks. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom crafted against our information systems. Over the past several years, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employees, consultants or other service providers. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to deliver services to our customers. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our enterprise, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nAdditionally, the U.S. may institute additional cybersecurity requirements especially for medical devices. For example, the data security requirements in the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), enacted in December 2022, that among other provisions, requires developers of certain cyber devices to design and implement plans to monitor, identify and address cybersecurity vulnerabilities of those devices and to submit those plans to FDA as part of every new 510(k) or PMA for a cyber device. Cyber devices are defined as devices that include software, connect to the internet, and contain any technological features that could be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. This provision entered into effect on March 29, 2023, and FDA has indicated that it expects sponsors of cyber devices to begin to comply with these requirements as of October 1, 2023. FDA has stated that failure to comply with these requirements will result in FDA denying approval of the cyber device application.\nWe are subject to corporate governance and internal control requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our failure to comply with existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as additional rules and regulations currently in place and that may be subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. The financial cost of compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations is expected to remain substantial.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules, and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting, and similar matters in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and the value of our securities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, then our common stock would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American and the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE American is contingent on our continued compliance with a number of listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, our common stock would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders equity and a minimum number of public stockholders, as well as satisfy other listing requirements of the NYSE American. In addition to these objective standards, NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer for other reasons involving the judgment of NYSE American.\nWe have been informally advised by the staff of NYSE American that, given our current stockholders equity and history of net losses, we may be subject to the equity standards set forth in Section 1003(a)(ii) and (iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide, and that we may not satisfy these standards or the exemption criteria for these standards. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the NYSE American continued listing rules and/or continue its listing on the NYSE American in the future.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect the common stock would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u00b7\nsubstantially impair our ability to raise additional funds;\n\u00b7\nresult in a loss of institutional investor interest and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u00b7\na determination that our common stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\npotential breaches of representations or covenants of our agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements, which, regardless of merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile, which may cause investment losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely in the future to be volatile. Our common stock price may fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by us regarding liquidity, significant acquisitions, equity investments and divestitures, strategic relationships, addition or loss of significant customers and contracts, capital expenditure commitments and litigation;\n\u00b7\nIssuance of convertible or equity securities and related warrants for general or merger and acquisition purposes;\n\u00b7\nIssuance or repayment of debt, accounts payable or convertible debt for general or merger and acquisition purposes;\n\u00b7\nSale of a significant number of shares of our common stock by stockholders;\n\u00b7\nGeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nInvestor and public relation activities;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of technological innovations;\n\u00b7\nNew product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nCompetitive activities;\n\u00b7\nLow liquidity; and\n\u00b7\nAdditions or departures of key personnel.\nThese broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe sale of a significant number of our shares of common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had 80,358,463 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2023, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 14,506,158 shares of our common stock (including unearned stock option grants totaling 3,869,825 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 20,866,313 shares of our common stock, 8,108,356 shares of our common stock issuable, collectively, upon the conversion of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and approximately 3,040,219 shares of our common stock, collectively, reserved to pay accrued dividends on our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, we currently have 9,020,264 shares of our common stock at the current price of $0.25 per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures. Further, under the current terms of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and assuming no changes in the ownership thereof, going forward on a quarterly basis the Company will accrete as a preferred dividend the value of approximately 160,000 shares of common stock. Future accreted dividends will be settled by issuing additional shares of preferred stock which can then be converted to common stock. All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the September 30, 2023, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.\nSignificant shares of common stock are held by our principal stockholders, other company insiders and other large stockholders. As affiliates, as defined under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, our principal stockholders, other of our insiders and other large stockholders may only sell their shares of common stock in the public market pursuant to an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 144.\nThese options, warrants, convertible notes payable and convertible preferred stock could result in further dilution to common stockholders and may affect the market price of the common stock.\nFuture capital raises or other issuances of equity or debt securities may dilute our existing stockholders ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent that common stock is available for issuance, subject to compliance with applicable stock exchange listing rules, our board of directors has the ability to issue additional shares of common stock in the future for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient. The issuance of any additional shares could, among other things, result in substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of issuance, result in substantial dilution of our earnings per share and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nPursuant to our articles of incorporation, we are also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock of which 30,000 shares have been designated as our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and 20,000 shares have been designated as our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. Such preferred stock is senior to our common stock in terms of dividend priority and liquidation preference. Any preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation preference and may have greater voting rights than our common stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of our common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Although we have no present intention to designate or issue any shares of our authorized blank check preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nAs a result of the modifications of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (see Description of Securities-Preferred Stock), assuming no changes in the amount of outstanding Preferred Series C or D ownership, going forward on a quarterly basis the Company will accrete as a preferred dividend the value of approximately 160,000 shares of common stock. Future accreted dividends will be settled by issuing additional shares of preferred stock which can then be converted to common stock.\nIn the future, we may also attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities. These debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets.\nBecause our decision to issue securities or incur debt in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financing. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, you will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of your shares and diluting your interest in us.\nThe exercise prices of certain warrants, and the conversion prices of our outstanding convertible notes payable and our preferred stock may require further adjustment.\nIf in the future, we sell our common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to their respective certificates of designation. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 7,684,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,484,725 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.\nIf our company were to dissolve or wind-up operations, holders of our common stock would not receive a liquidation preference.\nIf we were to wind-up or dissolve our company and liquidate and distribute our assets, our common stockholders would share in our assets only after we satisfy any amounts we owe to our creditors and preferred equity holders. If our liquidation or dissolution were attributable to our inability to profitably operate our business, then it is likely that we would have material liabilities at the time of liquidation or dissolution. Accordingly, it is very unlikely that sufficient assets will remain available after the payment of our creditors and preferred equity holders to enable common stockholders to receive any liquidation distribution with respect to any common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNot applicable. ITEM 2.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nPART II  ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock began trading on NYSE American under the symbol KNW on September 16, 2022.\nNumber of Holders of our Common Shares\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were approximately 190 stockholders of record of our common stock. In computing the number of holders of record of our common stock, each broker-dealer and clearing corporation holding shares on behalf of its customers is counted as a single stockholder.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. We may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors subject to limitations under applicable law (including Nevada Revised Statutes 78.288) and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. See also Item 1A Risk Factors-Risks Related Ownership of Our Common Stock- We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nOur Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock do not accrue or pay cash dividends. All future dividends will be accrued and paid in Series C Convertible Preferred Stock or Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable. See Description of Securities-Preferred Stock.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nSee Item 12 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had the following sales of unregistered sales of equity securities:\nOn September 29, 2023, we closed an offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold 28,000,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $0.25 per share. After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $5,472,791.\nDescription of Securities\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe following description summarizes important terms of the classes of our capital stock as of September 30, 2023. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our articles of incorporation as amended, restated and supplemented to date, or our articles of incorporation, and our second amended and restated bylaws, or our bylaws, which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAuthorized Capital Stock. Our authorized capital stock currently consists of:\n\u00b7\n200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share; and\n\u00b7\n5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which:\n\u00b7\n30,000 shares have been designated as our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share; and\n\u00b7\n20,000 shares have been designated as our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share.\nIn August 2023, in connection with the Series C and D Convertible Preferred Stock 1 for 100 reverse stock split, the authorized shares of Series C and D Convertible Preferred stock were each reduced to 30,000 and 20,000, respectively.\nOutstanding Shares of Capital Stock. Our common stock is the only security of the Company registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All outstanding shares of our capital stock are fully paid and nonassessable. As of September 30, 2023, there were:\n\u00b7\n80,358,463 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held by holders of record;\n\u00b7\n17,858 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, held by one holder of record; and\n\u00b7\n10,161 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, held by one holder of record.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Our articles of incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nSubject to any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably those dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors on the common stock out of legally available funds. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock.\nHolders of common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock, including our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.\nPreferred Stock\nOur articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and to determine the designation, preferences, limitations and relative rights thereof, including, without limitation, such matters as dividends, redemption, liquidation, conversion and voting. Our board of directors has the discretion to issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock, or which could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.\nSeries C Convertible Preferred Stock\nOf our authorized preferred stock, 30,000 shares have been designated as our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series C Preferred Stock.\nWith respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution, shares of our Series C Preferred stock rank senior to our common stock and our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no preemptive or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Series C Preferred Stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of Series C Preferred Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any other series of preferred stock.\nIn addition to any class voting rights provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes or the certificate of designation for the Series C Preferred Stock, holders of Series C Preferred Stock have the right to vote, on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis (but subject to, and after giving effect to, the conversion limitations described below, applied effective as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote). Further, as long as any shares of Series C Preferred are outstanding, the Company shall not, among other things, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority on voting power of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock: (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series C Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Series C Preferred Stock certificate of designation, (b) issue any other class or series of capital stock ranking senior to or on parity the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or up liquidation or reclassify any shares of common stock or any series of capital stock into shares having preference or priority as to dividends or upon liquidation superior to or on parity with any such preference or priority of Series C Preferred Stock, or (c) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.\nEach outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends at a rate equal to 8.0% per annum of the Series C Preferred Stock stated value (currently $70.00, subject to adjustment as provided in the Series C Preferred Stock certificate of designation). Dividends, whether accrued, declared or payable are payable solely in the form of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock and shall not in any circumstances be accrued or payable in cash. Such dividends are payable only upon conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, or when, as and if otherwise declared by our board of directors.\nEach holder of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock has the right, at its option at any time, to convert such holders shares of Series C Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock certificate of designation. Further, we may also require, upon notice, the conversion of any or all shares of the Series C Preferred Stock into our common stock provided that the shares issuable upon such conversion meet certain resale eligibility requirements, and our common stock has been approved for listing on specified stock exchanges, all as set forth in the Series C Preferred Stock certificate of designation. However, we shall not effect a conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, whether voluntary or mandatory, and the holder of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall not have the right to voluntarily convert such holders shares of Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such holder (together with such holders affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. By written notice to the Corporation, a holder may from time to time increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not less than 4.99% and not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that any such increase or decrease will only be effective for that holder and will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to us.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock also has price-based, full-ratchet, and proportional anti-dilution rights, based on issuance or deemed issuances of our securities below the current conversion price of $0.25 per share, all as set forth in the Series C Preferred Stock certificate of designation.\nSeries D Convertible Preferred Stock\nOf our authorized preferred stock, 20,000 shares have been designated as our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series D Preferred Stock. With respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution, shares of our Series D Preferred Stock rank senior to our common stock but junior to our Series C Preferred Stock. Holders of Series D Preferred Stock have no preemptive or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Series D Preferred Stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any other series of preferred stock.\nIn addition to any class voting rights provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes or the certificate of designation for the Series D Preferred Stock, holders of Series D Preferred Stock have the right to vote, on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis (but subject to, and after giving effect to, the conversion limitations described below, applied effective as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote). Further, as long as any shares of Series D Preferred are outstanding, the Company shall not, among other things, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority on voting power of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock: (a) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series D Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Series D Preferred Stock certificate of designation, (b) issue any other class or series of capital stock ranking senior to or on parity the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or up liquidation or reclassify any shares of common stock or any series of capital stock into shares having preference or priority as to dividends or upon liquidation superior to or on parity with any such preference or priority of Series D Preferred Stock, or (c) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.\nEach outstanding share of Series D Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends at a rate equal to 8.0% per annum of the Series D Preferred Stock stated value (currently $70.00, subject to adjustment as provided in the Series D Preferred Stock certificate of designation). Dividends, whether accrued, declared or payable are payable solely in the form of additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock and shall not in any circumstances be accrued or payable in cash. Such dividends are payable only upon conversion of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock, or when, as and if otherwise declared by our board of directors.\nEach holder of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock has the right, at its option at any time, to convert such holders shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock certificate of designation. Further, we may also require, upon notice, the conversion of any or all shares of the Series D Preferred Stock into our common stock provided that the shares issuable upon such conversion meet certain resale eligibility requirements, and our common stock has been approved for listing on specified stock exchanges, all as set forth in the Series D Preferred Stock certificate of designation. However, we shall not effect a conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock, whether voluntary or mandatory, and the holder of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall not have the right to voluntarily convert such holders shares of Series D Preferred Stock, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such holder (together with such holders affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. By written notice to the Corporation, a holder may from time to time increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not less than 4.99% and not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that any such increase or decrease will only be effective for that holder and will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to us.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock also has price-based, full-ratchet, and proportional anti-dilution rights, based on issuance or deemed issuances of our securities below the current conversion price of $0.25 per share, all as set forth in the Series D Preferred Stock certificate of designation.\nEquity Incentive Plan\nAs of September 30, 2023, we have issued stock options for the purchase of 14,506,158 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $1.546. The expiration dates of these stock options range from now to May 30, 2028. There are unearned stock option grants totaling 3,869,825 shares related to performance targets.\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock\nAs of September 30, 2023, we have issued warrants for the purchase of 20,866,313 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.063. The expiration dates of these warrants range from January 30, 2024 to September 26, 2028.\nIf in the future, we sell our common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to their respective certificates of designation. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 7,684,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,484,725 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.\nClayton A. Struve has warrants to purchase 6,269,715 shares of common stock that have a beneficial ownership blocker at 4.99%.\nThe proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, to the extent not exercised on a cashless basis, may generate potential proceeds. We cannot provide assurance that any of these warrants will be exercised.\nConvertible Promissory Notes\nWe owe Clayton A. Struve, a significant stockholder, $1,301,005 under convertible promissory or OID notes. We recorded accrued interest of $94,062 and $86,562 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On December 7, 2022, we signed Amendments to the convertible promissory or OID notes, extending the due dates to September 30, 2023. On September 15, 2023, the due dates on the notes was further extended to September 30, 2024. For accounting purposes only, the September 15, 2023 extension required us to increase the value of the convertible note by approximately $230,000 and record a corresponding loss on debt extinguishment because the extension of terms results in a de facto debt extinguishment but does not change our cash obligation required to settle the note.\nWe owe Ronald P. Erickson and J3E2A2Z LP, (J3E2A2Z) an entity affiliated with and controlled by Ronald P. Erickson $1,460,926 under convertible promissory notes On March 16, 2018, we entered into a Note and Account Payable Conversion Agreement pursuant to which (a) all $664,233 currently owing under the J3E2A2Z Notes was converted to a Convertible Redeemable Promissory Note in the principal amount of $664,233, and (b) all $519,833 of the J3E2A2Z Account Payable was converted into a Convertible Redeemable Promissory Note in the principal amount of $519,833 together with a warrant to purchase up to 1,039,666 shares of common stock of our for a period of five years. The initial exercise price of the warrants described above is $0.50 per share, also subject to certain adjustments. We recorded accrued interest of $218,334 and $287,290 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On December 7, 2022, we approved Amendments to the convertible redeemable promissory notes with Ronald P. Erickson and J3E2A2Z, extending the due dates to January 30, 2023. On January 25, 2023, we approved Amendments to the convertible redeemable promissory notes with Ronald P. Erickson and J3E2A2Z, extending the due dates to September 30, 2023. On September 15, 2023, the due dates on the notes was further extended to September 30, 2024. For accounting purposes only, the September 15, 2023 extension required us to increase the value of the convertible note by approximately $277,000 and record a corresponding loss on debt extinguishment because the extension of terms results in a de facto debt extinguishment but does not change our cash obligation required to settle the note.\nSecurities Subject to Price Adjustments\nIf in the future, we sell our common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of our outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to their respective certificates of designation. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 7,684,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,424,425 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.\nAnti-takeover Provisions\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Nevada Law and our Governing Documents\nProvisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third-party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition could benefit our stockholders. Such provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws can have the effect of enhancing continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and the policies formulated by the board of directors, and can also have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control of our company. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for a takeover that does not contemplate the acquisition of all of our outstanding shares, or an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or part of our company.\nNevada Anti-Takeover Statutes\nThe Nevada Revised Statutes, or NRS, contain provisions governing the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations. Nevadas acquisition of controlling interest statutes (NRS 78.378 through 78.3793, inclusive) contain provisions governing the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations. These control share laws provide generally that any person that acquires a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations may be denied voting rights, unless a majority of the disinterested stockholders of the corporation elects to restore such voting rights. These laws will apply to us as of a particular date if we were to have 200 or more stockholders of record (at least 100 of whom have addresses in Nevada appearing on our stock ledger at all times during the 90 days immediately preceding that date) and do business in the State of Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation, unless our articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on the tenth day after the acquisition of a controlling interest provide otherwise. These laws provide that a person acquires a controlling interest whenever a person acquires shares of a subject corporation that, but for the application of these provisions of the NRS, would enable that person to exercise (1) one-fifth or more, but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more, but less than a majority or (3) a majority or more, of all of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors. Once an acquirer crosses one of these thresholds, shares which it acquired in the transaction taking it over the threshold and within the 90 days immediately preceding the date when the acquiring person acquired or offered to acquire a controlling interest become control shares to which the voting restrictions described above apply. These laws may have a chilling effect on certain transactions if our articles of incorporation or bylaws are not amended to provide that these provisions do not apply to us or to an acquisition of a controlling interest, or if our disinterested stockholders do not confer voting rights in the control shares.\nNevadas combinations with interested stockholders statutes (NRS 78.411 through 78.444, inclusive) provide that specified types of business combinations between certain Nevada corporations and any person deemed to be an interested stockholder of the corporation are prohibited for two years after such person first becomes an interested stockholder unless the corporations board of directors approves the combination (or the transaction by which such person becomes an interested stockholder) in advance, or unless the combination is approved by the board of directors and sixty percent of the corporations voting power not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder, its affiliates and associates. Furthermore, in the absence of prior approval certain restrictions may apply even after such two-year period. For purposes of these statutes, an interested stockholder is any person who is (1) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (2) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term combination is sufficiently broad to cover most significant transactions between a corporation and an interested stockholder. These laws generally apply to Nevada corporations with 200 or more stockholders of record. However, a Nevada corporation may elect in its articles of incorporation not to be governed by these particular laws, but if such election is not made in the corporations original articles of incorporation, the amendment (1) must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock representing a majority of the outstanding voting power of the corporation not beneficially owned by interested stockholders or their affiliates and associates, and (2) is not effective until 18 months after the vote approving the amendment and does not apply to any combination with a person who first became an interested stockholder on or before the effective date of the amendment. Neither our original articles of incorporation nor our current articles of incorporation include such an election.\nNRS 78.139 also provides that directors may resist a change or potential change in control of the corporation if the board of directors determines that the change or potential change is opposed to or not in the best interest of the corporation upon consideration of any relevant facts, circumstances, contingencies or constituencies pursuant to NRS 78.138(4). The Nevada Revised Statutes also provide that any director may be removed from our board of directors by the vote or written consent of stockholders representing not less than two-thirds of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote, and this standard is also reflected in our bylaws.\nBylaws\nOur bylaws contain limitations as to who may call special meetings and also establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares\nOur authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval. We may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public or private offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock could render it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or other transaction. Our authorized but unissued shares may be used to delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nMarket Price of and Dividends on Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\nOur common stock trades on the NYSE American under the symbol KNW. Trades in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, broker/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction before the sale.\nPeriod Ended\nHigh\nLow\nYear Ending September 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, 2023\n$ 1.17\n$ 0.23\nJune 30, 2023\n$ 1.39\n$ 0.80\nMarch 31, 2023\n$ 1.59\n$ 0.80\nDecember 31, 2022\n$ 2.02\n$ 0.92\nYear Ending September 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2022\n$ 3.44\n$ 1.85\nJune 30, 2022\n$ 2.71\n$ 1.36\nMarch 31, 2022\n$ 2.19\n$ 1.22\nDecember 31, 2021\n$ 2.60\n$ 1.48\nAs of December 15, 2023, the high and low sales price of our common stock was $0.94 per share and $0.8375 per share, respectively. As of December 15, 2023, we had 81,346,524 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held by 190 stockholders of record. This number does not include approximately 5,690 beneficial owners whose shares are held in the names of various security brokers, dealers and registered clearing agencies.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nWe have appointed Equiniti Trust Company located at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, telephone number (800) 937-5449, as the transfer agent for our common stock. ITEM 6.\nSummary Financial Information\nIn the following table, we provide you with our selected consolidated historical financial and other data. We have prepared the consolidated selected financial information using our consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2023 through September 30, 2022. When you read this selected consolidated historical financial and other data, it is important that you read along with it the historical financial statements and related notes in our consolidated financial statements included in this report and prior 10-K filings, as well as ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the sections titled Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nOverview\nWe are focused on the development and commercialization of our proprietary sensor technology utilizing radio and microwave spectroscopy. When paired with our machine learning platform, our technology is capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify, and measure the unique signature of said materials or analytes. The first application of our sensor technology is in a product to non-invasively monitor blood glucose levels. This device will require US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance before entering the market.\nOn April 30, 2020, we incorporated our wholly owned subsidiary, Particle, Inc. Particle was focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena, which remains our companys singular focus. Since incorporation, Particle was engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. Particle is now looking for partners to take this product to market.\nOn September 17, 2021, we incorporated our wholly owned subsidiary, AI Mind, Inc., for the purpose of identifying and capitalizing on market opportunities for our AI deep learning platform (discussed below). The first activity undertaken by AI Mind was the creation of graphical images expressed as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, utilizing the AI deep learning platform. During the year ended September 30, 2022, AI Mind, operating our AI deep learning platform, began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $4,360,000. AI Mind was dissolved on July 25, 2023.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 23, 2023, Phillip A. Bosua resigned from the Board of Directors and from his position as our Chief Executive Officer.\nOn January 23, 2023, our Board of Directors appointed Ronald P. Erickson, the current Chairman of the Board, to the position of Chief Executive Officer.\nOn January 27, 2023, we announced the following new officers/transitions: Leo Trautwein, Chief Commercial Officer, and Jessica English, Chief Marketing Officer.\nOn April 21, 2023, we announced the publication of a peer-reviewed study in Sensors Journal. The manuscript described the proof-of-principle study of Bio-RFID technology that quantified three different analytes in vitro. In the peer-reviewed publication, it was found Bio-RFID achieved 100% accuracy in quantifying these three different analytes in vitro. This study was conducted in collaboration with Mayo Clinic.\nOn May 5, 2023, we announced the results of a technical feasibility study that was presented at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Annual Meeting. The study demonstrated that the Bio-RFID sensor can deliver stable, repeatable results in predicting blood glucose concentrations obtained by a reference device.\nOn June 7, 2023, we revealed the portable Generation 1 prototype for non-invasive glucose monitoring. The Generation 1 prototype is a portable research lab, designed to be a powerful data collection device. This device should allow Know Labs to scale data collection, including testing across more diverse participant populations and scenarios.\nIn June of 2023, the Company issued 1,402,784 share of common stock as dividends to the holder of Series D Convertible Preferred stock as settlement of cumulative unpaid dividends through December 2022.\nOn July 26, 2023, we announced the completion of a new study demonstrating that continued algorithm refinement and more high-quality data improved the accuracy of the Bio-RFID sensor technology, resulting in an overall Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 11.27%.\nOn August 9, 2023, the Board authorized the Company to file a series of amendments to the certificates of designation for certain series of our preferred stock, and the restatement of its articles of incorporation, as described below, each of which were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State effective August 11, 2023. Based upon the June 2023 issuance of common stock dividends to Series D Convertible Preferred Stock holder and the modified terms and conditions of Series C and D certificates of designation, it was determined that Series C and D preferred dividends need to be accreted for the cumulative unpaid dividends . As of September 30, 2023, cumulative unpaid Series C and D totaled approximately $770,000 which converts to approximately 3,040,0000 shares of common stock. The value of the 3.0 million shares of common totaled $3,526,653. The Company recorded $3,526,653 in cumulative deemed dividends related to Series C and D Preferred Stock which have not been paid.\nIn connection with the amendment and restatement of our preferred stock, we effected a reverse split of our outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock by a factor of 1-for-100. No changes were made to the 5 million total shares of blank-check preferred stock authorized in our Articles. Prior to such reverse split, there were 1,785,715 and 1,016,004 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock designated and outstanding, respectively. To account for the reverse split, but in order to provide the ability to issue pay in kind dividends in lieu of cash dividends, at the time of the reverse split, we designated 30,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and 20,000 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, of which 17,858 and 10,161 shares were, respectively, outstanding immediately after such reverse split. In order to maintain the economic rights of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, the definition of Stated Value was multiplied by 100, to offset the reverse split factor.\nOn September 15, 2023, we signed amendments to the convertible promissory or OID notes, held by Clayton A. Struve and Ron Erickson, to extend the due dates to September 30, 2024.\nOn September 29, 2023, we closed an offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold 28,000,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $0.25 per share via an S-1 registration statement. After deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses, we received net proceeds of $5,472,791.As part of the offering, the Company issued common stock purchase warrants to the Underwriter Representatives to purchase an aggregate of 1,960,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, subject to adjustments. The Representatives Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, until September 26, 2028 and may be exercised on a cashless basis.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance\nOur operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our research and development team to produce an FDA clearance quality technology;\n\u00b7\nour ability to recruit and maintain quality personnel with the talent to bring our technology to the market;\n\u00b7\nthe production of market ready products that can sustain FDA clearance quality results;\n\u00b7\nthe clearance by FDA after their rigorous clinical trial process of our products for the marketplace;\n\u00b7\nthe receptivity of the marketplace and the addressable diabetes community to our new non-invasive glucose monitoring technology; and\n\u00b7\naccess to sufficient capital to support us until our products achieve FDA clearance and are accepted in the marketplace.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires that an enterprise report selected information about reportable segments in its financial reports issued to its stockholders. The Company considers the business to currently have one operating segment: the development of its radio frequency spectroscopy technology with a first focus on non-invasively ascertaining blood glucose levels. Previous segments included (i) Particle, Inc. technology; and (ii) AI Mind, Inc. sales of NFT products. Particle commenced operations in the year ended September 30, 2020. It is now looking for partners to take the product to market. AI Mind commenced operations during the year ended September 30, 2022. AI Mind was dissolved on July 25, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nYears Ended September 30,\n$ Variance\n% Variance\nRevenue- digital asset sales\n$ -\n$ 4,360\n$ (4,360 )\n-100.0 %\nOperating expenses-\nResearch and development and operating expenses-\nResearch and development expenses\n7,727\n5,386\n(2,341 )\n-43.5 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n6,571\n8,118\n1,547\n19.1 %\nSelling and transactional costs for digital assets\n(274 )\n3,430\n3,704\n108.0 %\nTotal operating erxpenses\n14,024\n16,934\n2,910\n17.2 %\nOperating loss\n(14,024 )\n(12,574 )\n(1,450 )\n-11.5 %\nOther expense:\nInterest income\n746.7 %\nInterest expense\n(390 )\n(8,034 )\n7,644\n95.1 %\nLoss on debt extinguishment\n(507 )\n-\n(507 )\n-100.0 %\nOther (expense) income\n(495 )\n(1,017 )\n-194.8 %\nTotal other (expense), net\n(1,265 )\n(7,497 )\n6,232\n83.1 %\nLoss before income taxes\n(15,289 )\n(20,071 )\n4,782\n23.8 %\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\n-\n0.0 %\nNet loss\n$ (15,289 )\n$ (20,071 )\n$ 4,782\n23.8 %\nRevenues. Revenue- digital asset sales for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $0 as compared to $4,360,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. We do not expect future activity or revenue from that source. Our Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning platform has generated revenue- digital asset sales of $4,360,000 from Non-Fungible Token (NFT) sales.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased $2,341,000 to $7,727,000 as compared to $5,386,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due to increased personnel, use of consultants, expenditures related to the development of our radio frequency spectroscopy Bio-RFID\u2122 technology. During the end of the three months ended June 30, 2023, we reduced our headcount by nine and operating expenses and used external consultants to reduce the future cost of the development of our Bio-RFID\u2122 technology.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased $1,547,000 to $6,571,000 as compared to $8,118,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease primarily was due to (i) a decrease of $1,466,000 in stock based compensation; (ii) a decrease in compensation expense of $451,000 related to warrants issued for services; (iii) a decrease in common stock issued for services of $183,000; offset by (iv) an increase in insurance of $420,000; and (v) an increase in other expenses of $133,000. As part of the selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $305,000 and $380,000, respectively, of investor relationship and business development expenses.\nSelling and Transactional Costs for Digital Asset Sales. Selling and transactional for digital asset sales were ($274,000) as compared $3,430,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. During 2022, our Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning platform has generated revenue- digital asset sales of $4,360,000 from Non-Fungible Token (NFT) sales. The benefit for the year ended September 30, 2023 included an adjustment of our estimate for sales and use tax related to the sale of digital assets. Such costs for the year ended September 30, 2022 included digital asset conversion loss, consulting, bonus compensation transaction fees, taxes, royalties and other costs.\nOther (Expense), Net. Other expense, net for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $1,265,000 as compared to other expense, net of $7,497,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The other expense, net for the year ended September 30, 2023 included (i) interest income of $127,000; offset by (ii) interest expense of $390,000 related to convertible notes payable and the modification and extension of terms; (iii) loss on debt extinguishment of $507,000 related to the extension of convertible notes payable; and (iv) other expense of $495,000 related to the write-off of certain equipment. .\nThe other expense, net for the year ended September 30, 2022 included (i) interest expense of $8,034,000 related to convertible notes payable and the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature and value of warrants issued; and offset by (ii) other income of $522,000 primarily related to the forgiveness of notes payable- PPP loans and other debt and (iii) interest income of $15,000.\nNet Loss. Net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $15,289,000 as compared to $20,071,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 included non-cash expenses of $4,768,000. The non-cash items include (i) depreciation and amortization of $313,000; (ii) loss on sale of assets of $550,000; (iii) loss on debt extinguishment of $507,000; (iv) modification of notes and warrants- interest expense of $350,000; (v) stock based compensation- stock options of $2,956,000; and (vi) amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $142,000.\nThe net loss for the year ended September 30, 2022 included non-cash expenses of $12,164,000.

Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.\nWe have cash and cash equivalents of $8,024,000 and net working capital of approximately $6,264,000 (exclusive of convertible notes payable) as of September 30, 2023. We anticipate that we will record losses from operations for the foreseeable future.

None of the expenditures are contractual obligations as of September 30, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates\nThe following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our Company which involve significant estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from managements current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition. We determine revenue recognition from contracts with customers through the following steps:\n\u00b7\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n\u00b7\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u00b7\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7\nrecognition of the revenue when, or as our company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we generated revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs. Our engineering team, using its research data, AI and proprietary algorithms, produced NFTs in the form of digital art. The NFTs produced had no recorded cost basis. The Company does not expect future activity or revenue from that source.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist of the cost of officers, employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entitys own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and.\nLevel 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.\nWe have a money market account which is considered a level 1 asset. The balance as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $7,836,393 and $11,821,931, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. Pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, we evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. We then determine if embedded derivative must be bifurcated and separately accounted for. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date. We determined that the conversion features for purposes of bifurcation within convertible notes payable issued during 2020 and 2021 were immaterial and as of September 30, 2023 all such convertible notes have been converted to common stock.\nStock Based Compensation. We have share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by us at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. For options issued to employees, we recognize stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.\nConvertible Securities. Based upon ASC 815-15, we have adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities to determine if an instrument should be accounted for as equity or a liability. We will evaluate our contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nThe full text of our audited consolidated financial statements begins on page of this annual report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\na) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded as of September 30, 2023 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nPursuant to Regulation S-K Item 308(b), this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost.\nc) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, which were identified in connection with our managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting.

Officers serve at the discretion of the Board.\nFamily Relationships\nThere are no family relationships among any of our officers or directors.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, except as described below, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:\n\u00b7\nbeen convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences);\n\u00b7\nhad any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time;\n\u00b7\nbeen subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity;\n\u00b7\nbeen found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;\n\u00b7\nbeen the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n\u00b7\nbeen the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.\nCorporate Governance\nThe Boards Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board oversees that the assets of our company are properly safeguarded, that the appropriate financial and other controls are maintained, and that our business is conducted wisely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance. Included in these responsibilities is the Boards oversight of the various risks facing our company. In this regard, our Board seeks to understand and oversee critical business risks. Our Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of our business strategy. Our Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for our company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve our objectives.\nWhile the Board oversees risk management, company management is charged with managing risk. Management communicates routinely with the Board and individual directors on the significant risks identified and how they are being managed. Directors are free to, and indeed often do, communicate directly with senior management.\nOur Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole by making risk oversight a matter of collective consideration; however, much of the work is delegated to committees, which will meet regularly and report back to the full Board. The audit committee oversees risks related to our financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting and legal matters, the compensation committee evaluates the risks and rewards associated with our compensation philosophy and programs, and the nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates risks associated with management decisions and strategic direction.\nAttendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders\nWe expect that all of our Board members will attend our annual meetings of stockholders in the absence of a showing of good cause for failure to do so and all attended our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders in person or by telephone.\nBoard Meetings and Committees\nDuring our last fiscal year, each of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of Board meetings and (ii) the total number of meetings of the committees on which the director served.\nIndependent Directors\nNYSE Americans rules generally require that a majority of an issuers board of directors must consist of independent directors. Our board of directors currently consists of seven (7) directors, six (6) of whom, Messrs. Owens, Pepper, Takesako, Cronin, Londergan, and Ellingson, are independent within the meaning of NYSE American rules.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur Board has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each with its own charter approved by the Board. Each committees charter is available on our website at www.knowlabs.co. In addition, our Board may, from time to time, designate one or more additional committees, which shall have the duties and powers granted to it by our Board.\nAudit Committee\nWilliam A. Owens, Jon Pepper and Tim Londergan, each of whom satisfies the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and NYSE Americans rules, serve on our audit committee, with Mr. Pepper serving as the chairman. Our Board has determined that Mr. Owens qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined by applicable SEC rules. The audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of the Company.\nThe audit committee is responsible for, among other things: (i) retaining and overseeing our independent accountants; (ii) assisting the Board in its oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditors and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) reviewing and approving the plan and scope of the internal and external audit; (iv) pre-approving any audit and non-audit services provided by our independent auditors; (v) approving the fees to be paid to our independent auditors; (vi) reviewing with our chief executive officer and principal financial officer and independent auditors the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls; (vii) reviewing hedging transactions; and (viii) reviewing and assessing annually the audit committees performance and the adequacy of its charter. The audit committee is also responsible for preparing a report to be included with this Proxy Statement. Our audit committee met 4 times during the last fiscal year.\nCompensation Committee\nWilliam A. Owens, John Cronin and Jon Pepper, each of whom satisfies the independence requirements of Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and NYSE Americans rules, serve on our compensation committee, with Mr. Owens serving as the chairman. The members of the compensation committee are also non-employee directors within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The compensation committee assists the Board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers.\nThe compensation committee is responsible for, among other things: (i) reviewing and approving the remuneration of our executive officers; (ii) making recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of our independent directors; (iii) making recommendations to the Board regarding equity-based and incentive compensation plans, policies and programs; and (iv) reviewing and assessing annually the compensation committees performance and the adequacy of its charter. Our compensation committee met 4 times during the last fiscal year.\nNo member of our compensation committee is or has been our current or former officer or employee. None of our executive officers served as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director or member of our compensation committee during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nLarry K. Ellingson, Jon Pepper and Ichiro Takesako, each of whom satisfies the independence requirements of NYSE Americans rules, serve on our nominating and corporate governance committee, with Mr. Ellingson serving as the chairman. The nominating and corporate governance committee assists the Board in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the Board and its committees.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things: (i) identifying and evaluating individuals qualified to become members of the Board by reviewing nominees for election to the Board submitted by stockholders and recommending to the Board director nominees for each annual meeting of stockholders and for election to fill any vacancies on the Board; (ii) advising the Board with respect to Board organization, desired qualifications of Board members, the membership, function, operation, structure and composition of committees (including any committee authority to delegate to subcommittees), and self-evaluation and policies; (iii) advising on matters relating to corporate governance and monitoring developments in the law and practice of corporate governance; (iv) overseeing compliance with our code of ethics; and (v) approving any related party transactions.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committees methods for identifying candidates for election to our Board (other than those proposed by our stockholders, as discussed below) include the solicitation of ideas for possible candidates from a number of sources - members of our Board, our executives, individuals personally known to the members of our Board, and other research. The nominating and corporate governance committee may also, from time-to-time, retain one or more third-party search firms to identify suitable candidates.\nIn making director recommendations, the nominating and corporate governance committee may consider some or all of the following factors: (i) the candidates judgment, skill, and experience with other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity and size, and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight; (ii) the interplay of the candidates experience with the experience of other Board members; (iii) the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any committee thereof; (iv) whether or not the person has any relationships that might impair his or her independence; and (v) the candidates ability to contribute to the effective management of the Company, taking into account the needs of the Company and such factors as the individuals experience, perspective, skills and knowledge of the industry in which we operate.\nA stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as a director at an annual meeting of stockholders if the stockholder complies with the notice and information provisions contained in our Bylaws. Such notice must be received in writing to our Company not later than the close of business fourteen (14) days nor earlier than the close of business eighty (80) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that if less than twenty-one (21) days notice of the meeting is given to stockholders, such writing shall be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the close of the seventh (7th) day following the day on which notice of the meeting was mailed to stockholders. In addition, stockholders furnishing such notice must be a holder of record on both (i) the date of delivering such notice and (ii) the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.

The following summary briefly describes the principal features of the 2021 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2021 Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to this report.\nAwards that may be granted include: (a) incentive stock options, (b) non-qualified stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights, (d) restricted awards, (e) performance share awards, and (f) performance compensation awards. These awards offer our officers, employees, consultants and directors the possibility of future value, depending on the long-term price appreciation of our common stock and the award holders continuing service with our company. All of the permissible types of awards under the 2021 Plan are described in more detail below.\nPurposes of 2021 Plan: The purposes of the 2021 Plan are to attract and retain officers, employees and directors for our company and our subsidiaries; motivate them by means of appropriate incentives to achieve long-range goals; provide incentive compensation opportunities; and further align their interests with those of our stockholders through compensation that is based on our common stock.\nAdministration of the 2021 Plan: The 2021 Plan is administered by our compensation committee (which we refer to as the plan administrator). Among other things, the plan administrator has the authority to select persons who will receive awards, determine the types of awards and the number of shares to be covered by awards, and to establish the terms, conditions, performance criteria, restrictions and other provisions of awards. The plan administrator has authority to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2021 Plan.\nEligible Recipients: Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan will be those officers, employees, consultants, and directors of our company and our subsidiaries who are selected by the plan administrator.\nShares Available Under the 2021 Plan: 20,000,000 shares of our common stock were originally authorized as the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be delivered to participants under the 2021 Plan, subject to adjustment for certain corporate changes affecting the shares, such as stock splits. This number was increased to 22,000,000 shares of common stock as of January 1, 2022 as a result of the automatic share reserve increase discussed below. Shares subject to an award under the 2021 Plan for which the award is canceled, forfeited or expires again become available for grants under the 2021 Plan. Shares subject to an award that is settled in cash will not again be made available for grants under the 2021 Plan. As of the date of this report, all shares remain available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan also authorizes for issuance the sum of (A) any shares of our common stock that, as of the date of stockholder approval of the 2021 Plan, have been reserved but not issued pursuant to any awards granted under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and (B) any shares of our common stock subject to stock options or similar awards granted under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan that, after the date of stockholder approval of the 2021 Plan, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares of our common stock issued pursuant to awards granted under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan that are forfeited to or repurchased by us, with the maximum number of shares of our common stock to be added to the 2021 Plan pursuant to clause (B) equal to 7,592,825.\nAutomatic Share Reserve Increase: Subject to the provisions of Section 14 of the 2021 Plan, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan will be increased on the first day of each calendar year beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2030 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 2,000,000 shares of our common stock, (ii) four percent (4%) of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (iii) such number of shares of our common stock determined by our board of directors; provided, that such determination under clause (iii) will be made no later than the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year.\nStock Options: Stock options give the option holder the right to acquire from us a designated number of shares of common stock at a purchase price that is fixed upon the grant of the option. The exercise price will not be less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted may be either tax-qualified stock options (so-called incentive stock options) or non-qualified stock options.\nGeneral. Subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan, the plan administrator has the authority to determine all grants of stock options. That determination will include: (i) the number of shares subject to any option; (ii) the exercise price per share; (iii) the expiration date of the option; (iv) the manner, time and date of permitted exercise; (v) other restrictions, if any, on the option or the shares underlying the option; and (vi) any other terms and conditions as the plan administrator may determine.\nOption Price. The exercise price for stock options will be determined at the time of grant. Normally, the exercise price will not be less than the fair market value on the date of grant. As a matter of tax law, the exercise price for any incentive stock option awarded may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. However, incentive stock option grants to any person owning more than 10% of our voting stock must have an exercise price of not less than 110% of the fair market value on the grant date.\nExercise of Options. An option may be exercised only in accordance with the terms and conditions for the option agreement as established by the plan administrator at the time of the grant. The option must be exercised by notice to us, accompanied by payment of the exercise price. Payments may be made in cash or, at the option of the plan administrator, by actual or constructive delivery of shares of common stock to the holder of the option based upon the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise.\nExpiration or Termination. Options, if not previously exercised, will expire on the expiration date established by the plan administrator at the time of grant. In the case of incentive stock options, such term cannot exceed ten years provided that in the case of holders of more than 10% of our voting stock, such term cannot exceed five years. Options will terminate before their expiration date if the holders service with our company or a subsidiary terminates before the expiration date. The option may remain exercisable for specified periods after certain terminations of employment, including terminations as a result of death, disability or retirement, with the precise period during which the option may be exercised to be established by the plan administrator and reflected in the grant evidencing the award.\nIncentive and Non-Qualified Options. As described elsewhere in this summary, an incentive stock option is an option that is intended to qualify under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for more favorable tax treatment than applies to non-qualified stock options. Any option that does not qualify as an incentive stock option will be a non-qualified stock option. Under the Code, certain restrictions apply to incentive stock options. For example, the exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the grant date and the term of the option may not exceed ten years. In addition, an incentive stock option may not be transferred, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the holders lifetime only by the holder. In addition, no incentive stock options may be granted to a holder that is first exercisable in a single year if that option, together with all incentive stock options previously granted to the holder that also first become exercisable in that year, relate to shares having an aggregate market value in excess of $100,000, measured at the grant date.\nStock Appreciation Rights: Stock appreciation rights, or SARs, which may be granted alone or in tandem with options, have an economic value similar to that of options. When a SAR for a particular number of shares is exercised, the holder receives a payment equal to the difference between the market price of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the shares under the SAR. The exercise price for SARs normally is the market price of the shares on the date the SAR is granted. Under the 2021 Plan, holders of SARs may receive this payment - the appreciation value - either in cash or shares of common stock valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise. The form of payment will be determined by us.\nStock Awards: Restricted shares are shares of common stock awarded to participants at no cost. Restricted shares can take the form of awards of restricted stock, which represent issued and outstanding shares of our common stock subject to vesting criteria, or restricted stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock, subject to satisfaction of the vesting criteria. Those may include requirements for continuous service and/or the achievement of specified performance goals. Restricted shares are forfeitable and non-transferable until the shares vest. The vesting date or dates and other conditions for vesting are established when the shares are awarded.\nCash Awards: A cash award is an award that may be in the form of cash or shares of common stock or a combination, based on the attainment of pre-established performance goals and other conditions, restrictions and contingencies identified by the plan administrator.\nSection 162(m) of the Code: Section 162(m) of the Code limits publicly-held companies to an annual deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $1.0 million for compensation paid to each of their principal executive officer or principal financial officer and their three highest compensated executive officers (other than the principal executive officer or principal financial officer) determined at the end of each year, referred to as covered employees.\nPerformance Criteria: Under the 2021 Plan, one or more performance criteria will be used by the plan administrator in establishing performance goals. Any one or more of the performance criteria may be used on an absolute or relative basis to measure the performance of our company, as the plan administrator may deem appropriate, or as compared to the performance of a group of comparable companies or published or special index that the plan administrator deems appropriate. In determining the actual size of an individual performance compensation award, the plan administrator may reduce or eliminate the amount of the award through the use of negative discretion if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate. The plan administrator shall not have the discretion to (i) grant or provide payment in respect of performance compensation awards if the performance goals have not been attained or (ii) increase a performance compensation award above the maximum amount payable under the 2021 Plan.\nOther Material Provisions: Awards will be evidenced by a written agreement, in such form as may be approved by the plan administrator. In the event of various changes to the capitalization of our company, such as stock splits, stock dividends and similar re-capitalizations, an appropriate adjustment will be made by the plan administrator to the number of shares covered by outstanding awards or to the exercise price of such awards. The plan administrator is also permitted to include in the written agreement provisions that provide for certain changes in the award in the event of a change of control of our company, including acceleration of vesting. Except as otherwise determined by the plan administrator at the date of grant, awards will not be transferable, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Prior to any award distribution, we are permitted to deduct or withhold amounts sufficient to satisfy any employee withholding tax requirements. Our board also has the authority, at any time, to discontinue the granting of awards. The board also has the authority to alter or amend the 2021 Plan or any outstanding award or may terminate the 2021 Plan as to further grants, provided that no amendment will, without the approval of our stockholders, to the extent that such approval is required by law or the rules of an applicable exchange, increase the number of shares available under the 2021 Plan, change the persons eligible for awards under the 2021 Plan, extend the time within which awards may be made, or amend the provisions of the 2021 Plan related to amendments. No amendment that would adversely affect any outstanding award made under the 2021 Plan can be made without the consent of the holder of such award. ITEM 12.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entitys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for the preferred convertible instruments\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, during June 2023 the Company declared and issued approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock as a dividend to the Series D Preferred stock shareholder. The Company also modified certain rights and obligations in the Series C and D Preferred Stock certificates of designation. The payment of these dividends and the modification of terms now obligate the Company to issue stock for the unpaid portion of the 8% cumulative dividend for both the Series C and D Preferred Stock. The Company recorded a deemed dividend for the value of unpaid portion of the 8% cumulative dividend. The unpaid stock dividend will be distributed in the future when certain terms and conditions are met and the shareholder requests receipt of such shares. The common stock dividend issued to the Series D shareholder and the value of the unpaid 8% cumulative dividend for Series C and D Preferred Stock is treated as a deemed dividend and both result in an increase of the net loss to be allocated to the common shareholders.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures related to the preferred convertible instruments is a critical audit matter are due to the impact it has on the net loss and calculation of earnings per share for common shareholders plus the nature and extent of audit effort required to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to address the risks of material misstatements related to the accuracy and valuation of deemed dividend after the Series C and D Preferred Stock terms and conditions were modified. The nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter includes involvement of more experienced engagement team members and discussions related to the matter.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included reviewing the modified agreements and determining the impact such changes had on shareholders equity and the loss allocated to common shareholders. Our procedures also included reviewing the calculation for dividend accretion and recognition of a deemed dividend.\n/s/ BPM LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since October 2019\nWalnut Creek, California\nDecember 19, 2023\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 8,023,716\n$ 12,593,692\nTotal current assets\n8,023,716\n12,593,692\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\n81,325\n862,977\nOTHER ASSETS\nOther assets\n15,766\n13,767\nOperating lease right-of-use asset\n145,090\n287,930\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 8,265,897\n$ 13,758,366\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable -

ORGANIZATION\nKnow Labs, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. The Company currently has authorized 205,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 200,000,000 are shares of voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 5,000,000 are shares preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. At the annual shareholder meeting held on October 15, 2021, the Companys authorized shares of common stock was increased to 200,000,000 shares of voting common stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nThe Company is focused on the development and commercialization of our proprietary sensor technology utilizing radio and microwave spectroscopy. When paired with our machine learning platform, our technology is capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify, and measure the unique signature of said materials or analytes.\nThe first application of our sensor technology is in a product to non-invasively monitor blood glucose levels. Our device will provide the user with real-time information on their blood glucose levels. We recently announced our Generation 1 working prototype device. This device embodies the sensor which has been used in internal clinical testing. We have also announced the work our R&D team is doing on the Generation 2 of our device, which is a wearable format and could be a final form factor, ready for commercial application. We are expanding our testing, both internally and externally, and will refine the device over time, which will require FDA clearance before entering the market.\n2. LIQUIDITY\nThe Company has cash and cash equivalents of $8,023,716 and net working capital of $6,262,662 (exclusive of convertible notes payable) as of September 30, 2023. The Company anticipates that it will record losses from operations for the foreseeable future. During the end of the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company made some adjustments to its staffing level and the impact of those adjustments, plus the departure of our chief technology and executive office, has significantly reduced our monthly burn rate. The Company will further adjust its cost structure if new debt or equity capital is not received. The Companys ability to transition profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure. The Company believes that it has enough available cash and flexibility with its operating expenses to operate until at least June 30, 2024. Based on current operating levels, the Company will need to raise additional funds by selling additional equity or incurring debt. To date, the Company has funded its operations primarily through issuance of equity securities, and proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock and the sale of debt instruments. Additionally, future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of revenue growth, the selling price of the Companys products, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of the Companys products. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the date of this Report.\nManagement of the Company intends to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt. The Company is currently working on some capital fund raising transactions and while they expect to have something finalized by March 31, 2024, as of this date, there is no commitment. There can be no assurance that, in the event the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital and reduce discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to achieve its intended business objectives. As a result, the substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe proceeds of warrants currently outstanding, which could be exercised on a cash basis, may generate potential proceeds. The Company expects that portions of these warrants will be exercised but there is no guarantee any portion will be exercised.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nBasis of Presentation -These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Particle and AI Mind. Intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. AI Mind was dissolved in July 2023.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - The Company classifies highly liquid temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased as cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at various financial institutions. Balances at US banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risk for cash on deposit.\nProperty and Equipment - Equipment consists of machinery, leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease period of the relevant asset, generally 2-5 years, except for leasehold improvements which are depreciated over 5 years.\nLong-Lived Assets - The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets under certain circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost associated with selling the asset). To the extent carrying values exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.\nRevenue Recognition - The Company determines revenue recognition from contracts with customers through the following steps:\n\u00b7\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n\u00b7\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u00b7\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7\nrecognition of the revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company generated revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs. The Company engineering team, using its research data, AI and proprietary algorithms, produced NFTs in the form of digital art. The NFTs produced had no recorded cost basis. The Company does not expect future activity or revenue from that source.\nResearch and Development Expenses - Research and development expenses consist of the cost of officers, employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.\nThe Companys current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving its radio frequency spectroscopy technology and its first focus on non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose levels; extending its capacity and developing new and unique applications for this technology. The Company believes that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to its future success. The Company incurred expenses of $7,727,467 and $5,385,586 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on development activities. Included in the expense for 2023 is approximately $859,000 related to severance and other expenses associated with the departure of the Companys former chief technology officer and chief executive officer, Philip A. Bosua, and other employees.\nAdvertising - Advertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $305,292 and $379,724, respectively.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments - ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entitys own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe recorded value of other financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 are based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. The fair value of the Companys convertible notes payable are not readily available given the terms and conditions, including the conversion features, are complex.\nThe Company has a money market account which is considered a Level 1 asset. The balance as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $7,836,393 and $11,821,931, respectively. No other assets or liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring nature.\nDerivative Financial Instruments - Pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, the Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company then determines if an embedded derivative must be bifurcated and separately accounted for. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nThe Company determined that the conversion features for purposes of bifurcation within its convertible notes payable issued during 2020 and 2021 were immaterial and as of September 30, 2023 all such convertible notes have been converted to common stock and there was no derivative liability.\nStock Based Compensation - The Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation is measured by the Company at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. The Company recognizes stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit.\nConvertible Securities - Based upon ASC 815-15, the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of ASC 815-40 to convertible securities to determine if an instrument should be accounted for as equity or a liability. The Company will evaluate its contracts based upon the earliest issuance date. In the event partial reclassification of contracts subject to ASC 815-40-25 is necessary, due to the Companys inability to demonstrate it has sufficient shares authorized and unissued, shares will be allocated on the basis of issuance date, with the earliest issuance date receiving first allocation of shares. If a reclassification of an instrument were required, it would result in the instrument issued latest being reclassified first.\nNet Loss per Share - Under the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Deemed dividends to preferred shareholders increase the net loss available to common shareholders and impact the net loss per share calculation.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had 80,358,463 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2023, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 14,506,158 shares of our common stock (including unearned stock option grants totaling 3,869,825 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 20,866,313 shares of our common stock, 8,108,356 shares of the Companys common stock issuable, collectively, upon the conversion of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and approximately 3,040,219 shares of our common stock, collectively, reserved to pay accrued dividends on our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company currently has 9,020,264 shares of its common stock at the current price of $0.25 per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $2,761,931. Further, under the current terms of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and assuming no changes in the ownership thereof, going forward on a quarterly basis the Company will accrete as a preferred dividend the value of approximately 160,000 shares of common stock, which are issuable if such dividends become payable as additional shares of preferred stock, and such preferred stock is then converted into common stock. All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the September 30, 2023, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had 48,156,062 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, there were options outstanding for the purchase of 20,792,370 common shares (including unearned stock option grants totaling 9,704,620 shares related to performance targets), warrants for the purchase of 21,786,313 common shares, and 8,108,356 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company currently has 9,020,264 common shares at the current price of $0.25 per share reserved and are issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures of $2,255,066. All of the foregoing shares could potentially dilute future earnings per share but are excluded from the September 30, 2022, calculation of net loss per share because their impact is antidilutive.\nComprehensive loss - Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period from non-owner sources. There were no differences between net loss for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and comprehensive loss for those periods.\nDividend Policy - The Company has never paid any cash dividends and intends, for the foreseeable future, to retain any future earnings for the development of its business. The Companys future dividend policy will be determined by the board of directors on the basis of various factors, including results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nBased on the Companys review of accounting standard updates recently issued, those standards not yet required to be adopted and proposed standards for the future, the Company does believe such items are expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n4. AI DEEP LEARNING PLATFORM\nOn September 17, 2021, the Company incorporated AI Mind, Inc. (AI Mind) in the State of Nevada. AI Mind was focused on monetizing intellectual property relating to the artificial intelligence utilized as a part of the data analytics performed with trade secret algorithms. Since incorporation, it focused on creating graphical images which were sold as Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs). During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company began generating revenue from digital asset sales of NFTs and had sales of $4,360,087 of which substantially all were recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2021.\nAfter the sale of the NFT, the Ethereum was converted to US dollars as soon as practically possible. The Company recorded the total value of the gross NFT sale in revenue. Costs incurred in connection with the NFT transaction were recorded in the statement of operations as selling and transactional cost of digital assets and include costs to outside consultants, estimated employee and former CEO special bonus compensation, digital asset conversion losses and estimated sales and use tax. The amount totaled $3,430,438 for the year ended September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, accrued expenses include $0 and $343,878 of expenses, respectively, primarily sales and use tax and other expenses. During the current year, based on new information, we revised our estimate downward for sales and use tax liability resulting in a $274,019 benefit that is recorded in Selling and Transactional Costs for Digital Assets in the consolidated statements of operations.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of the following:\nTotal depreciation expense was $313,019 and $320,995 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All equipment is used primarily for research and development purposes and accordingly $295,260 and $304,637 in depreciation is classified in research and development expenses during the years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Company retired assets with a net book value of $549,431 during the year ended September 30, 2023 related to the consolidation of leased offices and the reduction on headcount.\n6. LEASES\nThe Company has entered into operating leases for office and development facilities which range from two to three years and include options to renew. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease based upon the unique facts and circumstances at the inception of the lease. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use asses are recorded based upon the present value of the lease payments over the expected lease term. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, total operating lease liabilities for remaining long term leases was approximately $155,000 and $303,000, respectively. Right of use assets totaled approximately $145,000 and $288,000 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $268,000 and $289,000, respectively in total lease costs for the leases. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. Recently the Company, as a result of certain headcount adjustments, has listed two of its leased premises as available for sublease. There can be no assurance such sublease will be successful or lead to a reduction in current on-going lease payments.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for the operating leases was 9 months at September 30, 2023 and the weighted average discount rate was 7%.\nThe minimum future lease payments as of September 30, 2023 are as follows:\n7.

EQUITY\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe following description summarizes important terms of the classes of our capital stock as of September 30, 2023. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our articles of incorporation as amended, restated and supplemented to date, or our articles of incorporation, and our second amended and restated bylaws, or our bylaws, which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAuthorized Capital Stock. The Companys authorized capital stock currently consists of:\n\u00b7\n200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share; and\n\u00b7\n5,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which:\n\u00b7\n30,000 shares have been designated as our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share; and\n\u00b7\n20,000 shares have been designated as our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share.\nOutstanding Shares of Capital Stock. The Companys common stock is the only security of the Company registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All outstanding shares of the Companys capital stock are fully paid and nonassessable. As of September 30, 2023, there were:\n\u00b7\n80,358,643 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, held by holders of record;\n\u00b7\n17,858 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, held by one holder of record; and\n\u00b7\n10,161 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, held by one holder of record.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of the Companys common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. The Companys articles of incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nSubject to any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably those dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors on the common stock out of legally available funds. In the event of the Companys liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of the Companys debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock.\nHolders of common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock, including our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Companys articles of incorporation authorize its board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and to determine the designation, preferences, limitations and relative rights thereof, including, without limitation, such matters as dividends, redemption, liquidation, conversion and voting. The Companys board of directors has the discretion to issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock, or which could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of the Companys outstanding voting stock.\nIn connection with the amendment and restatement of our preferred stock, we effected a reverse split of our outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock by a factor of 1-for-100. No changes were made to the 5 million total shares of blank-check preferred stock authorized in our Articles. Prior to such reverse split, there were 1,785,715 and 1,016,004 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock designated and outstanding, respectively. To account for the reverse split, but in order to provide the ability to issue pay in kind dividends in lieu of cash dividends, at the time of the reverse split, we designated 30,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and 20,000 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, of which 17,858 and 10,161 shares were, respectively, outstanding immediately after such reverse split. In order to maintain the economic rights of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, the definition of Stated Value was multiplied by 100, to offset the reverse split factor. All amount related to the preferred shares have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split as it occurred on the date of the first period presented.\nSecurities Subject to Price Adjustments\nIf in the future, the Company sells its common stock at a price below $0.25 per share, the conversion price of the Companys outstanding shares of series C convertible preferred stock and series D convertible preferred stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. In addition, the conversion price of the convertible promissory notes referred to above and the exercise price of certain outstanding warrants to purchase 7,684,381 shares of common stock would adjust below $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Warrants totaling 4,439,707 would adjust below $1.20 per share and warrants totaling 4,424,425 would adjust below $2.40 per share, in each case pursuant to the documents governing such instruments.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeries C and D Preferred Stock, Warrants and Dividends\nOn August 5, 2016, the Company closed a Series C Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Clayton A. Struve, an accredited investor for the purchase of $1,250,000 of preferred stock with a conversion price of $0.70 per share. The preferred stock has a cumulative dividend of 8% and an ownership blocker of 4.99%. Dividends are due and payable in cash when declared by the Company or when the stock is converted. Series C Preferred stock is senior to Series D Preferred stock and is entitled to receive equal dividends paid to Series D. In addition, Mr. Struve received a five-year warrant to acquire 1,785,714 shares of common stock at $0.70 per share. On August 14, 2017, the price of the Series C Stock and warrant and its conversion price, were adjusted to $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. As of September 30, 2023, Mr. Struve owns all of the 1,785,715 issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock. Each holder of Preferred Series C is allowed to vote as a common shareholder as if the shares were converted to common stock up to the ownership blocker of 4.99%.\nIn 2017 the Company closed a $750,000 Series D Preferred Stock and Warrant offering with Mr. Struve. As of September 30, 2023, Mr. Struve owns all of the 1,016,004 issued and outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock. Each outstanding share of series D preferred stock will accrue cumulative cash dividends at a rate equal to 8.0% per annum, subject to adjustment as provided in the series D preferred stock certificate of designations. Dividends are due and payable in cash when declared by the Company or when the stock is converted. In addition, On August 14, 2017, the price of the Series D Preferred Stock were adjusted to $0.25 per share pursuant to the documents governing such instruments. Each holder of Preferred Series D is allowed to vote as a common shareholder as if the shares were converted to common stock up to the ownership blocker of 4.99%.\nIn August, 2023, as part of a modification of the Series C and Series D Preferred certificates of designation, such preferred stock does not accrue or pay cash dividends. All future dividends will be accrued and paid in Series C or Series D stock, as applicable. As was the case prior to the modifications of the Series C and Series D preferred stock, although accrual of dividends is required as described below, no dividends are actually paid, and no shares actually issued, until a conversion of such stock or declaration of the dividend by the Board of Directors. Additionally the Series D Preferred stock will no longer be required to automatically convert to common stock based on listing of the Companys common stock on the NYSE American, except if the volume weighted average price of the common stock is at least $2.50 per share for 20 trading days and certain other requirements are satisfied. The cumulative dividends accrued and paid in preferred stock will be determined based upon a $.70 stated value. The conversion from preferred stock into common stock is determined based dividing the $.70 stated value by the $.25 conversion price. In June, 2023, as part of the anticipated modification of the certificates of designation of the Series C and Series D preferred stock, at Mr. Struves request, the Company settled all cash dividends with respect to the Series D preferred stock accrued and accumulated through December 31, 2022 in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Struve of 1,402,784 shares of the Companys common stock in reliance on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded $1,627,230 in dividends, representing the fair market value of the 1,402,784 shares issued.\nBased upon the modified terms and conditions of Series C and D certificates of designations, it was determined that Series C and D preferred dividends need to be accreted going forward. As of September 30, 2023, cumulative unpaid Series C and D dividends totaled approximately $770,000, which on a converted-to-common-stock basis represents approximately 3,040,000 shares of common stock. The value of the 3.0 million shares of common totaled $3,526,653. The Company recorded $3,526,653in cumulative deemed dividends related to Series C and D Preferred Stock which have not been paid, net of the approximately $351,000 of accumulated dividends with respect to the Series D preferred that were settled for 1,402,784 shares of common stock as noted above. Mr. Struve is subject to an ownership blocker limiting his ownership to 4.99% and thus the amount of common shares he can receive for dividends. Unpaid accreted stock dividends will be issued to Mr. Struve if he converts preferred stock or if the Board declares a dividend thereon, limited to his 4.99% ownership blocker. Assuming no changes in the amount of outstanding Preferred Series C or D ownership, going forward on a quarterly basis the Company will accrete as a preferred dividend the value of approximately 160,000 shares of common stock, which are issuable if such dividends become payable as additional shares of preferred stock, and such preferred stock is then converted into common stock.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommon Stock\nEach share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, and no cumulative voting for directors is permitted.

INCOME TAXES\nThe Company has incurred losses since inception, which have generated net operating loss carryforwards. The net operating loss carryforwards arise from United States sources.\nLosses arising from United States taxable operations were approximately $4.2 million and $7.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company has Federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $49.5 million which expire in 2028-2042. Because it is not more likely than not that sufficient tax earnings will be generated to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards, a corresponding valuation allowance equal to 100% of the gross deferred tax asset of approximately $14.2 million and $11.4 million was established as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company does not recognize the majority of state tax loss operating loss carryforwards as a deferred tax asset given it no longer has any operation in those states.\nUnder the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of, and benefits from, net operating losses may be limited in certain circumstances, including a change in control. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards in the future. The Company is subject to possible tax examination for the years 2017 through 2023.\nKNOW LABS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe principal components of the Companys deferred tax assets at September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nNet operating loss carryforward\n$ 10,476,000\n$ 9,372,000\nStock based compensation\n2,174,000\n1,677,000\nResearch and Development\n1,460,000\n-\nIntangibles\n-\n221,000\nAccruals and reserves\n46,000\n97,000\nTotal deferred tax asset\n14,156,000\n11,367,000\nValuation allowance\n(14,156,000 )\n(11,367,000 )\nNet deferred tax assets\n$ -\n$ -\nChange in valuation allowance during the year\n$ (2,789,000 )\n$ (1,666,000 )\nA reconciliation of the United States Federal Statutory rate to the Companys effective tax rate for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Companys effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate principally due to nondeductible expenses plus an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nIncome tax provision at statutory rate\n21 %\n21 %\nNon deductible expenses\n1 %\n12 %\nChange in valuation allowance\n18 %\n7 %\nOther and prior year true up\n2 %\n2 %\nEffective tax rate\n0 %\n0 %\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were no uncertain tax positions.
