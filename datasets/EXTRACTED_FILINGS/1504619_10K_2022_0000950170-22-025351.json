    "content": "Item 1.\tBusiness\nGeneral Business of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital by investing primarily in floating rate loans, and other investments made to U.S. middle-market companies.\nWe believe that floating rate loans to U.S. middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We use the term middle-market to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. Our investments are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans, high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. However, when compared to junk bonds and other non-investment grade debt, senior secured floating rate loans typically have more robust capital-preserving qualities, such as historically lower default rates than junk bonds, represent the senior source of capital in a borrowers capital structure and often have certain of the borrowers assets pledged as collateral. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.\nUnder normal market conditions, we generally expect that at least 80% of the value of our managed assets, which means our net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes, will be invested in floating rate loans and other investments bearing a variable-rate of interest. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least 65% of our overall portfolio. We also generally expect to invest up to 35% of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt and subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. We seek to create a diversified portfolio by generally targeting an investment size between $5 million and $30 million, on average, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nOur investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nOrganization and Structure of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a Maryland corporation organized in October 2010, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\nFunding I, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a special purpose entity, was organized in Delaware as a limited liability company in May 2011. We formed Funding I in order to establish our Prior Credit Facility. On August 12, 2021, we terminated the Prior Credit Facility, and Funding I, as borrower, entered into the Credit Facility, which provides the ability for Funding I to borrow up to $366 million (increased from $300 million in September 2022). The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding I.\nIn May 2017, we and a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KMPR), Trinity Universal Insurance Company, or Kemper, formed PSSL, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company.\nIn April 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Securitization Issuer, was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We formed the Securitization Issuer in order to complete the Debt Securitization.\nOur Investment Adviser and Administrator\nWe utilize the investing experience and contacts of PennantPark Investment Advisers in developing what we believe is an attractive and diversified portfolio. The senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in the senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. In addition, our senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring,\nnegotiating, managing and monitoring investments in each of these businesses across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this experience and history have resulted in a strong reputation with financial sponsors, management teams, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which provides us with access to substantial investment opportunities across the capital markets. Our Investment Adviser has a rigorous investment approach, which is based upon intensive financial analysis with a focus on capital preservation, diversification and active management. Since our Investment Advisers inception in 2007, it has invested through its managed funds $17.1 billion in 628 companies with more than 200 different financial sponsors through its managed funds, which includes investments by the Company totaling $5.0 billion in 451 companies.\nOur Administrator has experienced professionals with substantial backgrounds in finance and administration of registered investment companies. In addition to furnishing us with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services, the Administrator also oversees our financial records as well as the preparation of our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The Administrator assists in the determination and publication of our net asset value, or NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and monitors the payment of our expenses as well as the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Furthermore, our Administrator offers, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns for more information.\nMarket Opportunity\nWe believe that the limited amount of capital available to middle-market companies, coupled with the desire of these companies for flexible sources of capital, creates an attractive investment environment for us.\nWe believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty raising debt in private markets. From time to time, banks, finance companies, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, funds have withdrawn, and may again withdraw, capital from the middle-market, resulting in opportunities for alternative funding sources.\nWe believe middle-market companies have faced difficulty in raising debt through the capital markets. Many middle-market companies look to raise funds by issuing high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans. We believe this approach to financing becomes difficult at times when institutional investors seek to invest in larger, more liquid offerings. We believe this has made it harder for middle-market companies to raise funds by issuing high-yield securities from time to time.\nWe believe that credit market dislocation for middle-market companies improves the risk-reward on our investments. From time to time, market participants have reduced lending to middle-market and non-investment grade borrowers. As a result, we believe there is less competition in our market, more conservative capital structures, higher yields and stronger covenants.\nWe believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek to combine their capital with sources of debt capital to complete private investments. We expect that private equity firms will continue to be active investors in middle-market companies. These private equity funds generally seek to leverage their investments by combining their capital with loans provided by other sources, and we believe that we are well-positioned to partner with such equity investors.\nWe believe there is substantial supply of opportunities resulting from maturing loans that seek refinancing. A high volume of financings will come due in the next few years. Additionally, we believe that demand for debt financing from middle-market companies will remain strong because these companies will continue to require credit to refinance existing debt, to support growth initiatives and to finance acquisitions. We believe the combination of strong demand by middle-market companies and, from time to time, the reduced supply of credit described above should increase lending opportunities for us. We believe this supply of opportunities coupled with a lack of demand offers attractive risk-reward to investors.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe that we have the following competitive advantages over other capital providers to middle-market companies:\na)Experienced Management Team\nThe senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser have worked together for many years and average over 25 years of experience in senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses. These senior investment professionals have been involved in originating, structuring, negotiating, managing and monitoring investments in each of these businesses across changing economic and market cycles. We believe this extensive experience and history have resulted in a strong reputation across the capital markets.\nLending to middle-market companies requires in-depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. For example, lending to middle-market companies in the United States is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies. We are able to provide value-added customized financial solutions to middle-market companies as a result of specialized due diligence, underwriting capabilities and more extensive ongoing monitoring required as lenders.\nb)Disciplined Investment Approach with Strong Value Orientation\nWe employ a disciplined approach in selecting investments that meet the long-standing, consistent value-oriented investment selection criteria employed by our Investment Adviser. Our value-oriented investment philosophy focuses on preserving capital and ensuring that our investments have an appropriate return profile in relation to risk. When market conditions make it difficult for us to invest according to our criteria, we are highly selective in deploying our capital. We believe this approach continues to enable us to build an attractive investment portfolio that meets our return and value criteria over the long-term.\nWe believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets. In evaluating new investments we, through our Investment Adviser, conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our Investment Advisers experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Among other things, our due diligence is designed to ensure that each prospective portfolio company will be able to meet its debt service obligations. See Investment Selection Criteria for more information.\nIn addition to engaging in extensive due diligence, our Investment Adviser seeks to reduce risk by focusing on businesses with:\nstrong competitive positions;\npositive cash flow that is steady and stable;\nexperienced management teams with strong track records;\npotential for growth and viable exit strategies; and\ncapital structures offering appropriate risk-adjusted terms and covenants.\nc)Ability to Source and Evaluate Transactions through our Investment Advisers Proactive Research Capability and Established Network\nThe management team of our Investment Adviser has long-term relationships with financial sponsors, management consultants and management teams that we believe enable us to evaluate investment opportunities effectively in numerous industries, as well as provide us access to substantial information concerning those industries. We identify potential investments both through active origination and through dialogue with numerous financial sponsors, management teams, members of the financial community and corporate partners with whom the professionals of our Investment Adviser have long-term relationships.\nd)Flexible Transaction Structuring\nWe are flexible in structuring investments and tailor investments to meet the needs of a portfolio company while also generating attractive risk-adjusted returns. We can invest in all parts of a capital structure and our Investment Adviser has extensive experience in a wide variety of securities for leveraged companies throughout economic and market cycles.\nOur Investment Adviser seeks to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation. In making investment decisions, we seek to invest in companies that we believe can generate consistent positive risk-adjusted returns.\nWe believe that the in-depth experience of our Investment Adviser will enable us to invest throughout various stages of the economic and market cycles and to provide us with ongoing market insights in addition to a significant investment opportunity.\nCompetition\nOur primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, CLO funds, private direct lending funds and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, frequently invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities in middle-market companies can be intense. However, we believe that from time to time there has been a reduction in the amount of debt capital available to middle-market companies, which we believe has resulted in a less competitive environment for making new investments.\nMany of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities for more information.\nLeverage\nAs of September 30, 2022, we maintained a $366 million (increased from $300 million in September 2022) Credit Facility, which matures in August 2026, with the Lenders. The Credit Facility currently bears interest at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 225 basis points and, after the revolving period ends in August 2024, the rate will reset to Base Rate (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 250 basis points. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by Funding I, under which we had $168.8 million outstanding as of September 30, 2022. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 4.9%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of September 30, 2022 . The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $197.2 million and $80.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, respectively, subject to the regulatory restrictions. We believe that our capital resources will provide us with the flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when they arise. Our use of leverage, as calculated under the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act, may generally range between 140% and 170% of our net assets, or approximately 60% to 65% of our managed assets. We cannot assure investors that our leverage will remain within the range. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021 we had $97.0 million and $117.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes outstanding, respectively. The 2023 Notes were issued pursuant to a deed of trust between the Company and Mishmeret Trust Company, Ltd. as trustee. The 2023 Notes pay interest at a rate of 4.3% per year. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2018. The principal on the 2023 Notes will be payable in four annual installments as follows: 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and 55% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2023.\nIn March 2021, and in October 2021, we issued $100.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4% and 101.5%, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $185.0 million and $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes outstanding, respectively. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to the Base Indenture, dated March 23, 2021 (the Base Indenture), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (the Trustee), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated March 23, 2021, between the Company and the Trustee. The 2026 Notes are due on April 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Companys option. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25% per year payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes are the Companys direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Companys current and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness, senior to any of the Companys future indebtedness that expressly states it is subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes, effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured, but to which the Company subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Companys subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nIn September 2019, the Securitization Issuers completed the Debt Securitization. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by the middle market loans, participation interests in middle market loans and other assets of the Securitization Issuer. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2031. On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, the Securitization Issuer transferred to us 100% of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, 100% of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. As of both September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $228.0 million of 2031 Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% and 2.6%, respectively. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information.\nIn April 2021, we formed PTSF, an unconsolidated limited partnership, organized as a Delaware limited liability partnership. We sold $81.4 million in investments to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTSF in exchange for cash in the amount of $69.5 million and an $11.9 million equity interest in PTSF representing 23.08% of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF. We recognized $0.4 million of realized gain upon the formation of PTSF. As of September 30, 2022, our capital commitment of $15.3 million is fully funded and we hold 23.08% of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF and a 4.99% voting interest in the general partner which manages PTSF.\nOn April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act). As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), effective as of April 5, 2019, subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 178% and 175%, respectively. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information.\nInvestment Policy Overview\nWe seek to create a diversified portfolio primarily of floating rate loans by generally targeting an investment size of $5 million to $30 million in securities, on average, of middle-market companies. We expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least 65% of our overall portfolio. We also generally expect to invest up to 35% of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. The companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, are not rated by national rating agencies. If such unrated companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poors system) from the national rating agencies. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans, high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. In addition, we expect our debt investments to range in maturity from three to ten years.\nOver time, we expect that our portfolio will continue to consist primarily of floating rate loans in qualifying assets such as private, or thinly traded or small market-capitalization, U.S. middle-market public companies. In addition, we may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets. These non-qualifying assets may include investments in public companies whose securities are not thinly traded or have a market capitalization of greater than $250 million, securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States and investment companies as defined in the 1940 Act. We may acquire investments in the secondary markets. See Regulation-Qualifying Assets and Investment Selection Criteria for more information.\nOur board of directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval (except as required by the 1940 Act). However, absent stockholder approval, under the 1940 Act we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our common stock. Nevertheless, the effects of changes to our operating policies and strategies may adversely affect our business, our ability to make distributions and the value of our common stock.\nFirst Lien Secured Debt\nStructurally, first lien secured debt ranks senior in priority of payment to second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity and benefits from a senior security interest in the assets of the borrower. As such, other creditors rank junior to our investments in these securities in the event of insolvency. Due to its lower risk profile and often more restrictive covenants as compared to second lien secured debt and subordinated debt, first lien secured debt generally earns a lower return than second lien secured debt and subordinated debt. In some cases first lien secured debt lenders receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond Lien Secured Debt\nSecond lien secured debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt. Second lien secured debt holds a second priority with regard to right of payment in the event of insolvency. Second lien secured debt ranks senior to subordinated debt and common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt. In many cases, second lien secured debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers and from time to time may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis.\nSubordinated Debt\nStructurally, subordinated debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, and is often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. Subordinated debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants as compared to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, subordinated debt generally earns a higher return than first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt. In many cases, subordinated debt investors receive opportunities to invest directly in the equity securities of borrowers, and from time to time, may also receive warrants to purchase equity securities. We evaluate these investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis.\nInvestment Selection Criteria\nWe are committed to a value-oriented philosophy used by the senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser who manage our portfolio and seek to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing potential for capital appreciation.\nWe have identified several criteria, discussed below, that we believe are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, we caution that not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to use our experience and access to market information to identify investment opportunities and to structure investments efficiently and effectively.\na)Leading and defensible competitive market positions\nThe Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their markets. The Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes possess competitive advantages in, for example, scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality as compared to their competitors to protect their market position.\nb)Investing in stable borrowers with positive cash flow\nOur investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis and has a distinct value-orientation. The Investment Adviser invests in portfolio companies it believes to be stable and well-established, with strong cash flows and profitability. The Investment Adviser believes these attributes indicate portfolio companies that may be well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their liabilities and maintain growth in their businesses or their relative market share. The Investment Adviser currently does not expect to invest significantly in start-up companies, companies in turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans, although we are permitted to do so.\nc)Proven management teams\nThe Investment Adviser focuses on investments in which the portfolio company has an experienced management team with an established track record of success. The Investment Adviser typically requires that portfolio companies have in place proper incentives to align managements goals with our goals, including having equity interests.\nd)Financial sponsorship\nThe Investment Adviser may seek to cause us to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be trusted financial sponsors. The Investment Adviser believes that a financial sponsors willingness to invest significant equity capital in a portfolio company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of that portfolio company. Further, financial sponsors of portfolio companies with significant investments at risk may have the ability, and a strong incentive, to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should financial or operational issues arise so as to maintain their ownership position.\ne)Investments in different borrowers, industries and geographies\nThe Investment Adviser seeks to invest our assets broadly among portfolio companies, across industries and geographical regions. The Investment Adviser believes that this approach may reduce the risk that a downturn in any one portfolio company, industry or geographical region will have a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio, although we are permitted to be non-diversified under the 1940 Act.\nf)Viable exit strategy\nThe Investment Adviser seeks to invest in portfolio companies that it believes will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans while also reinvesting in their respective businesses. The Investment Adviser expects that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we will exit from our investments over time. In addition, the Investment Adviser also seeks to invest in portfolio companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock, refinancing or other capital markets transaction.\nDue Diligence\nWe believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence in evaluating new investment targets. Our Investment Adviser conducts a rigorous due diligence process that is applied to prospective portfolio companies and draws from our Investment Advisers experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. In conducting due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses information provided by companies, financial sponsors and publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers.\nOur due diligence may include:\nreview of historical and prospective financial information;\nresearch relating to the portfolio companys management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors;\ninterviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company;\non-site visits;\nreview of loan documents; and\nbackground checks.\nAdditional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.\nUpon the completion of due diligence on a portfolio company, the team leading the investment presents the investment opportunity to our Investment Advisers investment committee. This committee determines whether to pursue the potential investment. All new investments are required to be reviewed by the investment committee of our Investment Adviser. The members of the investment committee receive no compensation from us. Rather, they are employees of and receive compensation from our Investment Adviser.\nInvestment Structure\nOnce we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that portfolio company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate with these parties to agree on how our investment is structured relative to the other capital in the portfolio companys capital structure.\nWe expect our floating rate loans to have terms of three to ten years. We generally obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company.\nTypically, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt investments have maturities of three to ten years. Second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or payment-in-kind, or PIK, payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Also, in some cases, our second lien secured debt and subordinated debt may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower.\nWe seek to tailor the terms of the investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:\nrequiring a total return on our investments (including both interest in the form of a floor and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk;\nincorporating put rights and call protection into the investment structure; and\nnegotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with our focus of preserving capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights.\nOur investments may include equity features, such as direct investments in the equity securities of borrowers or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights.\nWe expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may exit certain investments earlier when a liquidity event, such as the sale or refinancing of a portfolio company, takes place. We also may turn over investments to better position the portfolio in light of market conditions.\nOngoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies\nMonitoring\nThe Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Investment Adviser also monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company.\nThe Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\nassessment of success in adhering to a portfolio companys business plan and compliance with covenants;\nperiodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;\ncomparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry, if any;\nattendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and\nreview of periodic financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.\nThe Investment Adviser monitors credit risk of each portfolio company regularly with a goal toward identifying early, and when able and appropriate, exiting investments with potential credit problems. This monitoring process may include reviewing: (1) a portfolio companys financial resources and operating history; (2) comparing a portfolio companys current operating results with the Investment Advisers initial thesis for the investment and its expectations for the performance of the investment; (3) a portfolio companys sensitivity to economic conditions; (4) the performance of a portfolio companys management; (5) a portfolio companys debt maturities and capital requirements; (6) a portfolio companys interest and asset coverage; and (7) the relative value of an investment based on a portfolio companys anticipated cash flow.\nManagerial Assistance\nWe offer significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. As a BDC, we are required to make available such significant managerial assistance within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. See Regulation for more information.\nStaffing\nWe do not currently have any employees. Our Investment Adviser and Administrator have hired and expect to continue to hire professionals with skills applicable to our business plan, including experience in middle-market investing, senior lending, mezzanine lending, leveraged finance, distressed debt and private equity businesses.\nOur Corporate Information\nOur administrative and principal executive offices are located at 1691 Michigan Avenue, Miami, Florida.

We generally seek to target companies that generate positive cash flows from the broad variety of industries in which our Investment Adviser has direct expertise. The following is an illustrative list of the industries in which the Investment Adviser has invested:\nAerospace and Defense\nEnergy/Utilities\nAuto Sector\nEnvironmental Services\nBeverage, Food and Tobacco\nFinancial Services\nBroadcasting and Entertainment\nGrocery\nBuildings and Real Estate\nHealthcare, Education and Childcare\nBuilding Materials\nHigh Tech Industries\nBusiness Services\nHome & Office Furnishings, Housewares & Durable Consumer Products\nCable Television\nHotels, Motels, Inns and Gaming\nCapital Equipment\nInsurance\nCargo Transportation\nLeisure, Amusement, Motion Picture, Entertainment\nChemicals, Plastics and Rubber\nLogistics\nCommunications\nManufacturing/Basic Industries\nConsumer Products\nMedia\nConsumer Services\nMining, Steel, Iron and Non-Precious Metals\nContainers Packaging & Glass\nOil and Gas\nDistribution\nOther Media\nDiversified/Conglomerate Manufacturing\nPersonal, Food and Miscellaneous Services\nDiversified/Conglomerate Services\nPrinting and Publishing\nDiversified Natural Resources, Precious Metals and Minerals\nRetail\nEducation\nWholesale\nElectronics\nListed below are our top ten portfolio companies and industries represented as a percentage of our consolidated portfolio assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) as of September 30:\nPortfolio Company\n2022 (1)\nPortfolio Company\n2021 (1)\nBy Light Professional IT Services, LLC\n%\nBy Light Professional IT Services, LLC\n%\nMarketplace Events LLC\nLilly Lashes\nOx Two, LLC\nMarketplace Events LLC\nGCOM Software LLC\nLightspeed Buyer Inc.\nTVC Enterprises, LLC\nMeritDirect, LLC\nLightspeed Buyer Inc.\nOx Two, LLC\nKinetic Purchaser, LLC\nTVC Enterprises, LLC\nApex Service Partners, LLC\nGCOM Software LLC\nCartessa Aesthetics, LLC\nLombart Brothers, Inc.\nUBEO, LLC\nUBEO, LLC\nIndustry\n2022 (1)\nIndustry\n2021 (1)\nProfessional Services\n%\nMedia\n%\nMedia\nProfessional Services\nPersonal Products\nPersonal Products\nIT Services\nCapital Equipment\nHigh Tech Industries\nCommercial Services & Supplies\nMedia: Diversified and Production\nIT Services\nCommercial Services & Supplies\nMedia: Diversified and Production\nAerospace and Defense\nBusiness Services\nCapital Equipment\nHealthcare Technology\nHealthcare Technology\nHigh Tech Industries\n(1)Excludes investments in PSSL.\nOur executive officers and directors, as well as the senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do. Currently, the executive officers and directors, as well as certain of the current senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator, serve as officers and directors of PennantPark Investment Corporation, a publicly traded BDC, and other managed funds, as applicable. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which obligations might not be in the best interest of us or our stockholders. In addition, we note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently existing, or formed in the future, and managed by the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may, notwithstanding different stated investment objectives, have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other entities. The Investment Adviser will allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our allocation policy, and we have received exemptive relief with respect to certain co-investment transactions. Where co-investment is unavailable or inappropriate, the Investment Adviser will choose which investment fund should receive the allocation. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns for more information.\nWe may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies and companies that would be investment companies but are excluded from the definition of an investment company provided in Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act. We may also co-invest in the future on a concurrent basis with our affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations, our trade allocation procedures and, if applicable, the terms of our exemptive relief.\nInvestment Management Agreement\nWe have entered into an agreement with the Investment Adviser, or the Investment Management Agreement, under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, us. Mr. Penn, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing member and a senior investment professional of, and has a financial and controlling interest in, PennantPark Investment Advisers.\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., through the Investment Adviser, provides similar services to Funding I under its collateral management agreement. Funding Is collateral management agreement does not affect the management or incentive fees that we pay to the Investment Adviser on a consolidated basis. Under the terms of our Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser:\ndetermines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;\nidentifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);\ncloses and monitors the investments we make; and\nprovides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may need from time to time.\nPennantPark Investment Advisers services under our Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services, without the prior approval of our stockholders or our board of directors, to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Our board of directors monitors for any potential conflicts that may arise upon such a development. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us, consisting of two components-a base management fee and an incentive fee or, collectively, Management Fees.\nInvestment Advisory Fees\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of our average adjusted gross assets, which equals our gross assets (net of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Investment Adviser earned a base management fee of $11.9 million, $10.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, from us.\nThe following is a hypothetical example of the calculation of average adjusted gross assets:\nGross assets as of December 31, 20XX = $160 million\nU.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of December 31, 20XX = $10 million\nAdjusted gross assets as of December 31, 20XX = $150 million\nGross assets as of March 31, 20XX = $200 million\nU.S. Treasury bills and temporary draws on credit facilities as of March 31, 20XX = $20 million\nAdjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX = $180 million\nAverage value of adjusted gross assets as of March 31, 20XX and December 31, 20XX, which are the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter equals ($150 million + $180 million) / 2 = $165 million.\nThe incentive fee has two parts, as follows:\nOne part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facility and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, or OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). We pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75%, (2) 50% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.9167% in any calendar quarter (11.67% annualized) (we refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.9167%) as the catch-up, which is meant to provide our Investment Adviser with 20% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as if a hurdle did not apply, if this net investment income exceeds 2.9167% in any calendar quarter), and (3) 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.9167% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Investment Adviser earned $11.6 million, $5.3 million and $9.3 million, respectively, in incentive fees on net investment income from us.\nThe following is a graphical representation of the calculation of quarterly incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income:\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\n(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)\nPercentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\nallocated to income-related portion of incentive fee\nThe second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we accrued an incentive fee on capital gains of approximately zero, respectively, as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above).\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid or accrued in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The incentive fee accrued for under GAAP on our unrealized and realized capital gains for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was zero, respectively.\nExamples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation\nExample 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*):\nAlternative 1:\nAssumptions\nInvestment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%\nHurdle (1) = 1.75%\nBase management fee (2) = 0.25%\nOther expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\n(investment income-(base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.80%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle;

The principal executive office of PennantPark Investment Advisers is located at 1691 Michigan Avenue, Miami, Florida 33139.\nDuration and Termination of Investment Management Agreement\nThe Investment Management Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, in February 2022. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Management Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through February 2023. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser. In determining to reapprove the Investment Management Agreement, our board of directors requested information from the Investment Adviser that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included the nature, quality and extent of services performed by the Investment Adviser, the Investment Advisers ability to manage conflicts of interest effectively, our short and long-term performance, our costs, including as compared to comparable externally and internally managed publicly traded BDCs that engage in similar investing activities, the Investment Advisers profitability, any economies of scale, and any other benefits of the relationship for the Investment Adviser. Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and reapproved the Investment Management Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-We are dependent upon our Investment Advisers key personnel for our future success, and if our Investment Adviser is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if our Investment Adviser loses any member of its management team, our ability to achieve our investment objectives could be significantly harmed for more information.\nAdministration Agreement\nWe have entered into an agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator, under which the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. Under our Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other activities, being responsible for the financial records we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our NAV, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the cost of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. The Administrator also offers on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. Reimbursement for certain of these costs is included in administrative services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we reimbursed the Investment Adviser approximately $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, including expenses the Investment Adviser incurred on behalf of the Administrator, for services described above.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Administration Agreement with the Administrator was amended to clarify that the Administrator may be reimbursed by the Company for certain (i) tax and general legal advice and/or services provided to the Company by in-house professionals of the Administrator related to ongoing operations of the Company; and (ii) transactional legal advice and/or services provided to the Company or portfolio companies by in-house professionals of the Administrator or its affiliates on matters related to potential or actual investments and transactions, including tax structuring and/or due diligence.\nDuration and Termination of Administration Agreement\nThe Administration Agreement was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2022. Unless terminated earlier as described below, our Administration Agreement will continue in effect for a period of one year through February 2023. It will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the consent of the other party. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days written notice to the other.\nIndemnification\nOur Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement provide that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their duties and obligations, PennantPark Investment Advisers and PennantPark Investment Administration and their officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with them are entitled to indemnification from us for\nany damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of PennantPark Investment Advisers and PennantPark Investment Administrations services under our Investment Management Agreement or Administration Agreement or otherwise as Investment Adviser or Administrator for us.\nLicense Agreement\nWe have entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with PennantPark Investment Advisers pursuant to which PennantPark Investment Advisers has granted us a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the name PennantPark. Under this agreement, we have a right to use the PennantPark name, for so long as PennantPark Investment Advisers or one of its affiliates remains our Investment Adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the PennantPark name.\nPennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC\nIn May 2017, we and Kemper formed PSSL, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, PSSL had total assets of $796.8 million and $603.6 million, respectively. PSSLs portfolio consisted of debt investments in 95 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was $19.3 million and the five largest investments totaled $86.9 million. PSSL invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest. As of September 30, 2021, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was $18.9 million and the five largest investments totaled $84.3 million\nWe provide capital to PSSL in the form of first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we and Kemper owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our investment made in PSSL consisted of first lien secured debt of $190.2 million (additional $19.9 million unfunded) and $140.9 million (additional $29.4 million unfunded), respectively, and equity interests of $81.5 million (additional $8.5 million unfunded) and $60.4 million (additional $12.6 million unfunded), respectively.\nREGULATION\nBusiness Development Company and Regulated Investment Company Regulations\nWe are a BDC under the 1940 Act, which has qualified and intends to continue to qualify to maintain an election to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a BDC and its affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.\nWe may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an underwriter as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of securities we own or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any registered investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one registered investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. None of these policies are fundamental and they may be changed without stockholder approval.\nQualifying Assets\nUnder the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDCs total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:\n(1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined under the 1940 Act to include any issuer which:\n(a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;\n(b)is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but is excluded from the definition of an investment company by Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act; and\n(c)satisfies any of the following:\n(i)does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;\n(ii)has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a maximum market capitalization of $250.0 million; or\n(iii)is controlled by a BDC, either alone or as part of a group acting together, and such BDC in fact exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of such eligible portfolio company and, as a result of such control, has an affiliated person who is a director of such eligible portfolio company.\n(2)Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.\n(3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. operating company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incidental thereto, if such issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.\n(4)Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no readily available market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.\n(5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.\n(6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.\nIn addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.\nManagerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies\nAs a BDC, we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies that constitute a qualifying asset within the meaning of Section 2(a)(47) of the 1940 Act. However, if a BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such significant managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Our Administrator may provide such assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request such assistance. Officers of our Investment Adviser and Administrator may provide assistance to controlled affiliates.\nTemporary Investments\nPending investments in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests, as defined below under Regulation-Election to be Treated as a RIC, in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we may enter into repurchase agreement transactions.\nSenior Securities\nWe are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act and referred to as the asset coverage ratio, is compliant with the 1940 Act, immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage requirement at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to our asset coverage ratio. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business and Structure-Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital for more information.\nJoint Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct\nWe and PennantPark Investment Advisers have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and a code of conduct that establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the codes requirements. Our joint code of ethics and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com. In addition, the joint code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Report and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs Internet website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain a copy of our joint code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov.\nProxy Voting Policies and Procedures\nWe have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, we, our and us refer to our Investment Adviser.\nIntroduction\nAs an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients.\nThese policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.\nProxy Policies\nWe vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interests of our stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.\nOur proxy voting decisions are made by the senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.\nProxy Voting Records\nYou may obtain information about how we voted proxies, free of charge, by calling us collect at (786) 297-9500 or by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Richard T. Allorto Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, 1691 Michigan Ave, Miami, Florida 33139.\nPrivacy Protection Principles\nWe are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.\nGenerally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).\nWe restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.\nOur privacy protection policies are available, free of charge, on our website at www.pennantpark.com. In addition, the privacy policy is available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs Internet website at www.sec.gov, filed as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 10-K (File No. 814-00891) filed on November 16, 2022.\nOther\nWe may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.\nWe will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.\nWe are required by law to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office.\nWe and PennantPark Investment Advisers have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws. We review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and we designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes several regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us.\nFor example:\npursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;\npursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;\npursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting; and\npursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated there-under. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and continue to take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act.\nElection to be Treated as a RIC\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements (as described below). We also must annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, out of the assets legally available for distribution, or the Annual Distribution Requirement.\nIn order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we must:\nmaintain an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;\nderive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90% Income Test; and\ndiversify our holdings, or the Diversification Tests, so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:\n1)at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer neither represents more than 5% of the value of our assets nor more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and\n2)no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in certain qualified publicly traded partnerships.\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess, if any, of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gain net income for preceding years that was not distributed during such years and on which we did not incur any federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be taxed as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nWhile we intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to avoid incurring any material U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we generally will be liable for the excise tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. Under certain circumstances, however, we may, in our sole discretion, determine that it is in our best interests to retain a portion of our income or capital gains rather than distribute such amount as dividends and accordingly cause us to bear the excise tax burden associated therewith.\nWe may invest in partnerships which may result in our being subject to additional state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. In addition, some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to mitigate the risk that such income and fees would disqualify us as a RIC as a result of a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through the Taxable Subsidiary, which is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Taxable Subsidiary generally will be subject to corporate income taxes on its earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.\nTaxation as a RIC\nIf we qualify as a RIC, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Additionally, upon satisfying these requirements, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or net capital gains, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, that is not distributed (or not deemed to have been distributed) as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders.\nWe may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold a debt instrument that is treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income in the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.\nWe invest in below investment grade instruments. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless debt instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt instruments in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. We will address these and other issues to the extent necessary in order to continue to maintain our qualification to be subject to tax as a RIC.\nGain or loss realized by us from equity securities and warrants acquired by us, as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants, generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.\nWe are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy our Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt instruments and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain asset coverage requirements are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.\nWe may distribute our common stock as a dividend from our taxable income and a stockholder could receive a portion of such distributions declared and distributed by us in shares of our common stock with the remaining amount in cash. A stockholder will be considered to have recognized dividend income generally equal to the fair market value of the stock paid by us plus cash received with respect to such dividend. The total dividend declared and distributed by us would be taxable income to a stockholder even though only a small portion of the dividend was paid in cash to pay any taxes due on the total dividend. We have not yet elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so.\nFailure to Qualify as a RIC\nIf we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, unless certain cure provisions of the Code apply, we will be subject to tax in that taxable year on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any dividend distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See Election to be Treated as a RIC above for more information.\nIf we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we also would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable as dividends to our stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, U.S. non-corporate stockholders generally would be eligible to treat such dividends as qualified dividend income, which generally would be subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax, and dividends paid by us to certain U.S. corporate stockholders would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholders tax basis in our common stock, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Moreover, if we fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, to qualify again to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to distribute our earnings and profits attributable to any of our non-RIC taxable\nyears as dividends to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years. Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nBefore you invest in our securities, you should be aware of various risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Report, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, our NAV, the trading price of our common stock, our 2023 Notes or any securities we may issue, may decline, and an investor may lose all or part of an investment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE\nWe are subject to various covenants under Funding Is Credit Facility which, if not complied with, could result in reduced availability and/or mandatory prepayments under Funding Is Credit Facility, our 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt.\nIn addition to the asset coverage ratio requirements, the Credit Facility contains various covenants applicable to Funding I, which restricts our ability to borrow funds, and the deed of trust governing our 2023 Notes, the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and the indenture governing our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt contain various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment of the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, respectively. For example, the Credit Facilitys income coverage covenant, or test, requires us to maintain a ratio whereby the aggregate amount of interest received on the portfolio loans must equal at least 125% of the interest payable in respect to the Lenders and other parties. Failure to satisfy the various covenants under the Credit Facility could accelerate repayment under the Credit Facility or otherwise prevent us from receiving distributions under the payment waterfall. This could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Funding Is borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by the assets in Funding Is investment portfolio. The agreements governing the Credit Facility require Funding I to comply with certain financial and operational covenants. These covenants include:\nA requirement to retain our status as a RIC;\nA requirement to maintain a minimum amount of stockholders equity; and\nA requirement that our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility not exceed a certain percentage of the value of our portfolio.\nOur continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. A material decrease in our NAV in connection with additional borrowings could result in an inability to comply with our obligation to restrict the level of indebtedness that we are able to incur in relation to the value of our assets or to maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity in Funding I or to result in the ability of the trustee and our note holders to accelerate amounts due under the deed of trust governing our 2023 Notes, the indenture governing our 2026 Notes or the indenture governing our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations, as it would reduce availability under the Credit Facility and could trigger mandatory prepayment obligations under the terms of the Credit Facility.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.\nA number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. We compete with public and private funds, including other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, CLO funds and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Additionally, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, also invest in middle-market companies. As a result, competition for investment opportunities at middle-market companies can be intense. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives.\nParticipants in our industry compete on several factors, including price, flexibility in transaction structuring, customer service, reputation, market knowledge and speed in decision-making. We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are lower than the rates we offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors pricing, terms and structure. However, if we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.\nOur borrowers may default on their payments, which may have a materially negative effect on our financial performance.\nOur primary business exposes us to credit risk, and the quality of our portfolio has a significant impact on our earnings. Credit risk is a component of our fair valuation of our portfolio companies. Negative credit events will lead to a decrease in the fair value of our portfolio companies.\nIn addition, market conditions have affected consumer confidence levels, which may harm the business of our portfolio companies and result in adverse changes in payment patterns. Increased delinquencies and default rates would negatively impact our results of operations. Deterioration in the credit quality of our portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If interest rates rise, some of our portfolio companies may not be able to pay the escalating interest on our loans and may default.\nWe make long-term loans and debt investments, which may involve a high degree of repayment risk. Our investments with a deferred interest feature, such as OID income and PIK interest, could represent a higher credit risk than investments that must pay interest in full in cash on a regular basis. We invest in companies that may have limited financial resources, typically are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain financing from traditional sources. Accordingly, a general economic downturn or severe tightening in the credit markets could materially impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could significantly damage our business. Numerous other factors may affect a borrowers ability to repay its loan, including the failure to meet its business plan or a downturn in its industry. A portfolio companys failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans or foreclosure on the secured assets. This could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio companys ability to meet its obligations under the loans or debt securities that we hold. In addition, our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks senior to or equally with our securities. This means that payments on such senior-ranking securities may have to be made before we receive any payments on our subordinated loans or debt securities. Deterioration in a borrowers financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in any related collateral and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny unrealized losses we experience on our investment portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution.\nAs a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at fair value, which is derived from a market value or, if no market value is ascertainable or if market value does not reflect the fair value of such investment in the bona fide determination of our board of directors, then we would carry our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation or loss. Unrealized losses of any given portfolio company could be an indication of such companys inability in the future to meet its repayment obligations to us.\nIf the fair value of our portfolio companies reflects unrealized losses that are subsequently realized, we could experience reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods that could materially harm our results of operations and cause a material decline in the value of our publicly traded common stock.\nWe are dependent upon our Investment Advisers key personnel for our future success, and if our Investment Adviser is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if our Investment Adviser loses any member of its management team, our ability to achieve our investment objectives could be significantly harmed.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior investment professionals of our Investment Adviser for our future success. We also depend, to a significant extent, on PennantPark Investment Advisers access to the investment information and deal flow generated by these senior investment professionals and any others that may be hired by PennantPark Investment Advisers. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, the managers of our Investment Adviser evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and monitor our investments. Our future success depends on the continued service of management personnel of our Investment Adviser. The departure of managers of PennantPark Investment Advisers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives. In addition, we can offer no assurance that PennantPark Investment Advisers will remain our Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser has the right, under the Investment Management Agreement, to resign at any time upon 60 days written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not.\nIf our Investment Management Agreement is terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates that may affect our cost of capital and net investment income.\nSince we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds will increase and the interest rate on investments with an interest rate floor will not increase until interest rates exceed the applicable floor, which will reduce our net investment income. We may use interest rate risk management techniques, such as total return swaps and interest rate swaps, in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we have limited experience in entering into hedging transactions and we will initially have to purchase or develop such expertise, which may diminish the actual benefits of any hedging strategy we employ. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information.\nA rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments once the interest rate exceeds the applicable floor. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Adviser with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income.\nGeneral interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our common stock and our rate of return on invested capital. A reduction in interest rates may result in both lower interest rates on new investments and higher repayments on current investments with higher interest rates, which may have an adverse impact on our net investment income. An increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates or are subject to interest rate floors and also could increase our interest expense on the Credit Facility, thereby decreasing our net investment income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock.\nIf general interest rates continue to rise, there is a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. In addition, continued rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide fixed rate loans to our portfolio companies, which could adversely affect our net investment income, as any increases in our cost of borrowed funds would not be accompanied by increased interest income from such fixed-rate investments.\nThe pending discontinuation and replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio or issued by us.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. Since December 31, 2021, all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen LIBOR settings and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings have ceased to be published on a representative basis, and it is anticipated that after June 30, 2023, the overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be published on a representative basis. Although some settings of U.S. dollar LIBOR continue to be published, there is no assurance that LIBOR will continue to exist as a representative rate until June 30, 2023, or at any time thereafter. Some regulators have prohibited the use of any LIBOR benchmarks in new contracts and have required that regulated entities transition existing contracts to another benchmark prior to June 30, 2023. Although settings of such LIBOR benchmarks may continue to be available, such prohibitions and requirements may adversely affect the value of floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio or issued by us.\nAt this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the U.S. Federal Reserve, in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with alternative reference rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR, or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including, but not limited to, the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact the cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments. In addition, SOFR or other replacement rates may fail to gain market acceptance. Any failure of SOFR or alternative reference rates to gain market acceptance could adversely affect the return on, value of and market for securities linked to such rates. The elimination of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with any alternative reference rate, such as SOFR (or an alternative reference rate based on SOFR) or any other changes or reforms to LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market value of and/or transferability of any floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio or issued by us. In addition, certain statutory regimes which cause a legislative transaction away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may apply, e.g., N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law \u00a7 18-401 or the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act to certain floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio or issued by us and could have a material and adverse impact on the value or liquidity of those instruments.\nThe IRS has issued regulations regarding the tax consequences of the transition from LIBOR or another interbank offered rate (IBOR) to a new reference rate in debt instruments and non-debt contracts. Under the regulations, alteration or modification of the terms of a debt instrument to replace an operative rate that uses a discontinued IBOR with a qualified rate (as defined in the regulations) including true up payments equalizing the fair market value of contracts before and after such IBOR transition, to add a qualified rate as a fallback rate to a contract whose operative rate uses a discontinued IBOR or to replace a fallback rate that uses a discontinued IBOR with a qualified rate would not be taxable. The IRS may provide additional guidance, with potential retroactive effect.\nOur financial condition and results of operation depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objectives depends on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on our Investment Advisers ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment selection criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our Investment Advisers structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and our access to financing on acceptable terms. The management team of PennantPark Investment Advisers has substantial responsibilities under our Investment Management Agreement. In order for us to grow, our Investment Adviser will need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. However, we can offer no assurance that any current or future employees will contribute effectively to the work of, or remain associated with, the Investment Adviser. We caution you that the principals of our Investment Adviser or Administrator may also be called upon to provide and currently do provide significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies and other investment vehicles, including other BDCs, which are managed by the Investment Adviser. Such demands on their time may distract them or slow our rate of investment. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on the communications and information systems, including financial and accounting systems, of the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and our external service providers. Any failure or interruption of such systems could cause delays or other problems in our activities. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm (when undertaken, as noted below), may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be significant deficiencies, material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors and lenders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may not replicate the historical performance of other investment companies and funds with which our senior and other investment professionals have been or are affiliated.\nThe 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the investment activities of BDCs. For example, BDCs are required to invest at least 70% of their total assets primarily in securities of U.S. private companies or thinly traded public companies (i.e., public companies with a market capitalization of less than $250 million), cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. These constraints may hinder the Investment Advisers ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objectives. In addition, the investment philosophy and techniques used by the Investment Adviser may differ from those used by other investment companies and funds advised by the Investment Adviser. Accordingly, we can offer no assurance that we will replicate the historical performance of other investment companies and funds with which our senior and other investment professionals have been affiliated, and we caution that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by such other companies.\nAny failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility.\nIf we do not remain a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of RIC tax status would substantially reduce our net assets and income available for debt service and distributions.\nWe have operated and continue to operate so as to maintain our election to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. If we meet the 90% Income Test, the Diversification Tests, and the Annual Distribution Requirement, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level income taxation on income we timely distribute, or are deemed to distribute, as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. We would cease to qualify for such tax treatment if we were unable to comply with these requirements. In addition, we may have difficulty meeting our Annual Distribution Requirement to our stockholders because, in certain cases, we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income. If we fail to qualify as a RIC, we will have to pay corporate-level taxes on all of our income whether or not we distribute it, which would substantially reduce the amount of income available for debt service as well as reduce and/or affect the character and amount of our distributions to our stockholders. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if we do not distribute to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.\nWe may have difficulty paying our Annual Distribution Requirement if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.\nFor federal income tax purposes, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as OID and PIK interest, which represents interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. OID, which could be significant relative to our overall investment assets, and increases in loan balances as a result of PIK interest will be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash, such as amounts attributable to foreign currency transactions. Our investments with a deferred interest feature, such as PIK interest, may represent a higher credit risk than loans for which interest must be paid in full in cash on a regular basis. For example, even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is scheduled to occur upon maturity of the obligation.\nThe part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide PIK or OID interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may have to sell some of our investments at times or prices we would not consider advantageous, or raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may lose our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC and thus be subject to corporate-level income tax.\nLegislation enacted in 2018 allows us to incur additional leverage.\nA BDC has historically been able to issue senior securities, including borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions, only in amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such incurrence or issuance. In March 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA) was enacted which amended the 1940 Act to decrease this percentage from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) for a BDC that has received either stockholder approval or approval of a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of its board of directors of the application of such lower asset coverage ratio to the BDC. On April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved such reduction. As such, we are able to incur additional indebtedness so long as we comply with the applicable disclosure requirement, which may increase the risk of investing in us. Under the 200% minimum asset coverage ratio, we were permitted to borrow up to one dollar for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity and, under the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio, we are permitted to borrow up to two dollars for investment purposes for every one dollar of investor equity. In other words, Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act permits BDCs to potentially increase their debt-to-equity ratio from a maximum of 1-to-1 to a maximum of 2-to-1. In addition, since our base management fee is determined and payable based upon our average adjusted gross assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes, our base management fee expense may increase if we incur additional leverage.\nBecause we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, we may need to raise additional capital to finance our growth. If funds are not available to us, we may need to curtail new investments, and our common stock value could decline.\nIn connection with satisfying the requirements to be subject to tax as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains each taxable year. However, we may retain all or a portion of our net capital gains and incur applicable income taxes with respect thereto and elect to treat such retained net capital gains as deemed dividend distributions to our stockholders.\nAs noted above, on April 5, 2018, our board of directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act), approved a reduction of our asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150%. The asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity). If we incur additional indebtedness under this provision, the risk of investing in us will increase. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this asset coverage test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments or sell additional common stock and, depending on the nature of our leverage, to repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales and repayments may be disadvantageous. In addition, the issuance of additional securities could dilute the percentage ownership of our current stockholders in us.\nWe are partially dependent on our subsidiary Funding I for cash distributions to enable us to meet the distribution requirements in order to permit us to be subject to tax as a RIC. In this regard, Funding I is limited by its covenants from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to fulfill our requirements to be subject to tax as a RIC. In such case, we would need to request a waiver of these covenants restrictions for Funding I to make certain distributions to enable us to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure you that Funding I will be granted such a waiver, and if Funding I is unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the covenants may cause us to incur a corporate-level income tax.\nRegulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.\nOur business requires a substantial amount of capital. We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of additional senior securities or other indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, the issuance of warrants or subscription rights to purchase certain of our securities, or from securitization transactions. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. We may issue debt securities or preferred securities, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, and we may borrow money from banks, or other financial institutions, up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the asset coverage ratio requirements permit us to issue senior securities or incur indebtedness subject to certain limitations. Our ability to pay distributions or issue additional senior securities would be restricted if our asset coverage ratio was not met. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage ratio. If that happens, we may be required to liquidate a portion of our investments and repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSenior Securities. As a result of issuing senior securities, including our 2023 Notes and our 2026 Notes, we are exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred securities, they would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure. Preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights and may have rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of holders of our common stock. Furthermore, the issuance of preferred securities could have the adverse effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stockholders or otherwise be in your best interest. Our senior securities may include conversion features that cause them to bear risks more closely associated with an investment in our common stock.\nAdditional Common Stock. Our board of directors may decide to issue common stock to finance our operations rather than issuing debt or other senior securities. As a BDC, we are generally not able to issue our common stock at a price below NAV per share without first obtaining certain approvals from our stockholders and our board of directors. Also, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, we may issue rights to acquire our common stock at a price below the current NAV per share of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our common stockholders. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. However, when required to be undertaken, the procedures used by the board of directors to determine the NAV per share of our common stock within 48 hours of each offering of our common stock may differ materially from and will necessarily be more abbreviated than the procedures used by the board of directors to determine the NAV per share of our common stock at the end of each quarter because there is an extensive process each quarter to determine the NAV per share of our common stock which cannot be completed in 48 hours. The quarterly process\nincludes preliminary valuation conclusions, engagement of independent valuation firms and review by those firms of preliminary valuation conclusions. By contrast, the procedures in connection with an offering may yield a NAV that is less precise than the NAV determined at the end of each quarter. We will not offer transferable subscription rights to our stockholders at a price equivalent to less than the then current NAV per share of common stock, excluding underwriting commissions, unless we first file a post-effective amendment that is declared effective by the SEC with respect to such issuance and the common stock to be purchased in connection with such rights represents no more than one-third of our outstanding common stock at the time such rights are issued. In addition, for us to file a post-effective amendment to a registration statement on Form N-2, we must then be qualified to register our securities under the requirements of Form S-3. We may actually issue shares above or below a future NAV. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or warrants or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our common stockholders at that time would decrease, and our common stockholders would experience voting dilution.\nSecuritization. As a result of the completion of the Debt Securitization, we are exposed to typical risks associated with the securitization of loans to generate cash for funding new investments. As applicable accounting pronouncements and SEC staff guidance requires us to consolidate the Securitization Issuers financial statements with our financial statements, any debt issued by the Securitization Issuers would be generally treated as if it were issued by us for purposes of the asset coverage ratio applicable to us. We retain all of the equity in the Securitization Issuers and our retained equity would be exposed to any losses on the portfolio of loans before any of the debt securities would be exposed to such losses. Accordingly, if the pool of loans experienced a low level of losses due to defaults, we would earn an incremental amount of income on our retained equity but we would be exposed, up to the amount of equity we retained, to that proportion of any losses we would have experienced if we had continued to hold the loans in our portfolio.\nWe currently use borrowed funds to make investments and are exposed to the typical risks associated with leverage.\nBecause we borrow funds to make investments, we are exposed to increased risk of loss due to our use of debt to make investments. A decrease in the value of our investments will have a greater negative impact on the NAV attributable to our common stock than it would if we did not use debt. Our ability to pay distributions may be restricted when our asset coverage ratio is not met and any cash that we use to service our indebtedness is not available for distribution to our common stockholders.\nOur current debt is governed by the terms of the Credit Facility, the deed of trust governing the 2023 Notes, the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and the indenture governing the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, and future debt may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. We, and indirectly our stockholders, bear the cost of issuing and servicing debt. Any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may also carry leverage related risks. Leverage magnifies the potential risks for loss and the risks of investing in us, both as detailed below.\nIf we incur additional debt, it could increase the risk of investing in our shares.\nWe have indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the Credit Facility, 2023 Notes, 2026 Notes and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt and expect in the future to borrow additional amounts under the Credit Facility or other debt securities, subject to market availability, and, may increase the size of the Credit Facility. We cannot assure you that our leverage will remain at current levels. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend upon our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Lenders have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders or preferred stockholders, if any, and we have granted a security interest in Funding Is assets in connection with the Credit Facility borrowings. In the case of a liquidation event, those lenders would receive proceeds before our stockholders. Any future debt issuance will increase our leverage and may be subordinate to the Credit Facility. In addition, borrowings or debt issuances, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for loss or gain on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. If the value of our assets decreases, then the use of leverage would cause the NAV attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not utilized leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our revenue would cause our net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common or preferred stock. Our ability to service any debt that we incur depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures.\nAs noted above, on April 5, 2018, our board of directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act), and our stockholders, respectively, approved a reduction of our asset coverage ratio. As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% to 150%, so long as we comply with the applicable disclosure requirements, which may increase the risk of investing in us.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 178% and 175%, respectively. Since our leverage was 128% and 138% of our net assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, we would have to receive an annual return of at least 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively, to cover annual interest payments.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of $168.8 million under the Credit Facility, $97.0 million outstanding under our 2023 Notes, $185.0 million under our 2026 Notes, and $228.0 million outstanding under the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. Our consolidated debt outstanding was $678.8 million and had a weighted average annual interest rate at the time of 4.5%, exclusive of the fees on the undrawn commitment on the Credit Facility. This example is for illustrative purposes only, and actual interest rates on the Credit Facility or any future borrowings are likely to fluctuate. The costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the management fee or incentive fee payable to our Investment Adviser, are and will be borne by our stockholders.\nThe following table is designed to illustrate the effect on the return to a holder of our common stock of the leverage created by our use of borrowing as of September 30, 2022 of 54.7% of total assets (including such borrowed funds), at the current interest rate at the time of 3.9%, and assumes hypothetical annual returns on our portfolio of minus 10 to plus 10 percent. The table also assumes that we will maintain a constant level of leverage and weighted average interest rate. The amount of leverage and cost of borrowing that we use will vary from time to time. As can be seen, leverage generally increases the return to stockholders when the portfolio return is positive and decreases return when the portfolio return is negative. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table.\nAssumed return on portfolio (net of expenses) (1)\n(10.0\n)%\n(5.0\n)%\n%\n5.0\n%\n10.0\n%\nCorresponding return to common stockholders (2)\n(28.2\n)%\n(16.6\n)%\n(5.0\n)%\n6.6\n%\n18.3\n%\n(1)The assumed portfolio return is required by regulation of the SEC and is not a prediction of, and does not represent, our projected or actual performance.\n(2)In order to compute the corresponding return to common stockholders, the assumed return on portfolio is multiplied by the total value of our assets at the beginning of the period to obtain an assumed return to us. From this amount, all interest expense expected to be accrued during the period is subtracted to determine the return available to stockholders. The return available to stockholders is then divided by the total value of our net assets as of the beginning of the period to determine the corresponding return to common stockholders.\nWe may in the future determine to fund a portion of our investments with preferred stock, which is another form of leverage and would magnify the potential for loss and the risks of investing in us.\nPreferred stock, which is another form of leverage, has the same risks to our common stockholders as borrowings because the distributions on any preferred stock we issue must be cumulative. If we issue preferred securities they would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure. Payment of distributions on, and repayment of the liquidation preference of, such preferred stock would typically take preference over any distributions or other payments to our common stockholders. Also, preferred stockholders are not typically subject to any of our expenses or losses and are not entitled to participate in any income or appreciation in excess of their stated preference. Furthermore, preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights and may have rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of our common stockholders. Also, the issuance of preferred securities could have the adverse effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stockholders or otherwise be in the best interest of stockholders.\nWe may in the future determine to fund a portion of our investments with debt securities, which would magnify the potential for loss and the risks of investing in us.\nAs a result of any issuance of debt securities and borrowings under the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, we would be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss and an increase in expenses, which are ultimately borne by our common stockholders. Payment of interest on such debt securities must take preference over any other distributions or other payments to our common stockholders. If we issue additional debt securities in the future, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. In addition, such securities may be rated by rating agencies, and in obtaining a rating for such securities, we may be required to abide by operating and investment guidelines that could further restrict our operating flexibility. Furthermore, any cash that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for the payment of distributions to our common stockholders.\nOur credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our debt securities.\nOur credit ratings, if any, are an assessment of our ability to pay our obligations. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of any publicly issued debt securities. Our credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks related to market conditions or other factors discussed above on the market value of, or trading market for, any publicly issued debt securities. Rating agencies have reviewed, and may continue to review, our credit ratings and those of other business development companies in light of the SBCAA as well as any corresponding changes to asset coverage ratios and, in certain cases, downgrade such ratings. Such a downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our securities.\nMarket conditions may make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Credit Facility expires in August 2026. We utilize proceeds from the Credit Facility to make investments in our portfolio companies. The duration of many of our investments exceeds the duration of our indebtedness under the Credit Facility. This means that we will have to extend the maturity of the Credit Facility or refinance our indebtedness under the Credit Facility in order to avoid selling investments at maturity of the Credit Facility, at which time such sales may be at prices that are disadvantageous to us, which could materially damage our business. In addition, future market conditions may affect our ability to renew or refinance the Credit Facility on terms as favorable as those in our existing Credit Facility. If we fail to extend or refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility by the time it becomes due and payable, the administrative agent of the Credit Facility may elect to exercise various remedies, including the sale of all or a portion of the collateral securing the Credit Facility, subject to certain restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments. If we are required to sell our investments on short-term notice, we may not receive the value that we have recorded for such investments, and this could materially affect our results of operations.\nWe may not receive cash on our equity interests from Funding I.\nExcept for management fees that PennantPark Investment Advisers has irrevocably directed to be paid to us, we receive cash from Funding I only to the extent that we receive distributions on our equity interests in Funding I. Funding I may make equity distributions on such interests only to the extent permitted by the payment priority provisions of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility generally provides that payments on such interests may not be made on any payment date unless all amounts owing to the Lenders and other secured parties are paid in full. In the event that we fail to receive cash from Funding I, we could be unable to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We also could be forced to sell investments in portfolio companies at less than their fair value in order to continue making such distributions.\nThere are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns.\nThe professionals of the Investment Adviser and Administrator may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by affiliates of us that currently exist or may be formed in the future. The Investment Adviser and Administrator may be engaged by such funds at any time and without the prior approval of our stockholders or our board of directors. Our board of directors monitors any potential conflict that may arise upon such a development. Accordingly, if this occurs, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Currently, the executive officers and directors, as well as the current senior investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, may serve as officers and directors of our affiliated funds. In addition, we note that any affiliated investment vehicles currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Although the Investment Adviser will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, it is possible that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment funds managed by the Investment Adviser or an investment manager affiliated with the Investment Adviser. In any such case, when the Investment Adviser identifies an investment, it is forced to choose which investment fund should make the investment. We may co-invest on a concurrent basis with any other affiliates that the Investment Adviser currently has or forms in the future, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, our exemptive relief and our allocation procedures.\nIn the ordinary course of our investing activities, we pay investment advisory and incentive fees to the Investment Adviser, and reimburse the Investment Adviser for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in a lower rate of return than an investor might achieve through direct investments. Accordingly, there may be times when the management team of the Investment Adviser has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict. For example, the Investment Adviser may seek to invest in more speculative investments in order to increase its incentive fee, which practice could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.\nWe have entered into the License Agreement with PennantPark Investment Advisers, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser has agreed to grant us a royalty-free non-exclusive license to use the name PennantPark. The License Agreement will expire (i) upon expiration or termination of the Investment Management Agreement, (ii) if the Investment Adviser ceases to serve as our investment adviser, (iii) by either party upon 60 days written notice or (iv) by the Investment Adviser at any time in the event we assign or attempt to assign or sublicense the License Agreement or any of our rights or duties thereunder without the prior written consent of the Investment Adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the PennantPark name.\nIn addition, we pay PennantPark Investment Administration, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser, our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by PennantPark Investment Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. These arrangements may create conflicts of interest that our board of directors must monitor.\nWe are subject to risks associated with cybersecurity and cyber incidents.\nOur business relies on secure information technology systems. These systems are subject to potential attacks, including through adverse events that threaten the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources (i.e., cyber incidents). These attacks could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption and result in disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by the Investment Adviser and third-party service providers. We, along with our Investment Adviser, have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of the risk of a cyber incident, may be ineffective and do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. In addition, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Furthermore, cybersecurity continues to be a key priority for regulators around the world, and some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. If we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses, a disruption of our businesses, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nWe could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in, and the timing of the recognition of, realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. However, as a result of our irrevocable election to apply the fair value option to the Credit Facility, future decreases of fair value of our debt is expected to have a corresponding increase to our NAV. Similarly, future increases in the fair value of our debt may have a corresponding decrease to our NAV. Any future indebtedness that we elect the fair value option for may have similar effects on our NAV as the Credit Facility. This is expected to mitigate volatility in our earnings and NAV. As a result, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of future performance.\nWe may in the future issue securities for which there is no public market and for which we expect no public market to develop.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may issue debt or other securities for which no public market exists, and for which no public market is expected to develop. If we issue shares of our common stock as a component of a unit security, we would expect the common stock to separate from the other securities in such unit after a period of time or upon occurrence of an event and to trade publicly on The New York Stock Exchange and the TASE, which may cause volatility in our publicly traded common stock. To the extent we issue securities for which no public market exists and for which no public market develops, a purchaser of such securities may not be able to liquidate the investment without considerable delay, if at all. If a market should develop for our debt and other securities, the price may be highly volatile, and our debt and other securities may lose value.\nIf we issue preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt securities the NAV and market value of our common stock may become more volatile.\nWe cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock and/or debt securities would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, debt securities and/or convertible debt would likely cause the NAV and market value of our common stock to become more volatile. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of our common stock would be reduced or entirely eliminated. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued the preferred stock or debt securities. Any decline in the NAV of our investment would be borne entirely by the holders of our common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in NAV to the holders of our common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt. This decline in NAV would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for our common stock.\nThere is also a risk that, in the event of a sharp decline in the value of our net assets, we would be in danger of failing to maintain required asset coverage ratios or other covenants which may be required by the preferred stock, debt securities and/or convertible debt or risk a downgrade in the ratings of the preferred stock, debt securities and/or convertible debt or our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the dividend requirements on the preferred stock or the interest payments on the debt securities. In order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund redemption of some or all of the preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of our common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or any combination of these securities. Holders of preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or any combination of these securities may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our business.\nThe ability to sell investments held by Funding I is limited.\nThe Credit Facility places restrictions on the collateral managers ability to sell investments. As a result, there may be times or circumstances during which the collateral manager is unable to sell investments or take other actions that might be in our best interests.\nThe trading market or market value of any publicly issued debt or convertible debt securities may be volatile.\nIf we publicly issue debt or convertible debt securities, they initially will not have an established trading market. We cannot assure investors that a trading market for our publicly issued debt or convertible debt securities would develop or be maintained if developed. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors may have a material adverse effect on the trading market for, and market value of, our publicly issued debt or convertible debt securities.\nThese factors include the following:\nthe time remaining to the maturity of these debt securities;\nthe outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical or similar to these debt securities;\nthe supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market, if any;\nthe redemption, repayment or convertible features, if any, of these debt securities;\nthe level, direction and volatility of market interest rates; and\nmarket rates of interest higher or lower than rates borne by the debt securities.\nThere also may be a limited number of buyers for our debt securities. This too may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the debt securities or the trading market for the debt securities. Our debt securities may include convertible features that cause them to more closely bear risks associated with an investment in our common stock.\nTerms relating to debt redemption may have a material adverse effect on the return on any debt securities.\nIf we issue debt securities that are redeemable at our option, we may choose to redeem the debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities. In addition, if the debt securities are subject to mandatory redemption, we may be required to redeem the debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities. In this circumstance, a holder of our debt securities may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the debt securities being redeemed.\nIf we issue subscription rights or warrants for our common stock, your interest in us may be diluted as a result of such rights or warrants offering.\nStockholders who do not fully exercise rights or warrants issued to them in an offering of subscription rights or warrants to purchase our common stock should expect that they will, at the completion of an offering, own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their rights or warrants. We cannot state precisely the amount of any such dilution in share ownership because we do not know what proportion of the common stock would be purchased as a result of any such offering.\nIn addition, if the subscription price or warrant exercise price is less than our NAV per share of common stock at the time of an offering, then our stockholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate NAV of their shares as a result of the offering. The amount of any such decrease in NAV is not predictable because it is not known at this time what the subscription price, warrant exercise price or NAV per share will be on the expiration date of such rights offering or what proportion of our common stock will be purchased as a result of any such offering.\nThe impact of recent financial reform legislation on us is uncertain.\nIn light of current conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets and the U.S. and global economy, legislators, the presidential administration and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, institutes a wide range of reforms that will have an impact on financial institutions. Legislation may be adopted that could significantly affect the regulation of U.S. financial markets. Areas subject to potential change, amendment or repeal include the Dodd-Frank Act and the authority of the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. These or other regulatory changes could result in greater competition from banks and other lenders with which we compete for lending and other investment opportunities. Accordingly, we are continuing to evaluate the effect the Dodd-Frank Act or implementing its regulations or any repeal or revision thereto will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States may also potentially withdraw from or renegotiate various trade agreements and take other actions that would change current trade policies of the United States. We cannot predict which, if any, of these actions will be taken or, if taken, their effect on the financial stability of the United States. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations or those of our portfolio companies may adversely affect our business.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to laws and regulation at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations that govern our operations or those of our portfolio companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Business-Regulation for more information.\nOur board of directors may change our investment objectives, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.\nOur board of directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval (except as required by the 1940 Act). However, absent stockholder approval, under the 1940 Act, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our common stock. Nevertheless, the effects may adversely affect our business and impact our ability to make distributions.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder the execution of our investment strategy or impact our stock price.\nStockholder activism, which could take many forms, including making public demands that we consider certain strategic alternatives, engaging in public campaigns to attempt to influence our corporate governance and/or our management, and commencing proxy contests to attempt to elect the activists representatives or others to our board of directors, or arise in a variety of situations, has impacted the BDC space. While we are currently not subject to any stockholder activism, due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may in the future become the target of stockholder activism. Stockholder activism could result in substantial costs and divert managements and our board of directors attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and adversely affect our relationships with service providers and our portfolio companies. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal and other expenses related to any activist stockholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE ILLIQUID NATURE OF OUR PORTFOLIO ASSETS\nWe invest in illiquid assets, and our valuation procedures with respect to such assets may result in recording values that are materially different than the values we ultimately receive upon disposition of such assets.\nAll of our investments are recorded using broker or dealer quotes, if available, or at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. We expect that most, if not all, of our investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) and the fair value of the Credit Facility will be classified as Level 3 under the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. This means that the portfolio valuations will be based on unobservable inputs and our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. We expect that inputs into the determination of fair values of our portfolio investments and Credit Facility borrowings will require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data are available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by such a disclaimer materially reduces the reliability of such information. As a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.\nDetermining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. In determining fair value in good faith, we generally obtain financial and other information from portfolio companies, which may represent unaudited, projected or pro forma financial information. Unlike banks, we are not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated\nloan losses; we are instead required by the 1940 Act to specifically fair value each individual investment on a quarterly basis. We record unrealized appreciation if we believe that our investment has appreciated in value. Likewise, we record unrealized depreciation if we believe that our investment has depreciated in value. We adjust quarterly the valuation of our portfolio to reflect our board of directors determination of the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. Any changes in fair value are recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\nAll of our investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Our board of directors uses the services of nationally recognized independent valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of our investments. The factors that may be considered in fair value pricing of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies and other relevant factors. Because valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the value received in an actual transaction. Additionally, valuations of private securities and private companies are inherently uncertain. Our NAV could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially lower than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\nWe may acquire our investments directly from the issuer in privately negotiated transactions. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. We typically exit our investments when the portfolio company has a liquidity event such as a sale, refinancing, or initial public offering of the company, but we are generally not required to do so.\nThe illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult or impossible for us to sell such investments if the need arises, particularly at times when the market for illiquid securities is substantially diminished. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.\nInvestments purchased by us that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer of the investments, market events, economic conditions or investor perceptions. Domestic and foreign markets are complex and interrelated, so that events in one sector of the world markets or economy, or in one geographical region, can reverberate and have materially negative consequences for other market, economic or regional sectors in a manner that may not be foreseen and which may materially harm our business.\nA general disruption in the credit markets could materially damage our business.\nWe are susceptible to the risk of significant loss if we are forced to discount the value of our investments in order to provide liquidity to meet our debt maturities. Funding Is borrowings under its Credit Facility are collateralized by the assets in our investment portfolio. A general disruption in the credit markets could result in diminished demand for our securities. In addition, with respect to over-the-counter traded securities, the continued viability of any over-the-counter secondary market depends on the continued willingness of dealers and other participants to purchase the securities.\nIf the fair value of our assets declines substantially, we may fail to maintain the asset coverage ratio stipulated by the 1940 Act, which could, in turn, cause us to lose our status as a BDC and materially impair our business operations. Our liquidity could be impaired further by an inability to access the capital markets or to draw down Funding Is Credit Facility. These situations may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general disruption in the credit markets, a severe decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, an economic downturn or recession or an operational problem that affects our counterparties or us, and could materially damage our business.\nWe may invest in over-the-counter securities, which have and may continue to face liquidity constraints, to provide us with liquidity.\nThe market for over-the-counter traded securities has and may continue to experience limited liquidity and other weakness as the viability of any over-the-counter secondary market depends on the continued willingness of dealers and other participants to purchase the securities.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENTS\nOur investments in prospective portfolio companies may be risky, and an investor could lose all or part of an investment.\nWe intend to invest primarily in floating rate loans, which may consist of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and selected equity investments issued by U.S. middle-market companies.\n1.Floating Rate Loans: The floating rate loans we invest in are usually rated below investment grade or may also be unrated. Investments in floating rate loans rated below investment grade are considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such companies are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to us, and such defaults could reduce our NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher default rate by portfolio companies. A rloating rate loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs and we may experience losses due to the inherent illiquidity of the investments. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a floating rate loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the floating rate loans fair value. Floating rate loans are subject to a number of risks, including liquidity risk and the risk of investing in below investment grade, variable-rate securities.\nFloating rate loans are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal. Such non-payment would result in a reduction of income to us, a reduction in the fair value of the investment and a potential decrease in our NAV. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of any collateral securing a floating rate loan would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal payments, or that the collateral could be readily liquidated. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of a borrower, we could experience delays or limitations with respect to our ability to realize the benefits of the collateral securing a floating rate loan. The collateral securing a floating rate loan may lose all or substantially all of its value in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a borrower. Some loans are subject to the risk that a court, pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws, could subordinate the rights in collateral of such loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other actions detrimental to the holders of loans including, in certain circumstances, invalidating such loans or causing interest previously paid to be refunded to the borrower. Either such action could materially negatively affect our performance.\nWe may acquire floating rate loans through assignments or participations of interests in such loans. The purchaser of an assignment typically succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the assigning institution and becomes a lender under the credit agreement with respect to such debt obligation. However, the purchasers rights can be more restricted than those of the assigning institution, and we may not be able to unilaterally enforce all rights and remedies under an assigned debt obligation and with regard to any associated collateral. A participation typically results in a contractual relationship only with the institution participating out the interest and not directly with the borrower. Sellers of participations typically include banks, broker-dealers, other financial institutions and lending institutions. In purchasing participations, we generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan\nagreement against the borrower, and we may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the debt obligation in which we have purchased the participation. As a result, we will be exposed to the credit risk of both the borrower and the institution selling the participation. Further, in purchasing participations in lending syndicates, we will not be able to conduct the same level of due diligence on a borrower or the quality of the floating rate loan with respect to which we are buying a participation as we would conduct if we were investing directly in the floating rate loan. This difference may result in us being exposed to greater credit or fraud risk with respect to such floating rate loans than we expected when initially purchasing the participation. Floating rate loans can be first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt.\n2.First Lien Secured Debt: When we extend first lien secured debt, we will generally take a security interest in the available assets of these portfolio companies, including the equity interests of their subsidiaries, although this may not always be the case. We expect this security interest, if any, to help mitigate the risk that we will not be repaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital. Also, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio companys financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a first lien secured debt investment is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loans terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies.\n3.Second Lien Secured Debt: Our second lien secured debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt. Second lien secured debt holds a second priority with regard to right of payment in the event of insolvency. Second lien secured debt ranks senior to subordinated debt and common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. This may result in an above average amount of risk and volatility or a loss of principal. These investments may involve additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. To the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt may be subject to greater fluctuations in valuations, and such debt could subject us and our stockholders to non-cash income. Since we may not receive cash interest or principal prior to the maturity of some of our second lien secured debt investments, such investments may be of greater risk than cash paying loans.\n4.Subordinated Debt: Our subordinated debt usually ranks junior in priority of payment to first lien secured debt and second lien secured debt, and are often unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. Subordinated debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in borrowers capital structures. This may result in an above average amount of risk and volatility or a loss of principal. These investments may involve additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. To the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt may be subject to greater fluctuations in valuations, and such debt could subject us and our stockholders to non-cash income. Since we may not receive cash interest or principal prior to the maturity of some of our subordinated debt investments, such investments may be of greater risk than cash paying loans.\n5.Equity Investments: We have made and expect to continue to make select equity investments, all of which are subordinated to debt investments. In addition, when we invest in first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, we may acquire warrants to purchase equity investments from time to time. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of these equity investments and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity investments we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity investments, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity investments may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. In addition, many of the equity securities in which we invest may not pay dividends on a regular basis, if at all. Furthermore, we may hold equity investments in partnerships through a taxable subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. Upon sale or exit of such investment, we may pay taxes at regular corporate tax rates, which will reduce the amount of gains or dividends available for distributions to our stockholders.\nIn addition, investing in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks, including:\ncompanies may be highly leveraged, have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;\nthey typically have shorter operating histories, more limited publicly available information, narrower product lines, more concentration of revenues from customers and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;\nthey are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;\nthey generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. In addition, our executive officers, directors and our Investment Adviser may be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies; and\nthey may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to refinance their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity.\nUnder the 1940 Act, we may invest up to 30% of our assets in investments that are not qualifying assets for BDCs. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could be precluded from investing in assets that we deem to be attractive.\nAs a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than qualifying assets, as defined under the 1940 Act, unless at the time the acquisition is made such qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the value of our total assets. Qualifying assets include investments in U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange and companies listed on a national securities exchange subject to a maximum market capitalization of $250 million. Qualifying assets also include cash, cash equivalents, government securities and high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.\nWe believe that most of our debt and equity investments do and will constitute qualifying assets. However, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we have not invested a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets at the time of a proposed investment, we will be prohibited from making any additional investment that is not a qualifying asset and could be forced to forgo attractive investment opportunities. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to comply with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it would be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. For example, we may have difficulty in finding a buyer and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss.\nWe are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we generally are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer.\nWe are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, which means that we are not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer, excluding limitations on investments in other investment companies and compliance with the RIC tax regulations. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers, our NAV may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the markets assessment of the issuer. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company. Beyond the Diversification Requirements, we do not have fixed guidelines for portfolio diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies or industries. Although we are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, we maintain the flexibility to operate as a diversified investment company and have done so for an extended period of time. To the extent that we operate as a non-diversified investment company in the future, we may be subject to greater risk.\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.\nMany of our portfolio companies are susceptible to economic or industry centric slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay debt from us during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our debt investments and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a material decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and materially harm our operating results.\nA portfolio companys failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and potential termination of its debt and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio companys ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company, and any restructuring could further cause adverse effects on our business. Depending on the facts and circumstances of our investments and the extent of our involvement in the management of a portfolio company, upon the bankruptcy of a portfolio company, a bankruptcy court may recharacterize our debt investments as equity investments and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. This could occur regardless of how we may have structured our investment. In addition, we cannot assure you that a bankruptcy court would not take actions contrary to our interests.\nIf we fail to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies, this could materially impair the value of our portfolio.\nFollowing an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as follow-on investments, in order to:\nincrease or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage;\nexercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or\nattempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.\nWe have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources and regulatory considerations. We may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. Any failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful transaction or business. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, either because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements or the desire to maintain our RIC tax status.\nBecause we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we are not in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.\nBecause we generally do not hold controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company, and may therefore suffer a decrease in the market value of our investments.\nAn investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies, including controlling equity interests, presents certain challenges, including the lack of available or comparable information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.\nWe have invested and intend to continue to invest primarily in privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we rely on the ability of our Investment Advisers investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If they are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose value on our investments. Also, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our investment returns as compared to companies investing primarily in the securities of public companies.\nOur portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies and our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged.\nWe invest primarily in floating rate loans issued by our portfolio companies. The portfolio companies usually will have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments, and they may be highly leveraged. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to our debt investments. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, the portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.\nOur incentive fee may induce the Investment Adviser to make speculative investments.\nThe incentive fee payable by us to PennantPark Investment Advisers may create an incentive for PennantPark Investment Advisers to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The incentive fee payable to our Investment Adviser is calculated based on a percentage of our NAV. This may encourage our Investment Adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain\ncircumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor the holders of our common stock. In addition, our Investment Adviser will receive the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike that portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, the Investment Adviser may have a tendency to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.\nThe part of our incentive fee payable by us to PennantPark Investment Advisers that relates to net investment income is computed and paid on income that has been accrued but that has not been received in cash. PennantPark Investment Advisers is not obligated to reimburse us for any such incentive fees even if we subsequently incur losses or never receive in cash the deferred income that was previously accrued. As a result, there is a risk that we will pay incentive fees with respect to income that we never receive in cash.\nAny investments in distressed debt may not produce income and may require us to bear large expenses in order to protect and recover our investment.\nDistressed debt investments may not produce income and may require us to bear certain additional expenses in order to protect and recover our investment. Therefore, to the extent we invest in distressed debt, our ability to achieve current income for our stockholders may be diminished. We also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when, in what manner and for what value the distressed debt in which we invest will eventually be satisfied (e.g., through liquidation of the obligors assets, an exchange offer or plan of reorganization involving the distressed debt securities or a payment of some amount in satisfaction of the obligation). In addition, even if an exchange offer is made or plan of reorganization is adopted with respect to distressed debt we hold, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by us in connection with such exchange offer or plan of reorganization will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated when the investment was made. Moreover, any securities received by us upon completion of an exchange offer or plan of reorganization may be restricted as to resale. If we participate in negotiations with respect to any exchange offer or plan of reorganization with respect to an issuer of distressed debt, we may be restricted from disposing of such securities.\nOur investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.\nOur investment strategy contemplates potential investments in securities of companies located outside of the United States. Investments in securities of companies located outside the United States would not be qualifying assets under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Investing in companies located outside of the United States may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political, economic and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility.\nAlthough most of our investments will be U.S. dollar-denominated, any investments denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and economic and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques such as using the Credit Facilitys multicurrency capability to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk or, that if we do, such strategies will be effective.\nWe may make investments that cause our stockholders to bear investment advisory fees and other expenses on such investments in addition to our management fees and expenses.\nWe may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies and companies that would be investment companies but are excluded from the definition of an investment company provided in Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act. To the extent we so invest, we will bear our ratable share of any such investment companys expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay investment advisory fees, consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee, to PennantPark Investment Advisers with respect to investments in the securities and instruments of other investment companies under our Investment Management Agreement. With respect to any such investments, each of our stockholders will bear his or her share of the investment advisory fees of PennantPark Investment Advisers as well as indirectly bearing the investment advisory fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which we invest.\nWe may be obligated to pay our Investment Adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a loss.\nOur Investment Adviser is entitled to incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of our investment income for that quarter (before deducting incentive compensation, net operating losses and certain other items) above a threshold return for that quarter. Our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for incentive compensation purposes excludes realized and unrealized capital losses that we may incur in the fiscal quarter, even if such capital losses result in a net loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for that quarter. Thus, we may be required to pay the Investment Adviser incentive compensation for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio, NAV or we incur a net loss for that quarter. In addition, increases in interest rates may increase the amount of incentive fees we pay to the Investment Adviser even though our performance relative to the market has not increased.\nWe may invest in derivatives or other assets that expose us to certain risks, including market risk, liquidity risk and other risks similar to those associated with the use of leverage.\nThe Company may invest in derivatives and other assets that are subject to many of the same types of risks related to the use of leverage. In October 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act regarding the ability of a BDC to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations. Under Rule 18f-4, BDCs that use derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined under Rule 18f-4. Under Rule 18f-4, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement (which may include delayed draw and revolving loans) that will not be deemed to a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Collectively, these requirements may limit the Companys ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts.\nThe Company has adopted updated policies and procedures in compliance with Rule 18f-4. The Company expects to qualify as a limited derivatives user. Future legislation or rules may modify how the Company treats derivatives and other financial arrangements for purposes of the Companys compliance with the leverage limitations of the 1940 Act. Future legislation or rules, may modify how leverage is calculated under the 1940 Act and, therefore, may increase or decrease the amount of leverage currently available to the Company under the 1940 Act, which may be materially adverse to the Company and the Companys Investors.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe may obtain the approval of our stockholders to issue shares of our common stock at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock. If we receive such approval from stockholders in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV per share of common stock. Any such issuance could materially dilute your interest in our common stock and reduce our NAV per share.\nWe may seek to obtain from our stockholders and they may approve a proposal that authorizes us to issue shares of our common stock at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for a 12-month period. Such approval would allow us to access the capital markets in a way that we were previously unable to do as a result of restrictions that, absent stockholder approval, apply to BDCs under the 1940 Act.\nAny sale or other issuance of shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per share will result in an immediate dilution to your interest in our common stock and a reduction of our NAV per share. This dilution would occur as a result of a proportionately greater decrease in a stockholders interest in our earnings and assets and voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. Because the number of future shares of common stock that may be issued below our NAV per share and the price and timing of such issuances are not currently known, we cannot predict the actual dilutive effect of any such issuance. We also cannot determine the resulting reduction in our NAV per share of any such issuance at this time. We caution you that such effects may be material, and we undertake to describe all the material risks and dilutive effects of any offerings we make at a price below our then current NAV in the future in a prospectus supplement issued in connection with any such offering.\nThe determination of NAV in connection with an offering of shares of common stock will involve the determination by our board of directors or a committee thereof that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or otherwise in violation of the 1940 Act, unless we have previously received the consent of the majority of our common stockholders to do so and the board of directors decides such an offering is in the best interests of our common stockholders. Whenever we do not have current stockholder approval to issue shares of our common stock at a price per share below our then current NAV per share, the offering price per share (after any distributing commission or discount) will equal or exceed our then current NAV per share, based on the value of our portfolio securities and other assets determined in good faith by our board of directors as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale.\nThere is a risk that our stockholders may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time.\nWe intend to make distributions on a monthly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage ratio requirements applicable to us as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. Further, we may be forced to liquidate some of our investments and raise cash in order to make distribution payments, which could materially harm our business. Finally, to the extent we make distributions to stockholders which include a return of capital, that portion of the distribution essentially constitutes a return of the stockholders investment. Although such return of capital may not be taxable, such distributions may increase an investors tax liability for capital gains upon the future sale of our common stock.\nInvesting in our shares may involve an above average degree of risk.\nThe investments we make in accordance with our investment objectives may result in a higher amount of risk and volatility than alternative investment options or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive and, therefore, an investment in our shares may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.\nSales of substantial amounts of our securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nSales of substantial amounts of our securities, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our securities. If this occurs and continues it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.\nWe may allocate the net proceeds from any offering of our securities in ways with which you may not agree.\nWe have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of any offering of our securities and may use the net proceeds from an offering in ways with which you may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering.\nOur shares may trade at discounts from NAV or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term.\nShares of BDCs may trade at a market price that is less than the NAV that is attributable to those shares. Our shares have traded above and below our NAV. Our shares closed on The New York Stock Exchange at $9.60 and $12.79 on September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our NAV per share was $11.62 and $12.62 as of the same dates, respectively. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our shares will trade at, above or below NAV in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;\nchanges in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs or BDCs;\nany loss of our BDC or RIC status;\nchanges in earnings or variations in operating results;\nchanges in prevailing interest rates;\nchanges in the value of our portfolio of investments;\nany shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\nthe inability of our Investment Adviser to employ additional experienced investment professionals or the departure of any of the Investment Advisers key personnel;\noperating performance of companies comparable to us;\ngeneral national and international economic trends and other external factors;\ngeneral price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets, including as a result of short sales;\nconversion features of subscription rights, warrants or convertible debt; and\nloss of a major funding source.\nSince our initial listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market to our voluntarily withdrawal of the principal listing of common shares from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC effective at market close on April 13, 2022 and subsequent listing and trading of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, which commenced April 14, 2022, our shares of common stock have traded at a wide range of prices. We can offer no assurance that our shares of common stock will not display similar volatility in future periods.\nWe may be unable to invest the net proceeds raised from offerings on acceptable terms, which would harm our financial condition and operating results.\nUntil we identify new investment opportunities, we intend to either invest the net proceeds of future offerings in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less or use the net proceeds from such offerings to reduce then-outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility or any future credit facility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find enough appropriate investments that meet our investment selection criteria or that any investment we complete using the proceeds from an offering will produce a sufficient return.\nThere is a risk that our common stockholders may receive our stock as distributions in which case they may be required to pay taxes in excess of the cash they receive.\nWe may distribute our common stock as a dividend of our taxable income and a stockholder could receive a portion of the dividends declared and distributed by us in shares of our common stock with the remaining amount in cash. Revenue Procedures issued by the IRS allow a publicly offered regulated investment company (including a BDC) to distribute its own stock as a dividend for the purpose of fulfilling its distribution requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20% of such dividend) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a stockholder will be considered to have recognized dividend income generally equal to the fair market value of the stock paid by us plus cash received with respect to such dividend. The total dividend declared would be taxable income to a stockholder even though he or she may only receive a relatively small portion of the dividend in cash to pay any taxes due on the dividend. We have not elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so.\nProvisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nThe Maryland General Corporation Law, our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of us or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, or the Business Combination Act, the application of which is subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.\nIn addition, our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our common stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from such act, it may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws require us to consult with the SEC staff before we repeal such exemption. Also, our charter provides for classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorize our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue.\nThese anti-takeover provisions may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR DEBT SECURITIES\nRisks Relating to Our 2023 Notes\nThe 2023 are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future.\nThe 2023 Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the 2023 Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2023 Notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had $168.8 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Funding I, and the indebtedness under the Credit Facility is therefore effectively senior in right of payment to the 2023 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets.\nThe 2023 Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe 2023 Notes are obligations exclusively of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is or acts as a guarantor of the 2023 Notes and the 2023 Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future.\nExcept to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries) will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2023 Notes Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the 2023 Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise.\nThe 2023 Notes are linked to the U.S. Dollar and therefore holders of the 2023 Notes are subject to currency risk.\nPayments of principal and interest under the 2023 Notes will be adjusted for increases or decreases in the representative exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to the New Israeli Shekel, or NIS, from the time of the public offering of the 2023 Notes. Accordingly, if such exchange rate declines, the rate of interest holders of the 2023 Notes receive in NIS terms effectively will be lower than the stated interest rate of the 2023 Notes and they will be entitled to receive fewer NIS upon repayment of the 2023 Notes than the par value thereof.\nIf an active trading market does not develop for the 2023 Notes holders of the 2023 Notes may not be able to sell them.\nThe 2023 Notes may trade at a discount to their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, our financial condition or other relevant factors. We cannot assure holders of the 2023 Notes that a liquid trading market will develop for the 2023 Notes, that they will be able to sell their 2023 Notes at a particular time or that the price they receive when they sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not develop, the liquidity and trading price for the 2023 Notes may be harmed. Accordingly, investors may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the 2023 Notes for an indefinite period of time.\nThe market price of the 2023 Notes may fluctuate.\nIf an active trading market for the 2023 Notes does develop on the TASE, the 2023 Notes may trade at prices lower than the offering price. The trading price of the 2023 Notes depends on many factors, including:\nprevailing interest rates;\nthe prevailing exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar to the NIS;\nthe market for similar securities;\ngeneral political, economic and financial market conditions in Israel and globally;\nour issuance of debt or preferred equity securities; and\nour financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, a downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or the 2023 Notes, if any, or change in the debt markets could cause the liquidity or market value of the 2023 Notes to decline significantly.\nOur credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2023 Notes. These credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the 2023 Notes. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion. Neither we nor any underwriter undertakes any obligation to maintain our credit ratings or to advise holders of 2023 Notes of any changes in our credit ratings. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain for any given period of time or that they will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely if in the judgment of the rating agency future circumstances relating to the basis of our credit ratings, such as adverse changes in our company, so warrant. In addition, the interest rate payable under the 2023 Notes will increase in the event of certain ratings declines or if a rating agency ceases to rate the 2023 Notes for more than 21 days until such declines are reversed and/or the 2023 Notes are again rated by a rating agency.\nThe deed of trust under which the 2023 Notes were issued contains limited protection for holders of the 2023 Notes.\nThe deed of trust under which the 2023 Notes were issued offers limited protection to holders of the 2023 Notes. The terms of the deed of trust and the 2023 Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on each holders investment in the 2023 Notes. In particular, subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants, the terms of the deed of trust and the 2023 Notes will not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to:\nissue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the 2023 Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the 2023 Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore would rank structurally senior to the 2023 Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or other obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior in right of payment to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore would rank structurally senior in right of payment to the 2023 Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1)-(2) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions;\npay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the 2023 Notes;\nsell assets;\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\nmake investments; or\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nOur ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the 2023 Notes may have important consequences for holders of the 2023 Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2023 Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the 2023 Notes.\nOther debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the deed of trust and the 2023 Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the 2023 Notes.\nThe optional redemption provision may materially adversely affect the return on the 2023 Notes.\nThe 2023 Notes are redeemable in whole or in part upon certain conditions at any time or from time to time at our option. We may choose to redeem the 2023 Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the 2023 Notes. In this circumstance, holders of the 2023 Notes may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the 2023 Notes being redeemed.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the 2023 Notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Credit Facility, or under other indebtedness to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the 2023 Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the 2023 Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the Credit Facility or other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the agreements relating to the Credit Facility, or other debt that we may incur in the future to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under the Credit Facility or other debt and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders. If this occurs, we would be in default and our lenders or debt holders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations, including the lenders under the Credit Facility, could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. Because the Credit Facility has, and any future debt will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness thereunder or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due.\nFATCA withholding may apply to payments to certain foreign entities.\nPayments made under the 2023 Notes to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity (including such an institution or entity acting as an intermediary) may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30% under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as FATCA) provisions of the Code. This U.S. withholding tax may apply to certain payments of interest on the 2023 Notes, unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Depending upon the status of a holder and the status of an intermediary through which any notes are held, the holder could be subject to this 30% U.S. withholding tax in respect of any interest paid on the notes. Proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their present form, would eliminate the application of this 30% U.S. withholding tax in respect of payments of certain gross proceeds. Pursuant to these proposed Treasury Regulations, we and any other applicable withholding agent may (but are not required to) rely on this proposed change to FACTA withholding until final regulations are issued or until such proposed Treasury Regulations are rescinded. Holders of the 2023 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA and how it may affect their investment in the 2023 Notes.\nIt may be difficult to obtain and enforce civil judgments against us and our directors, officers and experts.\nWe are a Maryland corporation and our principal executive offices are located in Miami, Florida. All of our assets are located outside of Israel. As a result, even though the deed of trust for the 2023 Notes is governed by Israeli law and any disputes thereunder are stipulated to be adjudicated in Israeli courts, holders of the 2023 Notes may have difficulty enforcing in Israel judgments they may obtain in an Israeli court against us.\nU.S. courts may refuse to hear a securities law claim of a non-U.S. investor who purchased our securities on the TASE. In addition, since our directors, officers and experts are located outside of Israel, it may be difficult serving legal process upon any of these persons. It also may be difficult enforcing judgments holders of the 2023 Notes may obtain in Israeli courts against us or those persons in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws.\nIt may also be difficult to assert U.S. securities laws claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In particular, the Israeli Securities Law expressly authorizes Israeli courts to stay a securities lawsuit against a dual-listed company while a lawsuit on similar grounds is being adjudicated in a non-Israeli court.\nSubject to specified time limitations and legal procedures, under the rules of private international law currently prevailing in Israel, Israeli courts may enforce a U.S. judgment in a civil matter, including a judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws, as well as a monetary or compensatory judgment in a non-civil matter, provided that the following key conditions are met:\nsubject to limited exceptions, the judgment is final and non-appealable;\nthe judgment was given by a court competent under the laws of the state of the court and is otherwise enforceable in such state;\nthe judgment was rendered by a court competent under the rules of private international law applicable in Israel;\nthe laws of the state in which the judgment was given provide for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts;\nadequate service of process has been effected and the defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to present his arguments and evidence;\nthe judgment and its enforcement are not contrary to the law, public policy, security or sovereignty of the State of Israel;\nthe judgment was not obtained by fraud and does not conflict with any other valid judgment in the same matter between the same parties; and\nan action between the same parties in the same matter was not pending in any Israeli court at the time the lawsuit was instituted in the U.S. court.\nRisks Relating to Our 2026 Notes\nThe 2026 Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future.\nThe 2026 Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2026 Notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had\n$168.8 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Funding I, and the indebtedness under the Credit Facility is therefore effectively senior in right of payment to the 2026 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets.\nThe 2026 Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe 2026 Notes are obligations exclusively of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is or acts as a guarantor of the 2026 Notes, and the 2026 Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Our secured indebtedness with respect to the Credit Facility is held through Funding I, and our secured indebtedness with respect to the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is held through the Securitization Issuer. The assets of any such subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2026 Notes.\nExcept to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries) will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2026 Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the 2026 Notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise.\nThe indenture under which the 2026 Notes were issued contains limited protection for their respective holders.\nThe indenture under which the 2026 Notes were issued offers limited protection for their respective holders. The terms of the indenture and the 2026 Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on each holders investment in the 2026 Notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the 2026 Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to:\nissue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the 2026 Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the 2026 Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness or other obligations of ours that are guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore would rank structurally senior to the 2026 Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or other obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior in right of payment to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore would rank structurally senior in right of payment to the 2026 Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) and (2) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, as such obligations may be amended or superseded, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC;\npay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the 2026 Notes;\nsell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets);\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\ncreate liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\nmake investments; or\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the indenture will not require us to offer to purchase the 2026 Notes in connection with a change of control or any other event.\nFurthermore, the terms of the indenture and the 2026 Notes do not protect their respective holders in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity, except as required under the 1940 Act.\nOur ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the 2026 Notes may have important consequences for their holders, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2026 Notes or negatively affecting their trading value.\nCertain of our current debt instruments include more protections for their respective holders than the indenture and the 2026 Notes. In addition, other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture governing the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the 2026 Notes.\nThe optional redemption provision may materially adversely affect your return on the 2026 Notes.\nThe 2026 Notes will be redeemable in whole or in part upon certain conditions at any time, or from time to time, at our option, on or after January 1, 2026. We may choose to redeem the 2026 Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the 2026 Notes. In this circumstance, investors may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the 2026 Notes being redeemed.\nWe may not be able to repurchase the 2026 Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, subject to certain conditions, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding 2026 Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for that purchase of 2026 Notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our operations or other potential sources, including borrowings, investment repayments, sales of assets or sales of equity. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds from such sources will be available at the time of any Change of Control Repurchase Event to make required repurchases of the 2026 Notes tendered. Before making any such repurchase of the 2026 Notes, we may have to comply with certain requirements under our then existing financing arrangements, such as the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes. Our future debt instruments may also contain similar restrictions and provisions. If the holders of the 2026 Notes exercise their right to require us to repurchase the 2026 Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the financial effect of this repurchase could cause a default under our existing or future debt instruments, even if the Change of Control Repurchase Event itself would not cause a default. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the Change of Control Repurchase Event to make the required repurchase of the 2026 Notes or our other debt.\nWhile a trading market has developed after issuing the 2026 Notes, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the 2026 Notes will be maintained.\nWhile a trading market developed after issuing the 2026 Notes, we cannot assure you that an active and liquid market for the 2026 Notes will be maintained. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the 2026 Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. If the 2026 Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount to their public offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, including the impact of COVID-19, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. The underwriters of the 2026 Notes may discontinue any market-making in the 2026 Notes at any time at their sole discretion. In addition, any market-making activity will be subject to limits imposed by law. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will be maintained for the 2026 Notes, that you will be able to sell the 2026 Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market is not maintained, the liquidity and trading price for the 2026 Notes may be harmed. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the 2026 Notes for an indefinite period of time.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the 2026 Notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt or under other indebtedness to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the 2026 Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the 2026 Notes.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders or holders under the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt or other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders or holders under the agreements relating to the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt or other debt that we may incur in the future to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt or other debt and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders. If this occurs, we would be in default and our lenders or holders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders or holders having secured obligations, including the lenders or holders under the Credit Facility and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, could proceed against the collateral securing such debt. Because the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt have, and any future debt will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness thereunder or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of a credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our unsecured debt, if any, or change in the debt markets could cause the liquidity or market value of the 2026 Notes to decline significantly.\nOur credit ratings are an assessment by a rating agency of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2026 Notes. These credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the 2026 Notes. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion. Neither we nor any underwriter undertakes any obligation to maintain our credit ratings or to advise holders of Notes of any changes in our credit ratings. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain for any given period of time or that such credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit ratings, such as adverse changes in our company, so warrant. An increase in the competitive environment, inability to cover distributions, or increase in leverage could lead to a downgrade in our credit ratings and limit our access to the debt and equity markets capability impairing our ability to grow the business. The conditions of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the 2026 Notes.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR DEBT SECURITIZATION\nWe are subject to certain risks as a result of our interests in connection with the Debt Securitization and our equity interest in the Securitization Issuers.\nOn September 19, 2019, in connection with the Debt Securitization and the offering of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt by the Securitization Issuers, we sold and/or contributed to the Depositor certain senior loans made to certain of our portfolio companies, or the Securitization Loans, which the Depositor in turn sold and/or contributed to the Securitization Issuer in exchange for 100% of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, 100% of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. Following these transfers, the Securitization Issuer, and not the Depositor or us, held all of the ownership interest in the Securitization Loans.\nAs a result of the Debt Securitization, we hold, indirectly through the Depositor, 100% of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. As a result, we consolidate the financial statements of the Depositor and the Securitization Issuers, as well as our other subsidiaries, in our consolidated financial statements. Because each of the Depositor and the Securitization Issuer is disregarded as an entity separate from its owners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the sale or contribution by us to the Depositor, and by the Depositor to the Securitization Issuer, as applicable, did not constitute a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to take a contrary position, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurther, a failure of the Securitization Issuer to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes would constitute an event of default pursuant to the applicable indenture under the Debt Securitization, upon which the trustee under the Debt Securitization, or the Securitization Trustee, may and will at the direction of a majority of the holders of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, or the Securitization Debtholders, declare the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt to be immediately due and payable and exercise remedies under the indenture, including (i) to institute proceedings for the collection of all amounts then payable on the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, or under the indenture, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the Securitization Issuers and any other obligor upon the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt monies adjudged due; (ii) institute proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of the indenture with respect to the property of the Securitization Issuers; (iii) exercise any remedies as a secured party under the relevant Uniform Commercial Code and take other appropriate action under applicable law to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Securitization Trustee and the Securitization Debtholders; or (iv) sell the property of the Securitization Issuers or any portion thereof or rights or interest therein at one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any matter permitted by law. Any such exercise of remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAn event of default in connection with the Debt Securitization could give rise to a cross-default under our other material indebtedness.\nThe documents governing our other material indebtedness contain customary cross-default provisions that could be triggered if an event of default occurs in connection with the Debt Securitization. An event of default with respect to our other indebtedness could lead to the acceleration of such indebtedness and the exercise of other remedies as provided in the documents governing such other indebtedness. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and may result in our inability to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.\nWe may not receive cash distributions in respect of our indirect ownership interests in the Securitization Issuers.\nApart from fees payable to us in connection with our role as servicer of the Securitization Loans and the reimbursement of related amounts under the documents governing the Debt Securitization, we receive cash in connection with the Debt Securitization only to the extent that the Depositor receives payments in respect of its equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. The respective holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers are the residual claimants on distributions, if any, made by the Securitization Issuers after the Securitization Debtholders and other claimants have been paid in full on each payment date or upon maturity of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, subject to the priority of payments under the documents governing the Debt Securitization. To the extent that the value of the Securitization Issuers portfolio of loans is reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets (relevant in the event of a liquidation event), other macroeconomic factors, distressed or defaulted loans or the failure of individual portfolio companies to otherwise meet their obligations in respect of the loans, or for any other reason, the ability of the Securitization Issuers to make cash distributions in respect of the Depositors equity interests would be negatively affected and consequently, the value of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers would also be reduced. In the event that we fail to receive cash indirectly from the Securitization Issuers, we could be unable to make distributions, if at all, in amounts sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.\nThe interests of the Securitization Debtholders may not be aligned with our interests.\nThe 2031 Asset-Backed Debt constitutes debt obligations ranking senior in right of payment to the rights of the holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers, as residual claimants in respect of distributions, if any, made by the Securitization Issuers. As such, there are circumstances in which the interests of the Securitization Debtholders may not be aligned with the interests of holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. For example, under the terms of the documents governing the Debt Securitization, the Securitization Debtholders have the right to receive payments of principal and interest prior to holders of the equity interests.\nFor as long as the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt remains outstanding, the respective Securitization Debtholders have the right to act in certain circumstances with respect to the Securitization Loans in ways that may benefit their interests but not the interests of the respective holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers, including by exercising remedies under the documents governing the Debt Securitization.\nIf an event of default occurs, the Securitization Debtholders will be entitled to determine the remedies to be exercised, subject to the terms of the documents governing the Debt Securitization. For example, upon the occurrence of an event of default with respect to the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, the Securitization Trustee may and will at the direction of the holders of a majority of the applicable 2031 Asset-Backed Debt declare the principal, together with any accrued interest, of the debt to be immediately due and payable. This would have the effect of accelerating the principal on such debt, triggering a repayment obligation on the part of the Securitization Issuers. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt then outstanding will be paid in full before any further payment or distribution on the equity interest is made. There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient funds through collections on the Securitization Loans or through the proceeds of the sale of the Securitization Loans in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency to repay in full the obligations under the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt, or to make any distribution to holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers.\nRemedies pursued by the Securitization Debtholders could be adverse to our interests as the indirect holder of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. The Securitization Debtholders have no obligation to consider any possible adverse effect on such other interests. Thus, there can be no assurance that any remedies pursued by the Securitization Debtholders will be consistent with the best interests of the Depositor or that we will receive, indirectly through the Depositor, any payments or distributions upon an acceleration of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. Any failure of the Securitization Issuers to make distributions in respect of the equity interests that we indirectly hold, whether as a result of an event of default and the acceleration of payments on the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and may result in our inability to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.\nWe have certain repurchase obligations with respect to the Securitization Loans transferred in connection with the Debt Securitization.\nAs part of each Debt Securitization, we entered into a master loan agreement under which we would be required to repurchase any Securitization Loan (or participation interest therein) which was sold to the Securitization Issuer in breach of certain customary representations and warranties made by us or by the Depositor with respect to such Securitization Loan or the legal structure of the applicable Debt Securitization. To the extent that there is a breach of such representations and warranties and we fail to satisfy any such repurchase obligation, the Securitization Trustee may, on behalf of the Securitization Issuer, bring an action against us to enforce these repurchase obligations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nThe ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia and related sanctions have increased global political and economic uncertainty, which may have a material impact on the Company's portfolio and the value of any investment in the Company.\nThe ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia and related sanctions have increased global political and economic uncertainty. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and, in response, the United States and many other countries placed economic sanctions on certain Russian entities and individuals. Because Russia is a major exporter of oil and natural gas, the invasion and related sanctions have reduced the supply, and increased the price, of energy, which is accelerating inflation and may exacerbate ongoing supply chain issues. There is also the risk of retaliatory actions by Russia against countries which have enacted sanctions, including cyberattacks against financial and governmental institutions, which could result in business disruptions and further economic turbulence. Although the Company has no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine, the broader consequences of the invasion may have a material adverse impact on the Company's portfolio and the value of any investment in the Company. Because this is an uncertain and evolving situation, its full impact is unknown at this time.\nInflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nCertain of our portfolio companies are in industries that may be impacted by inflation. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs of operations along to their customers, it could adversely affect their operating results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans, particularly if interest rates rise in response to inflation. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future realized or unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations.\nGlobal capital markets could enter a period of severe disruption and instability due to future recessions, disease pandemics and other serious health events, political instability, geopolitical turmoil and foreign hostilities. These market conditions have historically had and could again have a materially adverse effect on debt and equity capital markets in the United States, which could have a materially negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. and global capital markets have, from time to time, experienced periods of disruption characterized by the freezing of available credit, a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant losses in the principal value of investments, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market, the failure of major financial institutions and general volatility in the financial markets. During these periods of disruption, general economic conditions deteriorated with material and adverse\nconsequences for the broader financial and credit markets, and the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole, and financial services firms in particular, was reduced significantly. These conditions may reoccur for a prolonged period of time or materially worsen in the future. In addition, uncertainty between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, treaties and tariffs, among other factors, have caused disruptions in the global markets, including markets in which we participate, and we cannot assure you that these market conditions will not continue or worsen in the future. We may in the future have difficulty accessing debt and equity capital markets, and a severe disruption in the global financial markets, deterioration in credit and financing conditions or uncertainty regarding U.S. government spending and deficit levels or other global economic and political conditions, including future recessions, political instability, geopolitical turmoil and foreign hostilities, and disease, pandemics and other serious health events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited Kingdoms Withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU with effect from January 31, 2020 (such departure from the EU, Brexit). On December 24, 2020, a trade agreement was concluded between the EU and the U. K. (the TCA), which formally took effect on May 1, 2021, and now governs the relationship between the U.K. and EU.\nAlthough the TCA covers many issues, it is silent on items such as financial services equivalence. As such, there remains uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU and the effect and implications of the TCA.\nThe actual and potential consequences of Brexit, and the associated uncertainty, have adversely affected, and for the foreseeable future may adversely affect, economic and market conditions in the U.K., in the EU and its member states and elsewhere, and may also contribute to uncertainty and instability in global financial markets, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and results of operations and those of our portfolio companies. There may be detrimental implications for the value of the Companys investments. This may be due to, among other things: (i) increased uncertainty and volatility in U.K., EU and other financial markets; (ii) fluctuations in asset values; (iii) fluctuations in exchange rates; (iv) increased illiquidity of investments located, listed or traded within the U.K., the EU or elsewhere; (v) changes in the willingness or ability of financial and other counterparties to enter into transactions, or the price at which and terms on which they are prepared to transact; and/or (vi) changes in legal and regulatory regimes to which the Company or certain of the Companys assets and/or service providers are or become subject.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty.\nThe U.S. capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of COVID-19. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a prolonged period of world-wide economic downturn. Disruptions in the capital markets have in the past increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets. Such disruptions adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and future market disruptions and/or illiquidity may again negatively impact us. Such unfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding costs and limit our access to the capital markets, and may result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us in the future. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments. As such, we could also face an increased risk of investor, creditor or portfolio company disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions.\nVolatility or a prolonged disruption in the credit markets could materially damage our business.\nWe are required to record our assets at fair value, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, in accordance with our valuation policy. As a result, volatility in the capital markets may have a material adverse effect on our valuations and our NAV, even if we hold investments to maturity. Volatility or dislocation in the capital markets may depress our stock price below our NAV per share and create a challenging environment in which to raise equity and debt capital. As a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than our NAV without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. Additionally, our ability to incur indebtedness is limited by the asset coverage ratio requirements for a BDC, as defined under the 1940 Act. Declining portfolio values negatively impact our ability to borrow additional funds under the Credit Facility because our NAV is reduced for purposes of the asset coverage ratio. If the fair value of our assets declines substantially, we may fail to maintain the asset coverage ratio stipulated by the 1940 Act, which could, in turn, cause us to lose our status as a BDC and materially impair our business operations. A lengthy disruption in the credit markets could also materially decrease demand for our investments and could materially damage our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe significant disruptions in the capital markets experienced in the past has had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. The debt capital that may be available to us in the future may be at a higher cost and have less favorable terms and conditions than those currently in effect. If our financing costs increase and we have no increase in interest income, then our net investment income will decrease. A prolonged inability to raise capital may require us to reduce the volume of investments we originate and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This may also increase the probability that other structural risks negatively impact us. These situations may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a lengthy disruption in the credit markets, a severe decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, a sharp economic downturn or recession or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, and could materially damage our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic or any outbreak of other existing or new diseases, and the resulting financial and economic market uncertainty could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe extent of the impact of any public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our and our portfolio companies operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of such public health emergency, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain its financial and economic impact, the extent of any related travel advisories and restrictions implemented, the impact of such public health emergency on overall supply and demand, investor liquidity and levels of economic activity and the extent of its disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, our and our portfolio companies operations may be significantly impacted, or halted, as a result of government quarantine measures, restrictions on travel and other factors related to a public health emergency, including its potential adverse impact on the health of any of our or our portfolio companies personnel. This could create widespread business continuity issues for us and our portfolio companies. These factors may also cause the valuation of our investments to differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Any public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic or any outbreak of other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, and the resulting financial and economic market uncertainty could have a significant adverse impact on us and the fair value of our investments and our portfolio companies.\nEconomic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies.\nEconomic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us or our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies. In the United States, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control administers and enforces laws, executive orders and regulations establishing U.S. economic and trade sanctions, which prohibit, among other things, transactions with, and the provision of services to, certain non-U.S. countries, territories, entities and individuals. These types of sanctions may significantly restrict or completely prohibit investment activities in certain jurisdictions, and if we, our portfolio companies or other issuers in which we invest were to violate any such laws or regulations, we may face significant legal and monetary penalties.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, as well as anti-boycott regulations, may also apply to and restrict our activities, our portfolio companies and other issuers of our investments. If an issuer or we were to violate any such laws or regulations, such issuer or we may face significant legal and monetary penalties. The U.S. government has indicated that it is particularly focused on FCPA enforcement, which may increase the risk that an issuer or us becomes the subject of such actual or threatened enforcement. In addition, certain commentators have suggested that private investment firms and the funds that they manage may face increased scrutiny and/or liability with respect to the activities of their underlying portfolio companies. As such, a violation of the FCPA or other applicable regulations by us or an issuer of our portfolio investments could have a material adverse effect on us. We are committed to complying with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, as well as anti-boycott regulations, to which it is subject. As a result, we may be adversely affected because of our unwillingness to enter into transactions that violate any such laws or regulations.\nWe may be the target of litigation.\nWe may be the target of securities litigation in the future, particularly if the trading price of our common stock or our 2026 Notes fluctuates significantly. We could also generally be subject to litigation, including derivative actions by our stockholders. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources from our business and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our portfolio companies.\nThere may be evidence of global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk and some of our portfolio companies may be adversely affected by climate change. For example, the needs of customers of energy companies vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increases in the cost of energy could adversely affect the cost of operations of our portfolio companies if the use of energy products or services is material to their business. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect some of our portfolio companies financial condition through, for example, decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions.\nLegislative or regulatory tax changes could adversely affect investors.\nAt any time, the federal income tax laws governing RICs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. The Biden Administration has enacted significant changes to the existing U.S. tax rules that include, among others, a minimum tax on book income and profits of certain multinational corporations, and there are a number of proposals in the U.S. Congress that would similarly modify the existing U.S. tax rules. The likelihood of any new legislation being enacted is uncertain. Any new laws, regulations or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect the taxation of us or our shareholders. Therefore, changes in tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations or any amendments thereto could diminish the value of an investment in our shares or the value or the resale potential of our investments. Item 1B.\tUnresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2.\tProperties\nAs of September 30, 2022, we did not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operation. We believe that the office facilities of the Investment Adviser and Administrator are suitable and adequate for our business as it is contemplated to be conducted. Item 3.\tLegal Proceedings\nNone of us, our Investment Adviser or our Administrator, is currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us, or against our Investment Adviser or Administrator. From time to time, we, our Investment Adviser or Administrator may be a party to certain legal proceedings, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange and the TASE under the symbol PFLT. The following table lists the high and low closing sale prices for our common stock, the closing sale prices as a premium or (discount) to our NAV per share and distributions per share for each full quarterly period within the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nPremium /\nPremium /\n(Discount)\n(Discount)\nClosing Sale Prices\nof High Sale\nof Low Sale\nDistributions\nPeriod\nNAV (1)\nHigh\nLow\nPrice to NAV (2)\nPrice to NAV (2)\nDeclared\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nFourth quarter\n$\n11.62\n$\n13.19\n$\n9.60\n%\n(17\n)%\n$\n0.285\nThird quarter\n12.21\n14.20\n10.45\n(14\n)\n0.285\nSecond quarter\n12.62\n13.56\n12.23\n(3\n)\n0.285\nFirst quarter\n12.70\n13.80\n12.23\n(4\n)\n0.285\nYear Ended September 30, 2021\nFourth quarter\n$\n12.62\n$\n13.41\n$\n12.51\n%\n(1\n)%\n$\n0.285\nThird quarter\n12.81\n13.19\n11.94\n(7\n)\n0.285\nSecond quarter\n12.71\n12.63\n10.46\n(1\n)\n(18\n)\n0.285\nFirst quarter\n12.70\n10.96\n7.80\n(14\n)\n(39\n)\n0.285\n(1)NAV per share is determined as of the last day in the relevant quarter and therefore may not reflect the NAV per share on the date of the high and low sales prices. The NAVs shown are based on outstanding shares at the end of each period.\n(2)Calculated as the respective high or low closing sales price less NAV per share, divided by the quarter-end NAV per share.\nShares of BDCs may trade at a market price both above and below the NAV that is attributable to those shares. Our shares have traded above and below our NAV. Our shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $9.60 and the Nasdaq Global Select Market at $12.79 on September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our NAV per share was $11.62 and $12.62 as of the same dates. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV will decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our shares will trade at, above or below our NAV in the future. As of September 30, 2022, we had 37 stockholders of record.\nSale of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not engage in any sales of unregistered securities during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe did not repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase plan during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nWe intend to continue making monthly distributions to our stockholders. The timing and amount of our monthly distributions, if any, is determined by our board of directors. Any distributions to our stockholders are declared out of assets legally available for distribution. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a tax return of capital to our common stockholders.\nIn January 2023, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to stockholders subject to information reporting that will state the amount and composition of distributions and provide information with respect to appropriate tax treatment of our distributions.\nThe tax characteristics of distributions declared, in accordance with Section 19(a) of the 1940 Act, for our fiscal and taxable years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 from ordinary income (including short-term gains), if any, totaled $46.7 million , or $1.14 per share , and $44.2 million, or $1.14 per share, based on the weighted average shares outstanding for the respective periods. Additionally, for both years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we did not pay any distributions from long-term capital gains.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings when applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain minimum percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis graph compares the return on our common stock with that of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index (the \"S&P Index\") and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index, for the last five fiscal years. The graph assumes that, on September 30, 2017, a person invested $100 in each of our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index. The graph measures total stockholder return, which takes into account both changes in stock price and distributions. It assumes that distributions paid are invested in like securities.\nThe graph and other information furnished under this Part II Item 5 of this Report shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act. The stock price performance included in the above graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.\nFEES AND EXPENSES\nThe following table is being provided to update, as of September 30, 2022, certain information in our registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-235532), most recently declared effective by the SEC on January 29, 2020. This table will assist you in understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor in shares of our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. However, we caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary from actual results. The following table should not be considered a representation of our future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than shown. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever reference is made to fees or expenses paid by you or us or that we will pay, stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in us.\nStockholder transaction expenses\nSales load (as a percentage of offering price)\n-\n%\n(1)\nOffering expenses (as a percentage of offering price)\n-\n(2)\nTotal stockholder expenses (as a percentage of offering price)\n-\nEstimated annual expenses (as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common shares)(3)\nManagement fees\n2.35\n%\n(4)\nIncentive fees\n2.29\n%\n(5)\nInterest on borrowed funds\n5.85\n%\n(6)\nAcquired fund fees and expenses\n7.35\n%\n(7)\nOther expenses\n0.71\n%\n(8)\nTotal estimated annual expenses\n18.55\n%\n(9)\n(1)In the event that the securities to which any applicable prospectus relates are sold to or through underwriters or agents, a corresponding prospectus supplement will disclose the applicable sales load.\n(2)In the event that we conduct an offering of our securities, a corresponding prospectus supplement will disclose the estimated amount of offering expenses, the offering price and the offering expenses borne by us as a percentage of the offering price.\n(3)Net assets attributable to common shares equals average net assets for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\n(4)The contractual management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of our average adjusted gross assets on September 30, 2022. The contractual management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of our average adjusted gross assets on September 30, 2022.\n(5)The portion of incentive fees paid with respect to net investment income and capital gains, if any, is based on actual amounts incurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Such incentive fees are based on performance, vary from period to period and are not paid unless our performance exceeds specified thresholds. Incentive fees in respect of net investment income do not include incentive fees in respect of net capital gains. The portion of our incentive fee paid in respect of net capital gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20.0% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For purposes of this chart and our Consolidated Financial Statements, our incentive fees on capital gains are calculated in accordance with GAAP. As we cannot predict our future net investment income or capital gains, the incentive fee paid in future periods, if any, may be substantially different than the fee earned during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. For more detailed information about the incentive fee, please see Item 1. Business-Investment Management Agreement and Item 1. Business-Investment Advisory Fees.\n(6)As of September 30, 2022, we had $168.8 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, $97.0 million outstanding under our 2023 Notes, $185.0 million outstanding under of 2026 Notes and $228.0 million outstanding under the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. We may use proceeds of an offering of securities under any applicable registration statement to repay outstanding obligations under the Credit Facility. After completing any such offering, we may continue to borrow under the Credit Facility to finance our investment objectives. Annual interest expense on borrowed funds represents actual interest expense, amendment costs incurred on the Credit Facility, and debt issuance costs, if any, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and we caution you that our actual interest expense in the future will depend on prevailing interest rates and our rate of borrowing, which may be substantially higher than the amount provided in this table.\n(7)Our stockholders indirectly bear 87.5% of the expenses of our investment in PSSL. No management fee is charged by PennantPark Investment Advisers in connection with PSSL. PSSL pays the Administrator an annual fee of 0.25% of average gross assets under management. For this chart, PSSL fees and operating expenses are based on our share of the actual fees and operating expenses of PSSL for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Expenses for PSSL may fluctuate over time and may be substantially higher or lower in the future.\nOur stockholders indirectly bear 23.08% of the expenses of our investment in PTSF. A management fee equal to 0.30% per annum of the gross assets of PTSF and its subsidiaries is charged by PennantPark Investment Advisers in connection with PTSF (which is waived by PennantPark Investment Advisers). When applicable, fees and operating expenses estimates would be based on historic fees and operating expenses for acquired funds. For PTSF, which has a limited operating history, fees and operating expenses are estimates based on expected fees and operating expenses of PTSF for the applicable fiscal quarter, annualized for a full year. Expenses for PTSF may fluctuate over time and may be substantially higher or lower in the future.\n(8)Other expenses includes our general and administrative expenses, professional fees, directors fees, insurance costs, taxes and the expenses of the Investment Adviser reimbursable under our Investment Management Agreement and of the Administrator reimbursable under our Administration Agreement. Such expenses are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year.\n(9)Total estimated annual expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common shares, to the extent we borrow money to make investments, are higher than the total estimated annual expenses percentage would be for a company that is not leveraged. We may borrow money to leverage our net assets and increase our total assets. The SEC requires that the total estimated annual expenses percentage be calculated as a percentage of average net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness) rather than total assets, which include assets that have been funded with borrowed money. If the Total estimated annual expenses percentage were calculated instead as a percentage of total assets, our Total estimated annual expenses would be 7.47% of average total assets.\nExample\nThe following example illustrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that you would pay on a $1,000 hypothetical investment in common shares, assuming (1) a 3.0% sales load (underwriting discounts and commissions) and offering expenses totaling 0.50%, (2) total net estimated annual expenses of 16.26% of average net assets attributable to common shares as set forth in the table above (other than performance-based incentive fees) and (3) a 5% annual return.\nYou would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 common stock investment\n1 Years\n3 Years\n5 Years\n10 Years\nAssuming a 5% annual return (assumes no return from net realized capital gains or net\nunrealized capital appreciation)\n$\n$\n$\n$\nAssuming a 5% annual return (assumes return only from realized capital gains and thus\nsubject to the capital gains incentive fee)\n$\n$\n$\n$\nThis example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those assumed. The table above is provided to assist you in understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor in our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. If we were to earn an annual return equal to or less than 5% from net investment income, the incentive fee under our Investment Management Agreement would not be earned or payable. If our returns on our investments, including the realized capital gains, result in an incentive fee, then our expenses would be higher. The example assumes that all distributions are reinvested at NAV. See Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Distributions for more information. Item 6.\tSelected Financial Data\nNone Item 7.\tMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Report, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to us and our consolidated subsidiaries regarding future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our Company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\nour future operating results;\nour business prospects and the prospects of our prospective portfolio companies, including as a result of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 or any future worsening there of;\nchanges in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets that could result in changes to the value of our assets, including changes from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future worsening there of;\nthe dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;\nthe impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business;\nthe impact of investments that we expect to make;\nthe impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our business and our portfolio companies;\nour contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;\nthe valuation of our investments in portfolio companies, particularly those having no liquid trading market;\nthe ability of our prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;\nour expected financings and investments and ability to fund capital commitments to PSSL;\nthe adequacy of our cash resources and working capital;\nthe timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies;\nthe impact of price and volume fluctuations in the stock market;\nincreasing levels of inflation, and its impact on us and our portfolio companies;\nthe ability of our Investment Adviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments;\nthe impact of future legislation and regulation on our business and our portfolio companies; and\nthe impact of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia, United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as Brexit) and other world economic and political issues.\nWe use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, seeks, plans, estimates and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue influence on the forward-looking statements as our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Report.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new loans and investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Report on information available to us on the date of this Report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in this Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including reports on Form 10-Q/K and current reports on Form 8-K.\nYou should understand that under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to forward-looking statements made in periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report.\nOverview\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. is a BDC whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital by investing primarily in floating rate loans and other investments made to U.S. middle-market companies.\nWe believe that floating rate loans to U.S. middle-market companies offer attractive risk-reward to investors due to a limited amount of capital available for such companies. We use the term middle-market to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. Our investments are typically rated below investment grade. Securities rated below investment grade are often referred to as leveraged loans or high yield securities or junk bonds and are often higher risk compared to debt instruments that are rated above investment grade and have speculative characteristics. However, when compared to junk bonds and other non-investment\ngrade debt, senior secured floating rate loans typically have more robust capital-preserving qualities, such as historically lower default rates than junk bonds, represent the senior source of capital in a borrowers capital structure and often have certain of the borrowers assets pledged as collateral. Our debt investments may generally range in maturity from three to ten years and are made to U.S. and, to a limited extent, non-U.S. corporations, partnerships and other business entities which operate in various industries and geographical regions.\nUnder normal market conditions, we generally expect that at least 80% of the value of our managed assets will be invested in floating rate loans and other investments bearing a variable-rate of interest. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least 65% of our overall portfolio. We also generally expect to invest up to 35% of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt and subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. We seek to create a diversified portfolio by generally targeting an investment size between $5 million and $30 million, on average, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nOur investment activity depends on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nOrganization and Structure of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd., a Maryland corporation organized in October 2010, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\nOur investment activities are managed by the Investment Adviser. Under our Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Investment Adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, provides overall supervision of our activities, and the Investment Adviser supervises our day-to-day activities.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nOn August 20, 2021, the Company entered into equity distribution agreements (together, as amended from time to time, the \"Equity Distribution Agreements\") with each of JMP Securities LLC and Raymond James & Associates, Inc., as the sales agents (each, a \"Sales Agent,\" and together, the \"Sales Agents\"), in connection with the sale of shares of our Common Stock with an aggregate offering price of up to $75 million under an at-the-market offering. On May 5, 2022, we amended the Equity Distribution Agreements to update references from NASDAQ to NYSE and reflect that the agents are now represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP. The Equity Distribution Agreements, as amended, provide that we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock from time to time through a Sales Agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities we hold and capital gains and dividends, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt or subordinated debt, typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a floating or fixed rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, commitment, origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID and market discount or premium are capitalized and accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. Litigation settlements are accounted for in accordance with the gain contingency provisions of ASC Subtopic 450-30, Gain Contingencies, or ASC 450-30.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of a management fee and the payment of an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser, if any, our allocable portion of overhead under our Administration Agreement and other operating costs as detailed below. Our management fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, consummating and monitoring our investments. Additionally, we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt and unused commitment fees on undrawn amounts, under our various debt facilities. We bear all other direct or indirect costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nthe cost of calculating our NAV, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\nthe cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\nfees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments or complementary businesses;\nexpenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments;\ntransfer agent and custodial fees;\nfees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\nfederal and state registration fees and any exchange listing fees;\nfederal, state, local and foreign taxes;\nindependent directors fees and expenses;\nbrokerage commissions;\nfidelity bond, directors and officers, errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\ndirect costs such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;\nfees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;\ncosts associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and\nall other expenses incurred by either the Administrator or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under our Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead, and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs.\nGenerally, during periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be additive to the expenses described above.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of September 30, 2022, our portfolio totaled $1,164.3 million and consisted of $1,009.6 million of first lien secured debt (including $190.2 million in PSSL), $0.1million of second lien secured debt and $154.5 million of preferred and common equity (including $49.4 million in PSSL). Our debt portfolio consisted of 100% variable-rate investments. As of September 30, 2022, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 0.9% and zero percent of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $8.7 million. Our overall portfolio consisted of 125 companies with an average investment size of $9.3 million, had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.0%, and was invested 87% in first lien secured debt (including 16% in PSSL), less than 1% in second lien secured debt and 13% in preferred and common equity (including 4% in PSSL). As of September 30, 2022, 99% of the investments held by PSSL were first lien secured debt.\nAs of September 30, 2021, our portfolio totaled $1,081.6 million and consisted of $934.4 million of first lien secured debt (including $140.9 million in PSSL), $8.9 million of second lien secured debt and $138.3 million of preferred and common equity (including $44.9 million in PSSL). Our debt portfolio consisted of 99% variable-rate investments. As of September 30, 2021, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 2.7% and 2.6% of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $11.0 million. Our overall portfolio consisted of 110 companies with an average investment size of $9.8 million, had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.4%, and was invested 86% in first lien secured debt (including 13% in PSSL), 1% in second lien secured debt and 13% in preferred and common equity (including 4% in PSSL). As of September 30, 2021, 99% of the investments held by PSSL were first lien secured debt.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we invested $607.8 million in 34 new and 129 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.8%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $495.2 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we invested $661.1 million in 35 new and 68 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.4%. Sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $702.1 million.\nPennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC\nAs of September 30, 2022, PSSLs portfolio totaled $754.7 million, consisted of 95 companies with an average investment size of $8.0 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 9.6%. As of September 30, 2021, PSSLs portfolio totaled $564.8 million, consisted of 74 companies with an average investment size of $7.6 million and had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.1%.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, PSSL invested $278.8 million (of which $270.6 million was purchased from the Company) in 34 new and 20 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.1 %. PSSLs sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $102.4 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, PSSL invested $354.4 million (of which $285.7 million was purchased from the Company) in 42 new and 29 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.2%. PSSLs sales and repayments of investments for the same period totaled $185.7 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Actual results could differ from these estimates due to changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates and assumptions. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. References to ASC serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment Valuations\nWe expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of our investments which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material.\nOur portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n(1)Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;\n(2)Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of our Investment Adviser;\n(3)Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review managements preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker;\n(4)The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of our Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and\n(5)Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.\nOur board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available.\nFair value, as defined under ASC 820, is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies:\nLevel 1: Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3: Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.\nA financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt and the Credit Facility are classified as Level 3. Our 2026 Notes are classified as Level 2 as they are financial instruments with readily observable market inputs. Our 2023 Notes are classified as Level 1, as they were valued using the closing price from the primary exchange. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material.\nOn December 3, 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which establishes an updated regulatory framework for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. The new rule clarifies how fund boards of directors can satisfy their valuation obligations and requires, among other things, the board of directors to periodically assess material valuation risks and take steps to manage those risks. The rule also permit boards of directors, subject to board oversight and certain other conditions, to designate the funds investment adviser to perform fair value determinations. The new rule went into effect on March 8, 2021 and had a compliance date of September 8, 2022. We came into compliance with Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act before the compliance date. While our board of directors has not elected to designate the Investment Adviser as the valuation designee at this time, we have adopted certain revisions to our valuation policies and procedures in order comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act.\nIn addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2023 Notes, our 2026 Notes, our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt and the Credit Facility, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value.\nGenerally, the carrying value of our consolidated financial liabilities approximates fair value. We have adopted the principles ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of zero and $2.9 million relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facility and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a companys choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elected not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including the 2026 Notes and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt.\nFor the years September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of $(4.9) million and $(11.6) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the net unrealized depreciation on the Credit Facility or Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, the 2023 Notes totaled $2.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to\nmeasure the fair value of the Credit Facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that our board of directors uses to value our investments. Our 2023 Notes trade on the TASE and we use the closing price on the exchange to determine the fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest expense. We record prepayment penalties on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments, the Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOur books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:\n1.Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and\n2.Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses - at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.\nAlthough net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair value of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities.\nPayment-in-kind, or PIK, Interest\nWe have investments in our portfolio which contain a PIK interest provision. PIK interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income. In order for us to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even though we may not have collected any cash with respect to interest on PIK securities.\nFederal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be treated, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC tax election, we must, among other requirements, meet certain annual source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements. We also must annually distribute dividends for federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (subject to certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (i.e., the excess, if any, of our capital gains over capital losses), adjusted for certain ordinary losses, generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year plus (3) any net ordinary income or capital gain net income for the preceding years that was not distributed during such years on which we did not incur any corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be taxed as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a provision for taxes on net investment income of $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, pertaining to federal excise tax.\nThe Taxable Subsidiary (PFLT Investment Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The income tax expense and related tax liabilities of the Taxable Subsidiary are reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a provision for taxes of $4.6 million, zero and zero, respectively, on unrealized appreciation on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. The provision for taxes on unrealized appreciation on investments is the result of netting (i) the expected tax liability on gains from sales of investments and (ii) the expected tax benefit from the use of losses in the current year. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, $4.6 million and zero, respectively, was accrued as a deferred tax liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities relating to unrealized gain on investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company paid $1.2 million and zero, respectively, in taxes on realized gains on the sale of investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary which were offset by subsequently realized losses, resulting in a $1.2 million prepaid tax asset as of September 30, 2022 included under prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gain recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nWe have formed and expect to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiary, which are taxed as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSet forth below are the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. For information regarding results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2020, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as filed with the SEC on November 17, 2021.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $105.5 million and was attributable to $89.1 million from first lien secured debt and $16.4 million from other investments. The increase in investment income compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the size of our portfolio as well as the increase in LIBOR and SOFR indices.\nInvestment income for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $82.7 million and was attributable to $72.1 million from first lien secured debt and $10.6 million from other investments.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 totaled $56.9 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $11.9 million, incentive fee totaled $11.6 million, debt related interest and expenses totaled $29.8 million (including $0.4 million attributable to fees associated with the upsizing of the credit facility), general and administrative expenses totaled $3.2 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.4 million. The increase in expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in management fees under our Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Advisor and debt related interest and expenses.\nExpenses for the year ended September 30, 2021 totaled $43.1 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $10.7 million, incentive fee totaled $5.3 million, debt related interest and expenses totaled $24.5 million (including $2.9 million attributable to fees associated with entering into the New Credit Facility amendment fees) general and administrative expenses totaled $2.1 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.4 million.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income totaled $48.6 million, or $1.18 per share, and $39.6 million, or $1.02 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net investment income compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the size of our portfolio as well as the increase in LIBOR and SOFR indices.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nSales and repayments of investments for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 totaled $495.2 million and $702.1 million, respectively. Net realized losses totaled $(11.1) million and $12.8 million for the same periods, respectively. The change in realized gains (losses) was primarily due to changes in market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments, the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of $(24.5) million and $41.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments totaled $(13.1) million and $11.0 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on our investments for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized, caused by the fluctuations in the market and in the economy, as discussed above under the Forward-Looking Statements\" section above.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Credit Facility or Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, and the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of $(4.9) million and $(11.6) million and, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our net unrealized depreciation on the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, and the 2023 Notes totaled $2.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets, with the economic instability negatively affecting the value, as further discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements.\nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $3.5 million, or $0.08 per share, and $56.5 million, or $1.46 per share, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net assets from operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year was primarily due to depreciation of the portfolio primarily driven by changes in market conditions, as discussed above under Forward-Looking Statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives. As of September 30, 2022, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150% asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing. For information regarding liquidity and capital resources for the year ended September 30, 2020, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, as filed with the SEC on November 18, 2021.\nOn April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the SBCAA). As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), effective as of April 5, 2019, subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 178%% and 175%, respectively.\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment on the Credit Facility or Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, amendment costs and debt issuance costs, was 4.5% and 3.9%, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had\n$197.2 million and $80.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nFunding Is multi-currency Credit Facility with the Lenders was $366 million as of September 30, 2022, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC, has an interest rate spread above SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) of 225 basis points, a maturity date of August 2026 and a revolving period that ends in August 2024. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Funding I had $168.8 million and $219.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, respectively. The Credit Facility or the Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, had a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% and 2.3%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring the revolving period, the Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 225 basis points and, after the revolving period, the rate will reset to Base Rate (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 250 basis points for the remaining two years, maturing in August 2026. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding I. Both PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and Funding I have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities.\nThe Credit Facility contains covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions of loan size, currency types and amounts, industry requirements, average life of loans, geographic and individual portfolio concentrations, minimum portfolio yield and loan payment frequency. Additionally, the Credit Facility requires the maintenance of a minimum equity investment in Funding I and income ratio as well as restrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt. The Credit Facility compliance reporting is prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants relating to the Credit Facility.\nWe own 100% of the equity interest in Funding I and treat the indebtedness of Funding I as our leverage. Our Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager to Funding I under the Credit Facility.\nOur interest in Funding I (other than the management fee) is subordinate in priority of payment to every other obligation of Funding I and is subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility. We may receive cash distributions on our equity interests in Funding I only after it has made (1) all required cash interest and, if applicable, principal payments to the Lenders, (2) required administrative expenses and (3) claims of other unsecured creditors of Funding I. We cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds available to make any distributions to us or that such distributions will meet our expectations from Funding I. The Investment Adviser has irrevocably directed that the management fee owed with respect to such services is to be paid to the Company so long as the Investment Adviser remains the collateral manager.\nIn November 2017, we issued $138.6 million of our 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes were issued pursuant to a deed of trust between the Company and Mishmeret Trust Company, Ltd. as trustee, of which $97.0 million and $117.8 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe 2023 Notes pay interest at a rate of 4.3% per year. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2018. The principal on the 2023 Notes will be payable in four annual installments as follows: 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and 55% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2023.\nThe 2023 Notes are general, unsecured obligations, rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are generally redeemable at our option. The deed of trust governing the 2023 Notes includes certain customary covenants, including minimum equity requirements, and events of default. Please refer to the deed of trust filed as Exhibit (d)(8) to our post-effective amendment filed on December 13, 2017 for more information. The 2023 Notes are rated ilA- by S&P Global Ratings Maalot Ltd. and are listed on the TASE. In connection with this offering, we have dual listed our common stock on the TASE.\nThe 2023 Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, such registration requirements.\nIn March 2021 and in October 2021, we issued $100.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4% and 101.5%, respectively. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.25% per year, commencing October 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on April 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nIn September 2019, the Securitization Issuers completed the Debt Securitization. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by the middle market loans, participation interests in middle market loans and other assets of the Securitization Issuer. The Debt Securitization was executed through (A) a private placement of: (i) $78.5 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes maturing 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.8%, (ii) $15.0 million Class A-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at 3.7%, (iii) $14.0 million Class B-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.9%, (iv) $16.0 million Class B-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at 4.3%, (v) $19.0 million Class C-1 Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 4.0%, (vi) $8.0 million Class C-2 Secured Deferrable Fixed Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at 5.4%, and (vii) $18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 4.8% and (B) the borrowing of $77.5 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.8%, under a credit agreement by and among the Securitization Issuers, as borrowers, various financial institutions, as lenders, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent and as loan agent. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2031. As of both September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $228.0 million, respectively, of 2031 Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% and 2.6%, respectively.\nOn the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Securitization Issuer transferred to us 100% of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, 100% of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. The Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer do not bear interest and had a stated value of $55.4 million at the closing of the Debt Securitization.\nThe 2031 Asset-Backed Debt constitutes secured obligations of the Securitization Issuers, and the indenture governing the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt includes customary covenants and events of default. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt has not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or blue sky laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the SEC or an applicable exemption from registration.\nOur Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager to the Securitization Issuer pursuant to a collateral management agreement between our Investment Adviser and the Securitization Issuer, or the Collateral Management Agreement. For so long as our Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager, it will elect to irrevocably waive any collateral management fee to which it may be entitled under the Collateral Management Agreement.\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into equity distribution agreements (together, as may be amended from time to time, the Equity Distribution Agreements) with each of JMP Securities LLC and Raymond James & Associates, Inc., as the sales agents (each, a Sales Agent, and together, the Sales Agents), in connection with the\nsale of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), with an aggregate offering price of up to $75 million under an at-the-market offering (the ATM Program). On May 5, 2022, we amended the Equity Distribution Agreements to update references from NASDAQ to NYSE and reflect that the agents are now represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP. The Equity Distribution Agreements provide that we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock from time to time through a Sales Agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021we issued 2,464,910 and 108,654 shares of our Common Stock, respectively, under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $13.12 and $12.91 per share, respectively, raising $32.3 million and $1.4 million of gross proceeds, respectively. For the same time period, net proceeds were $31.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, after commissions to the Sales Agents on shares sold. We incurred $0.1 million and $0.4 million , respectively, of legal and other offering costs associated with establishing the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, we had $41.3 million and $73.6 million available under the ATM Program.\nSince inception of the ATM Program through September 30, 2022, we issued 2,573,564 shares of our Common Stock under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $13.11, raising $33.7 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $33.2 million after commissions to the Sales Agents on shares sold. We incurred $0.5 million of legal and other offering costs associated with establishing the ATM Program.\nWe may raise equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off our shelf registration statement and private offerings of securities, securitizing a portion of our investments among other considerations or mergers and acquisitions. Furthermore, the Credit Facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions as discussed in the preceding paragraphs. The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes.\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under our Investment Management Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, in February 2021, PennantPark Investment Advisers serves as our investment adviser. Payments under our Investment Management Agreement in each reporting period are equal to (1) a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our average adjusted gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\nUnder our Administration Agreement, which was most recently reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2022, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administration Agreement was amended on July 1, 2022. If requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, we or the Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided. Payment under our Administration Agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the Administrators overhead in performing its obligations under our Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs.\nIf any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had cash equivalents of $47.9 million and $49.8 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur operating activities used cash of $50.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, and our financing activities provided cash of $47.7 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities used cash primarily for paying down the Credit Facility and paying distributions to stockholders.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $49.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, and our financing activities used cash of $56.3 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities used cash primarily for paying down the Credit Facility and paying distributions to stockholders.\nSenior Securities\nInformation about our senior securities is shown in the following table as of September 30, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by $1,000 to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit.\n(3)\nNot applicable, as senior securities are not registered for public trading in the United States of America.\nPennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC\nIn May 2017, we and Kemper formed PSSL, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, PSSL had total assets of $796.8 million and $603.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was $19.3 million and the five largest investments totaled $86.9 million. As of September 30, 2021, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was $18.9 million and the five largest investments totaled $84.3 million. PSSL invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest.\nWe provide capital to PSSL in the form of first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we and Kemper owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of the same dates, our investment in PSSL consisted of first lien secured debt of $190.2 million (additional $19.9 million unfunded) and $140.9 million (additional $29.4 million unfunded), respectively, and equity interests of $81.5 million (additional $8.5 million unfunded) and $60.4 million (additional $12.6 million unfunded), respectively.\nWe and Kemper each appointed two members to PSSLs four-person board of directors and investment committee. All material decisions with respect to PSSL, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the board of directors or investment committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the board of directors or investment committee, provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each member; (ii) the presence of three members of the board of directors or investment committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed by the member with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the board of directors or investment committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each member.\nIn May 2022 PSSL entered into a $325.0 million (increased from $225.0 million in May 2022) senior secured revolving credit facility which bears interest at daily simple SOFR plus 260 basis points (including a spread adjustment) with Ally Bank through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Facility LLC II, or PSSL Subsidiary II, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nIn January 2021, PSSL completed a $300.7 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, or the 2032 Asset-Backed Debt. The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of PennantPark CLO II, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of PSSL, consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature in January 2032. On the closing date of the transaction, in consideration of PSSLs transfer to PennantPark CLO II, Ltd. of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to PSSL by certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries and us, PennantPark CLO II, Ltd. transferred to PSSL 100% of the Preferred Shares of PennantPark CLO II, Ltd. and 100% of the Class E Notes issued by PennantPark CLO

If any fees were to be charged, they would be separately disclosed in the Statements of Operations.\nDistributions\nIn order to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to not be subject to corporate-level tax on undistributed income or gains, we are required, under Subchapter M of the Code, to annually distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders out of the assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid.\nAlthough not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions in the manner described above, we have retained and may continue to retain such net capital gains or investment company taxable income, subject to maintaining our ability to be taxed as a RIC, in order to provide us with additional liquidity.\nDuring both years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we declared distributions of $1.14 per share for total distributions of $46.7 million and $44.2 million, respectively. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for tax purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of each calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nWe intend to continue to make monthly distributions to our stockholders. Our monthly distributions, if any, are determined by our board of directors quarterly.\nOn November 22, 2017, we terminated our dividend reinvestment plan. The termination of the plan applies to the reinvestment of cash distributions paid on or after December 22, 2017.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage ratio for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in future credit facilities. If we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income annually, we could suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended September30, 2022, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on its consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, or ASU, 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material. Item 7A.\tQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2022, our debt portfolio consisted of 100% variable-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) rate and typically have durations of three months, after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In regards to variable-rate instruments with a floor, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. In contrast, our cost of funds, to the extent it is not fixed, will fluctuate with changes in interest rates since it has no floor.\nAssuming that the most recent Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was to remain constant, and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates:\nChange in Interest Rates\nChange in Interest Income,\nNet of Interest Expense\n(in thousands)\nChange in Interest Income,\nNet of Interest\nExpense Per Share\nDown 1%\n$\n(6,654\n)\n$\n(0.15\n)\nUp 1%\n6,849\n0.15\nUp 2%\n13,622\n0.30\nUp 3%\n20,395\n0.45\nUp 4%\n$\n27,168\n$\n0.60\nAlthough management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations or net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from those shown above.\nBecause we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds, as well as our level of leverage. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income or net assets.\nWe may hedge against interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts or the Credit Facility subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates or higher exchange rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates or investments denominated in foreign currencies. During the periods covered by this Report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities or foreign currency derivatives hedging activities. Item 8.\tConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nPage\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID - 49)\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Net Assets for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Schedules of Investments as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital, Ltd. (except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms we, us, our and PennantPark Investment refer to PennantPark Floating Rate Capital, Ltd. and its Subsidiaries) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nPennantPark Investments internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of PennantPark Investment, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of PennantPark Investments internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on such assessment management has determined that, as of September 30, 2022, we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the material weakness described below.\nA material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting relating to procedures to ensure the timely transmission of portfolio company financial information to our independent valuation services providers. Although this material weakness did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented, there is a possibility they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.\nManagement believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys financial position, results of its operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the periods presented. We believe that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are accurate. We have begun the process of, and we are focused on, further enhancing effective internal control measures to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate this material weakness. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following:\nEnhancing existing controls to ensure the timely transmission of all relevant portfolio company financial information to our independent valuation service providers;\nEnhancing policies and procedures to demonstrate a commitment to improving our overall control environment;\nWe believe our planned actions to enhance our processes and controls will address the material weakness, but these actions are subject to ongoing management evaluation, and we will need a period of execution to demonstrate remediation. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and its Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. and its Subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, by correspondence with the custodians and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not received. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLevel 3 Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Companys investments valued using Level 3 fair value measurements was approximately $1.10 billion as of September 30, 2022. The fair value of the Companys financial instruments classified as liabilities valued using Level 3 fair value measurements was approximately $167.6 million as of September 30, 2022. As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys investment portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, which were acquired directly from the issuer. Such investments include first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. Additionally, the Company has elected to apply the fair value option to certain financial instruments classified as liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nWe identified Level 3 fair value measurements as a critical audit matter due to the subjective nature of the judgments necessary for management to select valuation techniques and the use of significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value. Auditing the reasonableness of managements selection of valuation technique and the related unobservable inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of a valuation specialist.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among others:\nWe obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to managements valuation of Level 3 fair value measurements, including those related to valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness.\nWith the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the selected valuation techniques, and any changes to selected valuation techniques from prior periods, used for Level 3 fair value measurements. We also tested the related significant unobservable inputs by comparing these inputs to external sources.\nWe evaluated managements historical ability to estimate fair value through comparison of previous estimates to the transaction price of available transactions occurring subsequent to the previous valuation date.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2013.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 17, 2022\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.

As defined in the 1940 Act, a company is generally deemed as non-affiliated when we own less than 5% of a portfolio companys voting securities and affiliated when we own 5% or more of a portfolio companys voting securities.\n(5)Non-U.S. company or principal place of business outside the United States.\n(6)Non-income producing securities.\n(7)The securities, or a portion thereof, are not 1) pledged as collateral under the Credit Facility and held through Funding I; or 2) securing the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt (See Note 11) and held through PennantPark CLO I, Ltd.\n(8)Investment is held through our Taxable Subsidiary (See Note 1).\n(9)Represents the purchase of a security with delayed settlement or a revolving line of credit that is currently an unfunded investment.

The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rate (1M L, 2M L, 3M L, or 6M L, respectively), at the borrowers option. All securities are subject to a LIBOR or Prime rate floor where a spread is provided, unless noted. The spread provided includes PIK interest and other fee rates, if any.\n(2)Valued based on our accounting policy (See Note 2). The value of all securities was determined using significant unobservable inputs (See Note 5).\n(3)The provisions of the 1940 Act classify investments based on the level of control that we maintain in a particular portfolio company. As defined in the 1940 Act, a company is generally presumed to be non-controlled when we own 25% or less of the portfolio companys voting securities and controlled when we own more than 25% of the portfolio companys voting securities.\n(4)The provisions of the 1940 Act classify investments further based on the level of ownership that we maintain in a particular portfolio company. As defined in the 1940 Act, a company is generally deemed as non-affiliated when we own less than 5% of a portfolio companys voting securities and affiliated when we own 5% or more of a portfolio companys voting securities.\n(5)Non-U.S. company or principal place of business outside the United States.\n(6)Non-income producing securities.\n(7)The securities, or a portion thereof, are not 1) pledged as collateral under the Credit Facility and held through Funding I; or 2) securing the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt (See Note 11) and held through PennantPark CLO I, Ltd.\n(8)Investment is held through our Taxable Subsidiary (See Note 1).\n(9)Represents the purchase of a security with delayed settlement or a revolving line of credit that is currently an unfunded investment. This security does not earn a basis point spread above an index while it is unfunded.\n(10)The investment is treated as a non-qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, we may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets. As of September 30, 2021, qualifying assets represent 81% of our total assets and non-qualifying assets represent 19% of our total assets.\n(11)Par amount is denominated in Canadian Dollars (C$) as denoted.\nSEE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\n1. ORGANIZATION\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. was organized as a Maryland corporation in October 2010. We are a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. On April 14, 2022, listing and trading of the Company's common stock commenced on the New York Stock Exchange after the Company voluntarily withdrew the principal listing of its common stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC effective at market close on April 13, 2022.\nOur investment objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation while seeking to preserve capital. We seek to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in floating rate loans and other investments made to U.S. middle-market private companies whose debt is rated below investment grade. Floating rate loans pay interest at variable rates, which are determined periodically, on the basis of a floating base lending rate such as LIBOR, with or without a floor, plus a fixed spread. Under normal market conditions, we generally expect that at least 80% of the value of our managed assets will be invested in floating rate loans and other investments bearing a variable rate of interest, which may include, from time to time, variable rate derivative instruments. We generally expect that first lien secured debt will represent at least 65% of our overall portfolio. We generally expect to invest up to 35% of our overall portfolio opportunistically in other types of investments, including second lien secured debt, subordinated debt, and, to a lesser extent, equity investments.\nWe have entered into an investment management agreement, or the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, an external adviser that manages our day-to-day operations. We have also entered into an administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement with the Administrator, which provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate.\nFunding I, our wholly-owned subsidiary and a special purpose entity, was organized in Delaware as a limited liability company in May 2011. We formed Funding I in order to establish the Credit Facility. The Investment Adviser serves as the collateral manager to Funding I and has irrevocably directed that the management fee owed with respect to such services is to be paid to us so long as the Investment Adviser remains the collateral manager. This arrangement does not increase our consolidated management fee. The Credit Facility allows Funding I to borrow up to $366 million at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 225 basis points during the revolving period. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets held by Funding I. See Note 11.\nWe have formed and expect to continue to form certain taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiary, which are subject to tax as corporations. These taxable subsidiaries allow us to hold equity securities of certain portfolio companies treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes while facilitating our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.\nIn May 2017, we and Kemper formed PSSL, an unconsolidated joint venture. PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. See Note 4.\nIn November 2017, we issued $138.6 million of our 2023 Notes. The principal on the 2023 Notes will be payable in four annual installments as follows: 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and 55% on December 15, 2023. The 2023 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2023 Notes are listed on the TASE. In connection with this offering, we have dual listed our common stock on the TASE.\nIn September 2019, the Securitization Issuers completed the Debt Securitization. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of the Securitization Issuer consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2031. On the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Securitization Issuer transferred to us 100% of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, 100% of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. See Note 11.\nIn March 2021 and October 2021, we issued $100.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4% and 101.5% respectively. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.25% per year, commencing October 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on April 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nIn April 2021, we formed PennantPark-TSO Senior Loan Fund LP, (\"PTSF\") , an unconsolidated limited partnership, organized as a Delaware limited liability partnership. We sold $81.4 million in investments to a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTSF in exchange for cash in the amount of $69.5 million and an $11.9 million equity interest in PTSF representing 23.08% of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF. We recognized $0.4 million of realized gain upon the formation of PTSF. As of September 30, 2021, our capital commitment of $15.3 million is fully funded and we hold 23.08% of the total outstanding Class A Units of PTSF and a 4.99% voting interest in the general partner which manages PTSF.\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into equity distribution agreements (together, the Equity Distribution Agreements) with each of JMP Securities LLC and Raymond James & Associates, Inc., as the sales agents, in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), with an aggregate offering price of up to $75 million under an at-the-market offering (the ATM Program). On May 5, 2022, we amended the Equity Distribution Agreements to update references from NASDAQ to NYSE and reflect that the agents are now represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP. The Equity Distribution Agreements, as amended, provide that we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock from time to time through a Sales Agent in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 we issued 2,464,910 and 108,654 shares of our Common Stock, respectively, under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $13.12 and $12.91 per share, respectively, raising $32.3 million and $1.4 million of gross proceeds, respectively. For the same time period, net proceeds were $31.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, after commissions to the Sales Agents on shares sold. We incurred $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of legal and other offering costs associated with establishing the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, we had $41.3 million and $73.6 million available under the ATM Program.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nSince inception of the ATM Program through September 30, 2022, we issued 2,573,564 shares of our Common Stock under the ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $13.11, raising $33.7 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $33.2 million after commissions to the Sales Agents on shares sold. We incurred $0.5 million of legal and other offering costs associated with establishing the ATM Program.\nWe are operated by a person who has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended, or the Commodity Exchange Act, and, therefore, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements have been included. Changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets, the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies and any other parameters used in determining these estimates and assumptions could cause actual results to differ from these estimates and assumptions. We may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. References to the Financial Accounting Standards Boards, or FASBs, Accounting Standards Codification, as amended, or ASC, serve as a single source of accounting literature. Subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed as appropriate for events occurring through the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistent with ASC Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K/Q and Articles 6, 10 and 12 of Regulation S-X, as appropriate. In accordance with Article 6-09 of Regulation S-X, we have provided a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Net Assets in lieu of a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity.\nOur significant accounting policies consistently applied are as follows:\n(a) Investment Valuations\nWe expect that there may not be readily available market values for many of the investments, which are or will be in our portfolio, and we value such investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process, as described in this Report. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate or revise our valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and the difference may be material. See Note 5.\nOur portfolio generally consists of illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n(1)Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;\n(2)Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of the Investment Adviser;\n(3)Our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment. The independent valuation firms review management's preliminary valuations in light of their own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service, broker, dealer or market maker;\n(4)The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of our Investment Adviser and those of the independent valuation firms on a quarterly basis, periodically assesses the valuation methodologies of the independent valuation firms, and responds to and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments; and\n(5)Our board of directors discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee.\nOur board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available. We obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available, or otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available.\n(b) Security Transactions, Revenue Recognition, and Realized/Unrealized Gains or Losses\nSecurity transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering prepayment penalties. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments, the Credit Facility, and the 2023 Notes during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized.\nWe record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we will generally not accrue PIK interest when the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectable. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, or OID, market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on liabilities, which we do not fair value, are capitalized and then accreted or amortized using the effective interest method as interest income or, in the case of deferred financing costs, as interest\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nexpense. We record prepayment penalties earned on loans and debt investments as income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. From time to time, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees and amendment fees, and are recorded as other investment income when earned. Litigation settlements are accounted for in accordance with the gain contingency provisions of ASC Subtopic 450-30, Gain Contingencies, or ASC 450-30.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or if there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon managements judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in managements judgment, are likely to remain current. As of September 30, 2022, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 0.9% and zero of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, we had two portfolio companies on non-accrual, representing 2.7% and 2.6% of our overall portfolio on a cost and fair value basis, respectively.\n(c) Income Taxes\nWe have complied with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Code and have qualified to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. In this regard, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740. Under this method, income taxes are provided for amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Based upon our qualification and election to be treated as a RIC for U.S federal income tax purposes, we typically do not incur any material federal income taxes. However, we may choose to retain a portion of our calendar year income, which may result in the imposition of a federal tax, or we may incur taxes through our taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiary. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 ,and 2020, we recorded a provision for taxes on net investment income of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, pertaining to federal excise tax.\nWe recognize the effect of a tax position in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 740 when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not considered to satisfy the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense or benefit. Penalties or interest, if applicable, that may be assessed relating to income taxes would be classified as other operating expenses in the financial statements. There were no tax accruals relating to uncertain tax positions and no amounts accrued for any related interest or penalties with respect to the periods presented herein. The Companys determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although the Company files both federal and state income tax returns, the Companys major tax jurisdiction is federal.\nThe Taxable Subsidiary is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The income tax expense and related tax liabilities of the Taxable Subsidiary are reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a provision for taxes of $4.6 million on unrealized appreciation on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized a provision for taxes of zero on unrealized appreciation on investments by the Taxable Subsidiary. The provision for taxes on unrealized appreciation on investments is the result of netting (i) the expected tax liability on gains from sales of investments and (ii) the expected tax benefit from the use of losses in the current year. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, $4.6 million and zero, respectively, was accrued as a deferred tax liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities relating to unrealized gain on investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company paid $1.2 million in taxes on realized gains on the sale of investments held by the Taxable Subsidiary which were offset by subsequent realized losses, resulting in a $1.2 million prepaid tax asset as of September 30, 2022 included under prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nBecause U.S. federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences between tax regulations and GAAP may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities to reflect their tax character. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\n(d) Distributions and Capital Transactions\nDistributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid, if any, as a distribution is determined by the board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, may be distributed at least annually. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include ordinary income and capital gains, but may also include certain tax-qualified dividends and/or a return of capital.\nCapital transactions through offerings of our common stock, are recorded when issued and offering costs are charged as a reduction of capital upon issuance of our common stock.\n(e) Foreign Currency Translation\nOur books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:\n1.Fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable period; and\n2.Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses - at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.\nAlthough net assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above, we do not isolate that portion of the results of operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates on investments, other assets and debt from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair value of investments and liabilities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments and liabilities.\nForeign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices to be more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\n(f) Consolidation\nAs permitted under Regulation S-X and as explained by ASC paragraph 946-810-45-3, PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company wholly-owned subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to us. Accordingly, we have consolidated the results of our taxable subsidiaries, including the Taxable Subsidiary, Funding I and the Securitization Issuer in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not consolidate our non-controlling interest in PSSL or PTSF. See further description of our investment in PSSL in Note 4.\n(g) Asset Transfers and Servicing\nAsset transfers that do not meet ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, requirements for sale accounting treatment are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as investments. The creditors of Funding I have received a security interest in all its assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. or any of its affiliates.\n(h) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company utilized the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended September30, 2022, the effect of which was not material to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment, among other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on its consolidated financial statement and disclosures.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, or ASU, 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, or ASU 2022-03, which changed the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. The amendments clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material.\n3. AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n(a) Investment Management Agreement\nThe Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Investment Adviser, in February 2022. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, manages the day-to-day operations of and provides investment advisory services to us. The Investment Adviser serves as the collateral manager to Funding I and has irrevocably directed that any management fee owed with respect to such services is to be paid to the Company so long as the Investment Adviser remains the collateral manager. This arrangement does not increase our consolidated management fee. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us consisting of two components-a base management fee and an incentive fee.\nBase Management Fee\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of our average adjusted gross assets, which equals our gross assets (net of U.S. Treasury Bills, temporary draws under any credit facility, cash and cash equivalents, repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions undertaken at the end of a fiscal quarter for purposes of preserving investment flexibility for the next quarter and unfunded commitments, if any) and is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For example, if we sold shares on the 45th day of a quarter and did not use the proceeds from the sale to repay outstanding indebtedness, our gross assets for such quarter would give effect to the net proceeds of the issuance for only 45 days of the quarter during which the additional shares were outstanding. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021,and 2020, the Investment Adviser earned a base management fee of $11.9 million, $10.7 million, and $11.4, respectively, from us.\nIncentive Fee\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nThe incentive fee has two parts, as follows:\nOne part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as amendment, commitment, origination, prepayment penalties, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies, accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense or amendment fees under any credit facility and distribution paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a percentage of the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). We pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75%, (2) 50% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.9167% in any calendar quarter (11.67% annualized) (we refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.9167%) as the catch-up, which is meant to provide our Investment Adviser with 20% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as if a hurdle did not apply, if this net investment income exceeds 2.9167% in any calendar quarter), and (3) 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.9167% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are pro-rated for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, if applicable. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Investment Adviser earned $11.6 million, $5.3 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, in incentive fees on net investment income from us.\nThe second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Investment Adviser did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement (as described above).\nUnder GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the capital gains incentive fee accrual, we considered the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related to incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such year. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. The incentive fee accrued for but, not payable, under GAAP on our unrealized and realized capital gains for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was zero, respectively.\n(b) Administration Agreement\nThe Administration Agreement with the Administrator was reapproved by our board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of us, in February 2022. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides administrative services and office facilities to us. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Counsel and their respective staffs. The Administrator also offers, on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies to which we are required to offer such assistance. Reimbursement for certain of these costs is included in administrative services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we reimbursed the Administrator approximately $0.6 million, $1.1 million, and $1.6 million , respectively, including expenses the Administrator incurred for services described above.\nOn July 1, 2022, the Administration Agreement with the Administrator was amended to clarify that the Administrator may be reimbursed by the Company for certain (i) tax and general legal advice and/or services provided to the Company by in-house professionals of the Administrator related to ongoing operations of the Company; and (ii) transactional legal advice and/or services provided to the Company or portfolio companies by in-house professionals of the Administrator or its affiliates on matters related to potential or actual investments and transactions, including tax structuring and/or due diligence.\n(c) Other Related Party Transactions\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company made no purchases from and sold zero, zero, and $15.0 million in total, respectively, of investments to an affiliated fund managed by our Investment Adviser in accordance with, and pursuant to procedures adopted under, Rule 17a-7 of the 1940 Act. Net realized losses on those sales for the same periods amounted to zero, zero, and $1.0 million, respectively.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we sold $275.6 million, $285.8 million, and $86.7 million of investments, respectively, in investments to PSSL at fair value and recognized $0.8 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million of net realized gains (loss) for the same periods, respectively.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we sold zero and $81.4 million, respectively, in investments to PTSF at fair value and recognized zero million and $0.5 million, respectively of net realized gains.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.

PSSL invests primarily in middle-market and other corporate debt securities consistent with our strategy. PSSL was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, PSSL had total assets of $796.8 million and $603.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was $19.3 million and the five largest investments totaled $86.9 million. As of September 30, 2021, at fair value, the largest investment in a single portfolio company in PSSL was $18.9 million and the five largest investments totaled $84.3 million. PSSL invests in portfolio companies in the same industries in which we may directly invest.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nWe provide capital to PSSL in the form of first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we and Kemper owned 87.5% and 12.5%, respectively, of each of the outstanding first lien secured debt and equity interests. As of the same dates, our investment in PSSL consisted of first lien secured debt of $190.2 million (additional $19.9 million unfunded) and $140.9 million (additional $29.4 million unfunded), respectively, and equity interests of $81.5 million (additional $8.5 million unfunded) and $60.4 million (additional $12.6 million unfunded), respectively.\nWe and Kemper each appointed two members to PSSLs four-person board of directors and investment committee. All material decisions with respect to PSSL, including those involving its investment portfolio, require unanimous approval of a quorum of the board of directors or investment committee. Quorum is defined as (i) the presence of two members of the board of directors or investment committee, provided that at least one individual is present that was elected, designated or appointed by each member; (ii) the presence of three members of the board of directors or investment committee, provided that the individual that was elected, designated or appointed by the member with only one individual present shall be entitled to cast two votes on each matter; and (iii) the presence of four members of the board of directors or investment committee shall constitute a quorum, provided that two individuals are present that were elected, designated or appointed by each member.\nIn May 2022 PSSL entered into a $325.0 million (increased from $225.0 million in May 2022) senior secured revolving credit facility which bears interest at daily simple SOFR plus 260 basis points (including a spread adjustment) with Ally Bank through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Facility LLC II, or PSSL Subsidiary II, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nIn January 2021, PSSL completed a $300.7 million debt securitization in the form of a collateralized loan obligation, or the 2032 Asset-Backed Debt. The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by a diversified portfolio of PennantPark CLO II, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary of PSSL, consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans. The 2032 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature in January 2032.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value, as defined under ASC 820 is the price that we would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment or liability. ASC 820 emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available to us on the reporting period date.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies:\nLevel 1: Inputs that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term, if applicable, of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3: Inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.\nA financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Generally, most of our investments, our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt and the Credit Facility are classified as Level 3. Our 2026 Notes are classified as Level 2 as they are financial instruments with readily observable market inputs. Our 2023 Notes are classified as Level 1, as they were valued using the closing price from the primary exchange. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the price used in an actual transaction may be different than our valuation and those differences may be material.\nThe inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data is available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information, disorderly transactions or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence were available. Corroborating evidence that would result in classifying these non-binding broker/dealer bids as a Level 2 asset includes observable orderly market-based transactions for the same or similar assets or other relevant observable market-based inputs that may be used in pricing an asset.\nOur investments are generally structured as floating rate loans, mainly first lien secured debt, but also may include second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments. The transaction price, excluding transaction costs, is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception. Ongoing reviews by our Investment Adviser and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties, expected cash flows and market-based information including comparable transactions, performance multiples and yields, among other factors. These non-public investments valued using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nA review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in our ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities.\nIn addition to using the above inputs to value cash equivalents, investments, our 2023 Notes, our 2026 Notes, our 2031 Asset-Backed Debt and the Credit Facility, we employ the valuation policy approved by our board of directors that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with our valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading, in determining fair value. See Note 2.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nAs outlined in the table below, some of our Level 3 investments using a market approach valuation technique are valued using the average of the bids from brokers or dealers. The bids include a disclaimer, may not have corroborating evidence, may be the result of a disorderly transaction and may be the result of consensus pricing. The Investment Adviser assesses the source and reliability of bids from brokers or dealers. If the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such bids do not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investment by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available. In accordance with ASC 820, we do not categorize any investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe remainder of our investment portfolio and our long-term Credit Facility are valued using a market comparable or an enterprise market value technique. With respect to investments for which there is no readily available market value, the factors that the board of directors may take into account in pricing our investments at fair value include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the pricing indicated by the external event, excluding transaction costs, is used to corroborate the valuation. When using earnings multiples to value a portfolio company, the multiple used requires the use of judgment and estimates in determining how a market participant would price such an asset. These non-public investments using unobservable inputs are included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the sensitivity of unobservable inputs or combination of inputs such as industry comparable companies, market outlook, consistency, discount rates and reliability of earnings and prospects for growth, or lack thereof, affects the multiple used in pricing an investment. As a result, any change in any one of those factors may have a significant impact on the valuation of an investment. Generally, an increase in a market yield will result in a decrease in the valuation of a debt investment, while a decrease in a market yield will have the opposite effect. Generally, an increase in an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, multiple will result in an increase in the valuation of an investment, while a decrease in an EBITDA multiple will have the opposite effect.\nOur Level 3 valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges were categorized as follows for ASC 820 purposes ($ in thousands):\nAsset Category\nFair value at September 30, 2022\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Input\nRange of Input\n(Weighted Average) (1)\nFirst lien\n$\n70,363\nMarket Comparable\nBroker/Dealer bids\nor quotes\nN/A\nFirst lien\n930,806\nMarket Comparable\nMarket Yield\n8.2% - 21% (10.9%)\nFirst lien\n8,473\nEnterprise Market Value\nEBITDA multiple\n14.0\nSecond lien\nMarket Comparable\nMarket Yield\n0.147\nSecond lien\n-\nEnterprise Market Value\nEBITDA multiple\n6.0x\nEquity\n89,906\nEnterprise Market Value\nEBITDA multiple\n3.3x - 21.4x (12.5x)\nEquity\n5,232\nEnterprise Market Value\nDLOM\n11.8%\nTotal Level 3 investments\n$\n1,104,927\nLong-Term Credit Facility\n$\n167,563\nMarket Comparable\nMarket Yield\n2.5%\nAsset Category\nFair value at September 30, 2021\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Input\nRange of Input\n(Weighted Average) (1)\nFirst lien\n$\n177,480\nMarket Comparable\nBroker/Dealer bids\nor quotes\nN/A\nFirst lien\n754,004\nMarket Comparable\nMarket Yield\n5.6% - 13.0% (7.5%)\nSecond lien\n8,085\nMarket Comparable\nMarket Yield\n11.0% - 14.0% (11.8%)\nFirst lien\n2,934\nEnterprise Market Value\nEBITDA multiple\n1.8x\nSecond lien\nEnterprise Market Value\nEBITDA multiple\n5.4x\nEquity\n70,253\nEnterprise Market Value\nEBITDA multiple\n4.7x - 18.5x (11.5x)\nEquity\n7,569\nEnterprise Market Value\nDLOM\n9.3%\nTotal Level 3 investments\n$\n1,021,189\nLong-Term Credit Facility\n$\n218,851\nMarket Comparable\nMarket Yield\n2.1%\n(1)The weighted averages disclosed in the table above were weighted by their relative fair value.\nOur investments, cash and cash equivalents, Credit Facility or Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, 2023 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2031 Asset-Backed Debt were categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy for ASC 820 purposes ($ in thousands):\nFair Value at September 30, 2022\nDescription\nFair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nMeasured at Net\nAsset Value (1)\nFirst lien\n$\n1,009,642\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,009,642\n$\n-\nSecond lien\n-\n-\n-\nEquity\n154,465\n-\n-\n95,138\n59,327\nTotal investments\n1,164,254\n-\n-\n1,104,927\n59,327\nCash and cash equivalents\n47,880\n47,880\n-\n-\n-\nTotal investments and cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,212,134\n$\n47,880\n$\n-\n$\n1,104,927\n$\n59,327\nCredit Facility payable\n$\n167,563\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n167,563\n$\n-\n2023 Notes payable\n96,812\n96,812\n-\n-\n-\n2026 Notes payable (2)\n182,276\n-\n182,276\n-\n-\n2031 Asset-Backed Debt(2)\n226,128\n-\n-\n226,128\n-\nTotal debt\n$\n672,779\n$\n96,812\n$\n182,276\n$\n393,691\n$\n-\n(1)In accordance with ASC Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820-10, our equity investment in PSSL and PTSF are measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient for fair value, and thus have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(2)We elected not to apply the fair value option allowed by ASC 825-10 to the 2026 Notes and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt and thus the balance reported in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities represents the carrying value, which approximates the fair value.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.

We have adopted the principles under ASC Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments, or ASC 825-10, which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and made an irrevocable election to apply ASC 825-10 to the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes. We elected to use the fair value option for the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes to align the measurement attributes of both our assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes. Due to that election and in accordance with GAAP, we incurred expenses of $0.4 million, $2.9 million and zero relating to amendment costs on the Credit Facility and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. ASC 825-10 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to more easily understand the effect on earnings of a companys choice to use fair value. ASC 825-10 also requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We elected not to apply ASC 825-10 to any other financial assets or liabilities, including our 2026 Notes and 2031 Asset-Backed Debt.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of $(4.9) million, $(11.6) million, and $14.2 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the net unrealized depreciation on the Credit Facility or our Prior Credit Facility, as applicable, the 2023 Notes totaled $1.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively. We use a nationally recognized independent valuation service to measure the fair value of the Credit Facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that the board of directors uses to value our investments. Our 2023 Notes trade on the TASE and we use the closing price on the exchange to determine the fair value.\n6. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES\nAn affiliated portfolio company is a company in which we have ownership of 5% or more of its voting securities. A portfolio company is generally presumed to be a non-controlled affiliate when we own at least 5% but 25% or less of its voting securities and a controlled affiliate generally when we own more than 25% of its voting securities.

TAXES AND DISTRIBUTIONS\nDistributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal tax regulations, which may materially differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, they are reclassified to undistributed net investment income, accumulated net realized gain or paid-in-capital, as appropriate. Distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, are normally declared and paid annually, but the Company may make distributions on a more frequent basis to comply with the distribution requirements for RICs under the Code.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes approximates amortized cost reported in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash equivalents represent cash in money market funds pending investment in longer-term portfolio holdings. Our portfolio may consist of temporary investments in U.S. Treasury Bills (of varying maturities), repurchase agreements, money market funds or repurchase agreement-like treasury securities. These temporary investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are deemed cash equivalents and are included in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. At the end of each fiscal quarter, we may take proactive steps to preserve investment flexibility for the next quarter by investing in cash equivalents, which is dependent upon the composition of our total assets at quarter-end. We may accomplish this in several ways, including purchasing U.S. Treasury Bills and closing out positions on a net cash basis after quarter-end, temporarily drawing down on the Credit Facility, or utilizing repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions as are deemed appropriate for this purpose. These amounts are excluded from average adjusted gross assets for purposes of computing the Investment Advisers management fee. U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities greater than 60 days from the time of purchase are valued consistent with our valuation policy. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds in the amounts of $47.9 million and $49.8 million at fair value, respectively.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.

As of September 30, 2022, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that we are in compliance with a 150% asset coverage ratio requirement after such borrowing.\nOn April 5, 2018, our board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA). As a result, the asset coverage requirement applicable to us for senior securities was reduced from 200% (i.e., $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity) to 150% (i.e., $2 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), effective as of April 5, 2019, subject to compliance with certain disclosure requirements. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 178% and 175%, respectively.\nCredit Facility\nFunding Is multi-currency Credit Facility with affiliates of Truist Bank (formerly SunTrust Bank), or the Lenders was $366.0 million as of September 30, 2022, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC, has an interest rate spread above SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) of 225 basis points, a maturity date of August 2026 and a revolving period that ends in August 2024. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, Funding I had $168.8 million and $219.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, respectively. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 4.7% and 2.3%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $197.2 million and $80.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, respectively, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions.\nDuring the revolving period, the Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 225 basis points and, after the revolving period, the rate will reset to Base Rate (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) plus 250 basis points for the remaining two years, maturing in August 2026. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding I. Both we and Funding I have made customary representations and warranties and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities.\nThe Credit Facility contains covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions of loan size, industry requirements, average life of loans, geographic and individual portfolio concentrations, minimum portfolio yield and loan payment frequency. Additionally, the Credit Facility requires the maintenance of a minimum equity investment in Funding I and income ratio as well as restrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt. The Credit Facility compliance reporting is prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants relating to the Credit Facility.\nWe own 100% of the equity interest in Funding I and treat the indebtedness of Funding I as our leverage. Our Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager to Funding I under the Credit Facility.\nOur interest in Funding I (other than the management fee) is subordinate in priority of payment to every other obligation of Funding I and is subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in the Credit Facility. We may receive cash distributions on our equity interests in Funding I only after it has made all required payments of (1) cash interest and, if applicable, principal to the Lenders, (2) administrative expenses and (3) claims of other unsecured creditors of Funding I. The Investment Adviser has irrevocably directed that any management fee owed with respect to such services is to be paid to the Company so long as the Investment Adviser remains the collateral manager.\n2023 Notes\nIn November 2017, we issued $138.6 million of our 2023 Notes of which $97.0 million and $117.8 million were outstanding as at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 2023 Notes were issued pursuant to a deed of trust between the Company and Mishmeret Trust Company, Ltd. as trustee.\nThe 2023 Notes pay interest at a rate of 4.3% per year. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2018. The principal on the 2023 Notes will be payable in four annual installments as follows: 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and 55% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2023.\nThe 2023 Notes are general, unsecured obligations, rank equal in right of payment with all of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd.s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are generally redeemable at our option. The deed of trust governing the 2023 Notes includes certain customary covenants, including minimum equity requirements, and events of default. Please refer to the deed of trust filed as Exhibit (d)(8) to our post-effective amendment filed on December 13, 2017 for more information. The 2023 Notes are rated ilA- by S&P Global Ratings Maalot Ltd. and are listed on the TASE. In connection with this offering, we have dual listed our common stock on the TASE.\nThe 2023 Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, such registration requirements.\n2026 Notes\nIn March 2021 and in October 2021, we issued $100.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of $185.0 million of our 2026 Notes at a public offering price per note of 99.4% and 101.5%, respectively. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, at a rate of 4.25% per year, commencing October 1, 2021. The 2026 Notes mature on April 1, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option subject to a make-whole premium if redeemed more than three months prior to maturity. The 2026 Notes are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles, or similar facilities. We do not intend to list the 2026 Notes on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system.\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022\n2031 Asset-Backed Debt\nIn September 2019, the Company completed the $301.4 million term debt securitization. Term debt securitizations, also known as CLOs, are a form of secured financing incurred by the Company, which is consolidated by the Company and subject to the Companys asset coverage requirements. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt was issued by the Securitization Issuer. The 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is secured by the middle market loans, participation interests in middle market loans and other assets of the Securitization Issuer. The Debt Securitization was executed through (A) a private placement of: (i) $78.5 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans maturing 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.8%, (ii) $15.0 million Class A-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at 3.7%, (iii) $14.0 million Class B-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 2.9%, (iv) $16.0 million Class B-2 Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at 4.3%, (v) $19.0 million Class C-1 Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 4.0%, (vi) $8.0 million Class C-2 Secured Deferrable Fixed Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at 5.4%, and (vii) $18.0 million Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Loans due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 4.8% and (B) the borrowing of $77.5 million Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031, which bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 1.8%, under a credit agreement by and among the Securitization Issuers, as borrowers, various financial institutions, as lenders, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent and as loan agent. The annualized interest on the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt will be paid, to the extent of funds available. The reinvestment period of the Debt Securitization ends on October 15, 2023 and the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is scheduled to mature on October 15, 2031.\nOn the closing date of the Debt Securitization, in consideration of our transfer to the Securitization Issuer of the initial closing date loan portfolio, which included loans distributed to us by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Securitization Issuer transferred to us 100% of the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer, 100% of the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes issued by the Securitization Issuer, and a portion of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt. The Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer do not bear interest and had a stated value of approximately $55.4 million at the closing of the Debt Securitization.\nThe 2031 Asset-Backed Debt is included in the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as debt of the Company and the Class D Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes and the Preferred Shares of the Securitization Issuer were eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $228.0 million, respectively, 2031 Asset-Backed Debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% and 2.6%, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the unamortized fees on the 2031 Asset-Backed Debt were $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nOur Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager to the Securitization Issuer pursuant to the Collateral Management Agreement. For so long as our Investment Adviser serves as collateral manager, it will elect to irrevocably waive any collateral management fee to which it may be entitled under the Collateral Management Agreement.\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, we, the Investment Adviser or the Administrator may be a party to legal proceedings, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. Unfunded debt and equity investments, if any, are disclosed in the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $150.6 million and $166.9 million, respectively, in commitments to fund investments. Additionally, as described in Note 4, the Company had unfunded commitments of up to $28.4 million and $42.0 million to PSSL as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, that may be contributed primarily for the purpose of funding new investments approved by the PSSL board of directors or investment committee.\n13. UNCONSOLIDATED SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES\nWe must determine which, if any, of our unconsolidated controlled portfolio companies is a \"significant subsidiary\" within the meaning of Regulation S-X. We have determined that, as of September 30, 2022, PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC triggered at least one of the significance tests. As a result and in accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, separate audited financial statements of PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are being filed herewith as Exhibit 99.3 and Exhibit 99.4.\nSupplementary Data\nSelected Quarterly Data (Unaudited)\n(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) Item 9.\tChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A.\tControls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2022, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, due to the material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page 60 of this Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.\nNotwithstanding the material weakness, management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys financial position, results of its operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for the periods presented.\n(b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page 60 of this Form 10-K, is incorporated by reference herein.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPlease see Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which appears on page 60 of this Form 10-K for a description of a material weakness identified by Management.
