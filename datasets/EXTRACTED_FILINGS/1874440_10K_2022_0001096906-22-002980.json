ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nNeither we nor our sole officer, director or holder of five percent or more of our common stock is a party to any pending legal proceedings and to the best of our knowledge, no such proceedings by or against us or our officers, or directors or holders of five percent or more of its common stock have been threatened or is pending against us. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot Applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5: MARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED VICTORIA LAKE, INC. MATTERS\nMarket Price and Stockholder Matters\nThe Companys common stock is listed on the OTC Markets Pink tier under the ticker LVCA. Currently, the Company has a Stop warning from OTC Markets and there is only a limited, sporadic, and volatile market for our stock on the OTC.  ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company is considered a start-up company with no assets and/or capital and no material operations or income. Ongoing expenses, including the costs associated with the preparation and filing of annual and quarterly reports, have been paid for by the Companys sole officer and director, Reed Petersen, which are evidenced on the Companys financial statements as accounts payable-related parties. It is anticipated that the Company will require only nominal capital to maintain its corporate viability. Additional necessary funds will most likely be provided by Mr. Petersen, although there is no agreement related to future funds and there is no assurance such funds will be available. However, unless the Company is able to facilitate an acquisition of or merger with an operating business or is able to obtain significant outside financing, there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nPLAN OF OPERATION\nOur plan of operations is to raise debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete this series of transactions. In particular, there is no assurance that any such business will be located or that any stockholder will realize any return on their shares after such a transaction. Any merger or acquisition completed by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our current stockholders.\nOur intended budget for the next twelve months is as follows:\nQ1 three months ended August 31, 2022\nQ2 three months ended November 30, 2022\nQ3 three months ended February 28, 2023\nQ4 three months ended May 31, 2023\nTwelve Month\nTotal\nAccounting\n$\n5,000\n$\n5,000\n$\n5,000\n$\n5,000\n$\n20,000\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n3,000\n$\n3,000\n$\n3,000\n$\n3,000\n$\n12,000\nMiscellaneous\n$\n2,000\n$\n2,000\n$\n2,000\n$\n2,000\n$\n8,000\nTotal Operating Expenses\n$\n10,000\n$\n10,000\n$\n10,000\n$\n10,000\n$\n40,000\nAt this time, we have no cash on hand, and we are dependent on advances from our shareholders or our sole officer/director. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding these sources.\nAs of the date of this Report we intend to engage in what we believe to be synergistic acquisitions or joint ventures with a company or companies that we believe will enhance our business plan. The Company will not restrict its search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and it may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature. One of the benefits to our being a reporting and publicly traded company is to allow us to utilize our securities as consideration for some or all of the purchase price of these potential acquisitions. There are no assurances we will be able to consummate any acquisitions using our securities as consideration, or at all.\nThere are numerous things that will need to occur in order to allow us to implement this aspect of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan.\nManagement will seek out and evaluate businesses for acquisition. The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with managements standards. Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidates business. If we are successful in our attempts to acquire a company or companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution.\nIn implementing a structure for a particular acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, asset purchase, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management and shareholders will no longer be in control of our Company.\nAs part of our investigation, our officers and directors will meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an acquisition will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and other parties, the management of the acquisition candidate and our relative negotiation strength.\nWe will participate in an acquisition only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.\nDepending upon the nature of the acquisition, including the financial condition of the acquisition company, as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (34 Act ), it will be necessary for such acquisition candidate to provide independent audited financial statements. We will not acquire any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance with the requirements of the 34 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the agreement will also contain a provision providing for the acquisition entity to reimburse us for all costs associated with the proposed transaction.\nAs of the date of this Report we are not engaged in discussions with any concerning any potential merger or acquisition. We will not engage in any discussions concerning any merger or acquisition until a minimum of sixty (60) days has elapsed since the filing of our annual report. There are no assurances that any material acquisition will occur in the future.\nWe believe there are certain perceived benefits to being a public company whose securities are publicly traded, including the following:\n\u00b7\nincreased visibility in the financial community;\n\u00b7\nincreased valuation;\n\u00b7\ngreater ease in raising capital;\n\u00b7\ncompensation of key employees through stock options for which there may be a market valuation; and\n\u00b7\nenhanced corporate image.\nThere are also certain perceived disadvantages to being a trading company including the following:\n\u00b7\nrequired publication of corporate information;\n\u00b7\nrequired filings of periodic and episodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBusiness entities, if any, which may be interested in a combination with us may include the following:\n\u00b7\na company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses;\n\u00b7\na company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it;\n\u00b7\na company which wishes to become public with less dilution of its securities than would occur upon an underwriting;\n\u00b7\na company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public;\n\u00b7\na foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market;\n\u00b7\na special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan;\n\u00b7\na company seeking one or more of the other perceived benefits of becoming a public company.\nA business combination with a private company will normally involve the transfer to the private company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the private company of its own management and board of directors.\nThe proposed business activities described herein classify us as a shell company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and certain states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations regarding the sales of securities of shell companies, as well as limitations on a shareholders ability to sell their restricted securities. Rule 144 is not available to a shareholder of a shell company unless and until the Company files a registration statement with the SEC that includes certain specific information about existing business operations of a registrant and thereafter must wait an additional one year to take advantage of that exemption from registration.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING AT MAY 7, 2021 (INCEPTION), THROUGH MAY 31, 2021 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2022.\nRevenue\nWe recognized no revenue during the year ended May 31, 2022 or from May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021. We had no business from which to generate revenues in the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nCost of Revenue\nWe recognized no cost of revenue during the year ended May 31, 2022 or from May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2022, we incurred administrative expenses of $13,410 as compared to the year ended May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021 of $1,445.\nProfessional Fees\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2022, we incurred professional fees of $2,264 as compared to the year ended May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021 of $625.\nOperating Loss\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2022, we incurred an operating loss of $15,674, an increase of $13,604 due to an increase in general, selling and administrative expenses as stated above, as compared to May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021 of $2,070.\nInterest and Other Income (Expenses)\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2022 and from May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021, we recognized no interest expense or other income (expenses).\nNet Loss\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of $15,674, an increase of $13,604, due to the factors discussed above as compared to May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021 of $2,070.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt May 31, 2022, we had cash of $0, no assets, no operating business or other source of income, liabilities of $17,744, and a stockholders deficit of $17,744, as compared to at May 31, 2021, we did not have any assets, no operating business or other source of income, liabilities of $2,070, and a stockholders deficit of $2,070.\nWe are now focused raising debt and/or equity financing to meet ongoing operating expenses and attempting to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There is no assurance that this series of events will be satisfactorily completed.\nConsequently, we are now dependent on raising additional equity and/or debt to meet our ongoing operating expenses. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary equity and/or debt that we will need to fund our ongoing operating expenses.\nIt is our current intention to seek to raise debt and/or equity financing to meet ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our\ncommon stock to create value for our shareholders. There is no assurance that this series of events will be satisfactorily completed.\nFuture losses are likely to occur as, until we are able to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders as we have no sources of income to meet our operating expenses. As a result of these, among other factors, we received from our registered independent public accountants in their report for the financial statements for the period ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFrom Inception on\nMay 7, 2021\nYear Ended\nThrough\nMay 31, 2022\nMay 31, 2021\nNet Cash from Operating Activities\n$\n-\n$\n-\nNet Cash from Investing Activities\n-\n-\nNet Cash from Financing Activities\n-\n-\nNet change in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n$\n-\n$\n-\nOperating Activities\nFrom inception on May 7, 2021 through May 31, 2021, and during the year ended May 31, 2022, we used $0 and $0 in operating activities, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nFrom inception on May 7, 2021 through May 31, 2021, and during the year ended May 31, 2022, we used $0 and $0 in investing activities, respectively.\nFinancing Activities\nFrom inception on May 7, 2021 through May 31, 2021, and during the year ended May 31, 2022, we used $0 and $0 in financing activities, respectively.\nWe are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, we are dependent upon our controlling shareholder to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our plan of operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAll companies are required to include a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of their financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nInflation\nIn the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future.\nManagement will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPer SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. As of May 31, 2022, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot required ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA ITEM 9: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). Based on that evaluation, we concluded that because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not sufficient as of May 31, 2022.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of our financial statements and related information. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements present accurately, in material respects, our financial position and results of operations in fairness and conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange Act. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate, and that the assumptions and opinions in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently, an ineffective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with our managements and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and published in 2013, and subsequent guidance prepared by COSO specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not sufficient as of May 31, 2022.\nA significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, that adversely affects the entitys ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entitys financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected by the entitys internal control. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following material weakness in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2022:\n\u00b7\nThe Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked personnel with accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\n\u00b7\nMaterial Weakness - Inadequate segregation of duties.\nWe expect to be materially dependent on a third party that can provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements, which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and maintained, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must account for resource constraints. In addition, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, can and will be detected.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended May 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B: OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nItem 9C: DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot Applicable.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nVictoria Lake, Inc.\nSalt Lake City, UT\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Victoria Lake, Inc. (the Company) as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2022 and from May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended May 31, 2022 and from May 7, 2021 (inception) through May 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nConsideration of the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has no operations which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nPinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah\n(a dba of Heaton & Company, PLLC)\nPCAOB ID: 6117\nFarmington, Utah\nDecember 15, 2022\nVICTORIA LAKE, INC.\nBalance Sheets\nASSETS\nFrom Inception on May 7, 2021 through\nMay 31\nMay 31,\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash\n$\n-\n$\n-\nTotal Current Assets\n-\n-\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$\n-\n$\n-\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n5,395\n$\n-\nAccounts payable -

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nReorganization Activities:\nDomiciliary Merger: On April 5, 2021, the predecessor issuer, Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. of Nevada, completed a domiciliary merger into Redo Development, Inc. of Oklahoma, with the Oklahoma company being the survivor under the name Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc., pursuant to a concurrent name change.\nHolding Company Parent/Subsidiary Formation: On May 7, 2021, Victoria Lake, Inc. an Oklahoma Corporation became the parent/successor issuer pursuant to Section 1081(g) of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act under an executed agreement titled Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (Parent Subsidiary Formation) which was executed by Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (OK), Victoria Lake, Inc. (OK), and Lake Express, Inc. (OK). Under the terms of the Agreement, Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (OK) merged into Lake Express, Inc. (OK) and Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (OK) ceased to exist, wherein Lake Express, Inc. (OK) became the survivor and successor under Section 1088 of the Oklahoma Act, having acquired all of Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc.s (OK) assets, rights financial statements, obligations, and liabilities as the constituent or resulting corporation. Victoria Lake, Inc. (OK) became the parent and the holding company of Lake Express, Inc. (OK) under the Parent Subsidiary Formation which was in compliance with Section 1081(g) of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act.\nUpon consummation of the Parent Subsidiary Formation, each issued and outstanding equity of the former Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (OK) was transmuted into and represented the identical equity structure of Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (NV) that existed prior to the domiciliary change and immediately prior to the Reorganization (on a share-for-share basis) having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions. Upon consummation of the Agreement, Victoria Lake, Inc. (OK), was the issuer since the former Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (OK) equity structure was transmuted pursuant to Section 1081(g) as the current issued and outstanding equities of Victoria Lake, Inc. (OK). The subsidiary, Lake Express, Inc. was divested on May 7, 2021 and therefore is no longer consolidated into Victoria Lake, Inc. The shareholders of the Company became the shareholders of Lake Victoria Mining Company, Inc. (NV).\nAs a result of this reorganization, the resulting reorganized Company name became Victoria Lake, Inc. (Victoria Lake, the Company, we, or us).\nThe Companys fiscal year-end is May 31.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and (iii) the reported amount of net revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements; accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nVICTORIA LAKE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2022 & 2021\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions. ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. We have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions, and identified the U.S. federal as our \"major\" tax jurisdiction. However, we have certain tax attribute carryforwards which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized.\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share\nBasic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period presented. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of potential common shares is not reflected in diluted earnings per share because the Company incurred a net loss and the effect of including these potential common shares in the net loss per share calculations would be anti-dilutive.\nThe total potential common shares for the years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021 include 300,005,100 shares for Series B convertible preferred stock.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for employees and nonemployees is measured at the fair value of the equity award on the grant date. Share-based compensation for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company's financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accrued expenses and accounts payable - related party. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements (\"ASC Topic 820\"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard also prioritizes, within the measurement of fair value, the use of market-based information over entity-specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.\nVICTORIA LAKE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2022 & 2021\nThe three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is defined as follows:\n\u00b7\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; liabilities in active markets;\n\u00b7\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices, either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active; or directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active;\n\u00b7\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has evaluated other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As of May 31, 2022, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, has accumulated losses of $17,744 since its inception, has a working capital deficiency of $17,744 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances, however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available or on terms acceptable to the Company.\nNOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDuring the periods ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, our sole officer and director, G. Reed Petersen, paid various expenses on behalf of the Company totaling $10,279 and $2,070, respectively, resulting in amounts owed to Mr. Petersen of $12,349 and $2,070 at May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs the Companys office space needs are limited at the current time, Mr. Petersen is currently providing space to the Company at no cost.\nNOTE 5 - EQUITY\nThe total number of shares of stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue is 600,000,000 shares, of which 500,000,000 shares of $0.00001 par value shall be designated as Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares of $0.00001 shall be designated as Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock authorized by these Articles of Incorporation may be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors of the Corporation is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions granted or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and within the limitations or restrictions stated in any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of shares constituting any series, to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of any such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, to determine the designation and par value of any series and to fix the numbers of shares of any series.\nVICTORIA LAKE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2022 & 2021\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has authorized 500,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.00001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought.\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe Company designated 1,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share.\nInitially, there will be no dividends due or payable on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Any future terms with respect to dividends shall be determined by the Board consistent with the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation (Certificate). Any and all such future terms concerning dividends shall be reflected in an amendment to the Certificate, which the Board shall promptly file or cause to be filed. All shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall rank pari passu with the Companys common stock and the Series A Convertible Preferred shall have no liquidation preference over any other class of stock.\nEach holder of outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to one hundred (1,000) votes for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders. Except as provided by law, or by the provisions establishing any other series of Preferred Stock, holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and of any other outstanding series of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.\nEach holder of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may, at any time and from time to time, convert (an Optional Conversion) each of their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock. In the event of a reverse split or a forward split shall occur, then in each instance the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted such that the number of shares issued upon conversion of one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will equal the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued but for such Event.\nAs of May 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 0 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred outstanding.\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe Company designated 3,000,051 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share.\nInitially, there will be no dividends due or payable on the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Any future terms with respect to dividends shall be determined by the Board consistent with the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation (Certificate). Any and all such future terms concerning dividends shall be reflected in an amendment to the Certificate, which the Board shall promptly file or cause to be filed. All shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall rank pari passu with the Companys common stock and the Series B Convertible Preferred shall have no liquidation preference over any other class of stock.\nEach holder of outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to one hundred (100) votes for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders. Except as provided by law, or by the provisions establishing any other series of Preferred Stock, holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and of any other outstanding series of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.\nVICTORIA LAKE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2022 & 2021\nEach Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a conversion rate of 100 shares of Common Stock for each Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Each holder of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may, at any time and from time to time, convert (an Optional Conversion) each of their shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into one hundred fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock. In the event of a reverse split or a forward split shall occur, then in each instance the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted such that the number of shares issued upon conversion of one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will equal the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued but for such Event.\nAs of May 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 3,000,051 shares of Series B Preferred issued and outstanding.\nSeries L Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn May 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Cancellation Agreement with the G. Reed Petersen Revocable Trust and Jeff Holmes for the cancellation of the 2,000 outstanding Series L Preferred stock owned by the G. Reed Petersen Revocable Trust and Jeff Holmes.\nAs of May 19, 2021, the Series L Preferred Stock had been retired to treasury.\nAs of May 31, 2021, there were 0 shares of Series L Preferred outstanding.\nOn the 22nd day of June 2021, the Series L Preferred Stock Designation was terminated.\nNOTE 6 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties since inception.\nFuture tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax losses.\nThe Companys federal income tax returns since inception remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service as of May 31, 2022.\nThe income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the Federal income tax at the expected rate of 21% due to the following:\nYear Ended\nMay 31,\nFrom Inception on May 7, 2021 through May 31,\nIncome tax provision\n$ (3,292)\n$ (435)\nChange in Valuation allowance\n3,292\nNet provision for Federal income taxes\n$ -\n$ -\nNet deferred tax assets are comprised as follows:\nDeferred tax asset attributable to:\nNet operating loss carryover\n$ 3,727\n$ 435\nLess: valuation allowance\n(3,727)\n(435)\nNet deferred tax asset\n$ -\n$ -\nVICTORIA LAKE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2022 & 2021\nAs of May 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has taxable net loss carryovers of approximately $17,744 and $2,070, respectively, that may be offset against future taxable income.\nNOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that these financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\nPART III ITEM 10: DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth the names, ages, and positions with us for each of our directors and officers as May 31, 2022:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nG. Reed Petersen\nPresident, CFO, Director, Secretary and Treasurer\nG. Reed Petersen, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer\nMr. G Reed Petersen, our sole officer and director, was appointed as President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer on May 7, 2021. He is the sole officer and director of our Company.\nG. Reed Petersen, age 76, and a resident of the State of Nevada, has been a private investor since 1995. From January 2016 until November 29, 2016, Mr. Peterson was the controlling stockholder and sole executive officer and director of Allied Ventures Holding Corp., which at the time was inactive and deemed to be a public shell company. In connection with the change of control, Mr. Petersen sold all his shares to the new control group for approximately $75,000, and Allied changed its name to Longwen Group Corp. Mr. Petersen was the controlling stockholder and sole officer and director of Kreido Biofuels, Inc., which at the time was inactive and deemed to be a public shell company, from November 2017 to June 5, 2018, when he sold control of that company for $320,000. Mr. Petersen gained control of a small public company, whereafter he redomiciled the corporation to Nevada, and changed the name to Revival Inc. In June 2019, he was involved with the acquisition of a private company by Revival Inc. while he was President. Mr. Petersen retained his 660,001 shares of common stock in Revival but otherwise received no consideration for the change of control. After his resignation as president, that company, now Farmhouse Inc. completed an S-1 offering. Mr. Petersen is the promotor of our Company as defined in Item 401(g). Within the past ten years, Mr. Petersen has not been involved in any legal proceeding identified in Item 401(F) of Regulation S-K.\nMr. Petersen is currently the Director of Entertainment Holdings, Inc., an Oklahoma Company with a Form 10 undergoing current comments by the SEC. Mr. Petersen has been the sole director and majority shareholder holding 87% of Entertainment Holdings, Inc.s outstanding common shares, since he acquired its predecessor issuer, XRX International Entertainment Holding Group, Inc. on May 5, 2021. Entertainment Holdings, Inc. is the successor issuer of XRX International Entertainment Holding Group, Inc. since the two companies executed and entered into a parent subsidiary formation on June 30, 2021. Mr. Petersen is currently the Director of Myson, Inc., an Oklahoma Company with a Form 10 undergoing current comments by the SEC. Mr. Petersen has been the sole director and majority shareholder holding 99% of Myson, Inc.s outstanding shares, since he acquired its predecessor issuer Myson Group, Inc. on June 20, 2021. Myson, Inc. is the successor issuer of Myson Group, Inc. since the two companies executed and entered into a parent subsidiary formation on July 8, 2021.\nConflicts Of Interest - General\nOur directors and officers are, or may become, in their individual capacities, officers, directors, controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, there exist potential conflicts of interest including, among other things, time, efforts and corporation opportunity, involved in participation with such other business entities. While our sole officer and director of our business is engaged in business activities outside of our business, he devotes to our business such time as he believes to be necessary. At this time, G. Reed Petersen has conflicts of interest with Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and Myson, Inc. of which he is director and president of both companies. There exist specific conflicts of interest between Mr. Petersen, the above companies, and our Company. Our Company and the above listed companies are held and controlled by Mr. Petersen as shell companies that will seek to acquire target operating businesses at a future date. At that time, Mr. Petersen will have to use his discretion and sound judgment in matching our Company with the right operating business and may weight the use of any corporate opportunity to choose one of the other companies as a more viable candidate.\nConflicts Of Interest - Corporate Opportunities\nPresently no requirement contained in our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or minutes which requires officers and directors of our business to disclose to us business opportunities which come to their attention. Our officers and directors do, however, have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us to disclose to us any business opportunities which come to their attention, in their capacity as an officer and/or director or otherwise. Excluded from this duty would be opportunities which the person learns about through his involvement as an officer and director of another company. We have no intention of merging with or acquiring an affiliate, associate person or business opportunity from any affiliate or any client of any such person.\nCommittees Of The Board Of Directors\nIn the ordinary course of business, the board of directors maintains a compensation committee and an audit committee.\nThe primary function of the compensation committee is to review and make recommendations to the board of directors with respect to the compensation, including bonuses, of our officers and to administer the grants under our stock option plan.\nThe functions of the audit committee are to review the scope of the audit procedures employed by our independent auditors, to review with the independent auditors our accounting practices and policies and recommend to whom reports should be submitted, to review with the independent auditors their final audit reports, to review with our internal and independent auditors our overall accounting and financial controls, to be available to the independent auditors during the year for consultation, to approve the audit fee charged by the independent auditors, to report to the board of directors with respect to such matters and to recommend the selection of the independent auditors.\nIn the absence of a separate audit committee our board of directors functions as audit committee and performs some of the same functions of an audit committee, such as recommending a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial statements; reviewing the independent auditors independence, the financial statements and their audit report; and reviewing management's administration of the system of internal accounting controls.
