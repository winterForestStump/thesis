    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nWe are a leading operator of government health and human services programs and provider of technology solutions to governments. We are a responsible and reliable contracting partner to governments under our mission of Moving People Forward. Governments rely on our financial stability and proven expertise in helping people connect and use critical government programs. We use our experience, business process management expertise, innovation, and technology solutions to help government agencies run effective, efficient, and accountable programs.\nOur primary portfolio of work is business process services (\"BPS\") in the health and human services markets. Our growth over the last decade was driven by new work, an evolving digital transformation effort to meet the modernization needs of our clients, and a growing footprint in clinical services including assessments, appeals, and independent medical reviews in multiple geographies. Over the past decade, legislative and environmental circumstances have driven our growth. The 2010 Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") in the United States (\"U.S.\") created new and enhanced BPS opportunities for both states and the federal government clients. Since the enactment of the law, we have been a go-to service provider for services such as government health insurance program administration, eligibility and enrollment services, and consumer outreach and education. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic created new opportunities for our U.S. Services and Federal segments. In fiscal year 2021, we were successful in winning new contracts tied to public health initiatives such as vaccine information hotlines and unemployment insurance to help governments respond to COVID-19 crises. While most new COVID-19 related work was short-term, by creating and building positive client relationships, we have been successful in securing several longer-term projects.\nOur growth has been supplemented by strategic acquisitions. We have an active program to identify potential strategic acquisitions to enable long-term, sustainable, organic growth by continuing to build scale, enhance our clinical and digital capabilities, and extend into new market areas. As we evaluate potential acquisitions, we are mindful of our goal to create long-term shareholder value. Our recent acquisitions further our progress on our long-term strategy, discussed in greater detail below. An overview of recent acquisitions include:\nIn October 2021, we acquired the U.S. Department of Education-owned loan servicing contract from Navient. Rebranded as \"Aidvantage,\" the acquisition expanded our track record for supporting Federal Student Aid (\"FSA\") and demonstrates our strategic commitment to providing strong customer service supported by leading digital capabilities.\nIn September 2021, we acquired Connect Assist, a market-leading provider of contact center and digital services in the United Kingdom. The Connect Assist partnership is expected to strengthen our already formidable customer service and digital capabilities as we continue our expansion into new markets.\nIn May 2021, we acquired VES Group, Inc. (\"VES\"), a leading provider of Medical Disability Examinations (\"MDEs\") for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\"VA\"). This acquisition accelerates our clinical evolution to meet long-term demand for BPS with a clinical dimension.\nIn March 2021, we acquired the Federal business of Attain, LLC (\"Attain\"). The additional capabilities from Attain meaningfully expand our technology consulting and growing systems integration skills, increasing our ability to address the most pressing information technology (\"IT\") needs of our Federal clients while providing internal opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of our BPS operations. Attain is delivering on complex program challenges for critical clients, while gaining the ability to bid on larger opportunities through newly available contract vehicles.\nAs the pandemic has underscored, governments around the world need better solutions to deliver on policy priorities that can change rapidly. Social welfare programs that reflect long-term societal commitments and priorities increasingly face rising demand, shifting demographics, and unsustainable program costs. Maximus is well-positioned to address these challenges and be a transformative partner through our scalable, cost-effective, and operationally efficient services for a wide range of government programs.\nWe have refreshed our strategy and updated the three pillars on which we will focus growth efforts for the next three to five years:\nCustomer Services, Digitally Enabled. We apply proven technologies, data, and best practices to make government programs more customer-focused, effective, and deserving of the public's trust. We make it easier for people to connect to government services based on their individual preferences and abilities. We are elevating the customer experience to achieve higher levels of satisfaction, performance, and outcomes through intelligent automation and cognitive computing.\nFuture of Health. We are expanding our clinical-related services and are experienced at delivering clinical BPS at scale. We have established an extensive set of services that frequently requires a network of healthcare professionals who can complete clinical assessments, provide occupational health and independent medical review services, and adjudicate complicated benefits appeals. With the formation of Maximus Public Health (\"MPH\"), we are able to serve as a resource to governments as they respond to public health threats.\nAdvanced Technologies for Modernization. We are furthering our credibility as a technology leader, enabling the transformation of government programs to be resilient, dynamic, integrated and equitable. Leveraging our deep relationships and program knowledge, we are delivering technology-driven business transformation of government missions with a strategic near-term focus on hybrid cloud solutions, information intelligence, and hyper-automation. We believe that these technologies can help our government clients run their programs in a more streamlined manner and make it easier for individuals to interact with these programs.\nMore information on how each of our business segments align with the execution of our strategy is provided below. Across all segments, there is a common focus on optimizing processes and simplifying our structure. We also continue to focus on our people - the foundation of our strategy. Our commitment to making Maximus an employer of choice is not a new goal, and we continue to prioritize attracting, retaining, developing, and empowering employees as a central part of our plan for achieving future growth. More information on our Human Resource priorities is included below.\nOur Business Segments\nWe operate our business through three segments: U.S. Federal Services, U.S. Services, and Outside the U.S. We operate in the U.S., Australia, United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Italy, South Korea, Sweden, and United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\").\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 47% of our revenue was derived from U.S. Federal Government agencies, 35% from U.S. state government agencies, 16% from foreign government agencies, and the balance from other sources, including local municipalities and commercial customers.\nFor more information on our segment presentation and geographic distribution of our business, including comparative revenue, gross profit, operating income, identifiable assets, and related financial information for the 2022, 2021, and 2020 fiscal years, see \"Note 3. Business Segments\" within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nU.S. Federal Services Segment\nOur U.S. Federal Services Segment generated 49% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022.\nOur U.S. Federal Services Segment delivers end-to-end solutions that help various U.S. federal government agencies better deliver on their mission, including program operations and management, clinical services, and technology solutions. The segment also contains certain state-based assessments and appeals work that is part of the segment's heritage within the Medicare Appeals portfolio.\nProgram Operations. Program Operations include business process services, eligibility and enrollment, outreach, and other services for federal health and human services programs. In fiscal year 2022, our contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to support the Contact Center Operations (\"CCO\") was renewed. This contract supports the federal marketplace under the ACA and serves as the primary support engagement center for Medicare, also known as 1-800-MEDICARE. The contract serves the U.S. population through eleven customer contact centers handling general inquiries for the marketplace and general and claims-based Medicare inquiries.\nIn October 2021, we acquired the Navient student loan contract, rebranded as Aidvantage. We are an independent and conflict-free provider, as we will not provide loan origination, consolidation, or collection services. We view student loan servicing as an opportunity to apply our insights, expertise, and quality-driven approach through support for Federal Student Aid (\"FSA\"), and student borrowers. Aidvantage is an extension of long-standing work supporting student loan management and is in line with our core business. Our focus is solely on supporting the student borrowers on behalf of FSA.\nThe manner in which we provide these services varies from contract to contract but may include a mix of contact centers, mail-room operations, and mobile and website media.\nClinical Services. In line with our strategic focus for the future, the segment continues to expand its clinical solutions. This is evident in the acquisition of VES, which manages the clinical evaluation process for U.S. veterans and service members on behalf of the VA and the clinical offerings in public health including work supporting the federal government's COVID-19 response efforts.\nA leading provider of MDEs, VES brings a deep and longstanding relationship with the VA, as well as a team of experienced clinicians focused on serving veterans. While our independent clinical assessments business has been growing at the state level (through our previous acquisition of Ascend and subsequent organic growth), VES' expertise provides a platform of scale for the first time at the Federal level. We believe that-near term growth should also be realized as a result of the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (\"PACT\") Act, passed in August 2022. The PACT Act expands certain conditions under which veterans would presumptively qualify for benefits and would result in increases in MDE volumes. We expect to realize and deliver on higher volumes related to the PACT Act beginning in fiscal year 2023.\nThe independent health and disability assessments and appeals portion of our business will comprise a larger share of our overall portfolio, lending further credibility to our organic growth efforts with other Federal departments and in non-Federal markets.\nThis segment performed some services to assist the U.S. federal government response to the pandemic, including contact tracing and vaccine distribution support.\nTechnology Solutions. Also aligned with our strategic focus, and benefiting from the Attain platform, the Technology and Consulting Services (\"TCS\") division executes on its digital strategy to deliver technology solutions that advance agency missions, including the challenge to modernize, provide better customer experience, and drive process efficiencies. The TCS division is comprised of experts who helped successfully pioneer the first large-scale implementation of a cloud-computing solution for a federal department. TCS's core capabilities build further upon our cloud-based solutions and include:\nApplication development & modernization: Modernize, develop, and deliver solutions utilizing automation, agile, and DevSecOps practices.\nEnterprise Business Solutions: Integrate and manage disparate business processes and systems.\nAdvanced Analytics & Emerging Technologies: Provide technology services to leverage and integrate the latest technologies for AI and machine learning, automation, and high-performance computing.\nCybersecurity: Deliver full spectrum cybersecurity services, including cyber engineering and operations, digital forensics, and incident response.\nInfrastructure and Engineering: Deploy solutions that leverage cloud-hosted and on-premise designs to optimize costs.\nTCS has also built digital qualifications in the market. The division utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to build bespoke data models, providing predictive analytics to maximize process efficiency, as well as identify systemic process issues that can be isolated and prioritized for troubleshooting. End-to-end automation of software development and business processes achieves speed, efficiency, and error reduction as well as advanced tool capabilities resulting in greater operational efficiency, enhanced customer experiences, and increased ROI. Finally, high performance computing clusters support mission requirements for data mining, scientific modeling, advanced analytics, research, and machine learning.\nThe segment contains performance-based contracts where revenue is earned based upon participant numbers or other transaction-based measures, such as the number and type of assessments or appeals processed. Many contracts in this segment earn their revenue on a cost-plus or time-and-materials basis, which typically carry lower levels of risk and lower levels of profit margin as compared to performance-based contracts. The segment may experience fluctuations as a result of volume variations or program maturity, with contracts recording lower revenue and profitability during program startup.\nOur primary competitors in the U.S. Federal Services Segment are Serco, General Dynamics Information Technology, Amentum, Cognosante, and Conduent. Within the technology sector, our primary competitors are IBM, Oracle, Leidos, Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, and other federal contractors.\nU.S. Services Segment\nOur U.S. Services Segment generated 35% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022.\nOur U.S. Services Segment provides a variety of BPS such as program administration, appeals and assessments, and related consulting work for U.S. state and local government programs. These services support a variety of programs, including ACA, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\"), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (\"TANF\"), and child support programs. As part of the governments' COVID-19 response efforts, the segment supported contact tracing, disease investigation, and vaccine distribution support services during the peak of the pandemic. The segment also successfully expanded into the unemployment insurance market where longer term opportunities have materialized. As part of the broader strategy to evolve clinically and address societal macro trends such as aging populations and rising costs, the segment continues to expand its offerings in public health with new work in in-person assessments.\nProgram Operations. Program operations includes our comprehensive program administration services for government health benefit programs. The services we provide vary from program to program but may include:\nProgram eligibility support and enrollment services to help beneficiaries make the best choice for their health insurance coverage to improve their access to healthcare;\nCentralized multilingual customer contact centers and multichannel, digital self-service options for simplified enrollment to better serve citizens' needs;\nApplication assistance and independent health plan choice counseling to beneficiaries; and\nBeneficiary outreach, education, eligibility assistance, enrollment, and redeterminations services. In programs such as Medicaid, Maximus does not make the final determination of eligibility.\nWe also provide some specialized services, including substance abuse, diversion program support and administration of subsidized telephony services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided support in contact tracing.\nAs a leading player in many of the health program administration markets that we serve, we believe we are one of the largest providers of Medicaid enrollment services in the U.S and that we are a leading provider of CHIP services and state-based health insurance exchange operations.\nClinical Services. This service type includes our independent appeals and person-centered assessments services, primarily under Medicaid Long-Term Care. The growth of our clinical services demonstrates successful execution of our continued strategy and focus on clinical services. These services help governments engage with program recipients while at the same time help them improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, quality, and accountability of their health and disability benefits programs. These include person-centered independent disability, long-term sick, and other health assessments, including those related to long-term services and supports such as Preadmission Screening and Resident Reviews (\"PASRR\") and Independent Developmental Disability (\"IDD\") assessments. We are a leading provider of such services in the U.S. In addition, we provide connected wellness services which promote healthy living habits amongst participants.\nEmployment Services. Employment services cover a number of attributes, including eligibility support, case management, job-readiness preparation, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services, including vocational training. Maximus supports 14 states and their efforts with unemployment insurance. These contracts were initially procured in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but have transitioned into long-term programs. Children services include full and specialized child support case management services, including collection of child-support funds, through customer contact center operations and program and systems consulting services.\nTechnology Solutions. Technology solutions offer assistance with system planning, implementation oversight and the construction and maintenance of client systems to allow processing of transactions. We also provide system implementation project management services to state and local clients, giving our customers peace of mind that their business requirements have been met on time and within budget. Consistent with our overall corporate strategy, technology solutions in our U.S. Services Segment is an area of focus for growth.\nThe rest of the segment's revenue is from specialized consulting services. These services include business process assessment and design, quality assurance processes, including independent verification and validation services as well as policy and procedure reviews, and audit preparation and compliance, including grant and proposal reviews. The segment also includes a tax credit service, which assists commercial customers in claiming workforce and location-based tax benefits.\nPayment for our services varies from contract to contract based upon factors such as the priorities of the customer and their willingness to share risks and rewards. Some contracts are performed on a cost-plus basis, where we receive revenue based upon the hours and costs incurred and typically operate at lower margins. Most contracts include a level of performance-based compensation, a fixed fee, or a mixture of both, with fees being based upon call volumes, populations served, or appeals processed. Our employment services contracts typically have outcome-based payments in an effort to incentivize providers to ensure that we help job seekers find long-term sustained employment and achieve economic independence.\nThe segment may experience seasonality due to transaction-based work, such as program open enrollment periods. Other fluctuations may arise from changes in programs directed by our clients and activity related to contract life cycles. Contracts with government clients often contain \"termination without cause\" provisions. Such contractual language generally allows the government to terminate a contract at any time and enables us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses and profit, if any, on the work completed prior to termination.\nA small number of large states comprise a significant share of this segment's revenue. In addition, even though the majority of our direct clients are state governments, a significant amount of our revenue is ultimately funded via the U.S. Federal Government in the form of cost-sharing arrangements with the states, as is the case with Medicaid.\nOur primary competitors are government in-sourced operations. External competitors include Conduent, Automated Health Systems, Faneuil, KePro, MTX Group, and Deloitte. In some services, we compete against specialized private companies and nonprofit organizations such as The Salvation Army and Goodwill Industries. We consider ourselves to be a significant competitor in the markets in which we operate as we are one of the largest providers of Medicaid and CHIP administrative programs and operate many of the state-based health insurance exchanges.\nOutside the U.S. Segment\nOur Outside the U.S. Segment generated 16% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022.\nOur Outside the U.S. Segment provides BPS for international governments and commercial clients, transforming the lives of people around the world. Helping people find employment, access vital support, and remain healthy, these services include health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other job seeker-related services. We support programs and deliver services in the U.K., including the Health Assessment Advisory Service (\"HAAS\") and Restart; Australia, including Workforce Australia (formerly jobactive) and Disability Employment Service; Canada, including Health Insurance British Columbia and the Employment Program of British Columbia; in addition to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and UAE, where we predominantly provide employment support and job seeker services.\nEmployment Services. Comprehensive employment services help vulnerable individuals transition from government assistance programs to sustainable employment and economic independence. These services cover a number of attributes, including eligibility determination, case management, job-readiness preparation and work capability assessments, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services. Payment terms are typically focused on achieving employment outcomes.\nClinical Services. Clinical services includes appeals and assessments work. On these contracts, we are typically reimbursed for each transaction. The HAAS contract is a hybrid contract with cost-plus elements coupled with a number of incentives and penalties to achieve the programmatic outcomes defined by the government in order to ensure quality and timeliness of service to our customers. Maximus carries out these assessments on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (\"DWP\"), and the DWP makes the final decision on the level of benefit.\nThe balance of the segment provides program administration and some specialized services.\nSeasonality is not significant to this segment. Contracts with government clients often contain \"termination without cause\" provisions. Such contractual language generally allows the government to terminate a contract at any time and enables us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses and profit, if any, on the work completed prior to termination.\nOur primary competitors in this segment include Atos, Capita, Optum, Serco, Staffline, Shaw Trust, Ingeus, Sarina Russo, Advanced Personnel Management, IBM, Telus-Health, NTT Data, Pacific Blue Cross, and other specialized private companies and nonprofit organizations. Although the basis for competition varies from contract to contract, we believe that typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of comprehensive solution and price. In some cases, clients award points for past performance tied to program outcomes.\nEconomic and Market Environments\nIn all the markets and locations in which we operate, we are seeing consistent themes that drive our long-term strategy.\nInvestment in Technology. Many federal agencies must address the maintenance of legacy IT systems and the pressing need for IT infrastructure modernization continues to grow. Legacy processes and systems are fundamental to government operations, yet they are expensive to operate in an environment that requires online agility and rapid response to new demands, requirements, and global challenges. We are delivering and supporting the priorities set by the Federal CIO: Cybersecurity, IT modernization, and customer service and customer experience. By aligning our priorities with that of the government, we believe that we are well-positioned to meet agency change and to provide enterprise-wide solutions and strategies.\nPublic Health Emergency. We believe that effectively managing healthcare costs, as well as improving quality and access to healthcare, is a major policy priority for governments. This was particularly evident in the federal government's Public Health Emergency (\"PHE\"), which increased Medicaid funding to states that allowed ongoing eligibility of benefits. While the PHE has impacted our volumes and revenues on certain Medicaid eligibility contracts, our teams are actively preparing for the lift of the PHE by collaborating with current and prospective state clients.\nFurther, President Biden has indicated that his healthcare platform will use the foundation of the ACA to expand access, lower costs, and simplify the process for individuals and families. We believe the current market environment for our services positions us to benefit from continued demand across all of our geographies in service areas such as operations program management and independent health and benefit assessments. Overall, we still expect the underlying demand for our services to increase over the next several years, particularly as economies emerge from this global health crisis.\nDecentralization. The U.S. federal government recently clarified federal regulations that now allow states the flexibility to use contractors to help agencies provide services. We anticipate future changes to this operating model as states evaluate options such as replacing staff, retaining contractors, and implementing technology. We believe that these changes to funding and government mechanics allow state and local authorities enhanced flexibility to shape their benefit programs.\nUnemployment. As different geographies emerge from the pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic that new opportunities for expanded employment services programs will materialize. Given our deep experience, strong financial condition, and trusted brand reputation, we believe we are well-positioned with unique competitive advantages to meet an anticipated expanded need for our services and pent-up demand to help governments provide their citizens employment opportunities. Furthermore, this segment has historically benefited from increased caseloads in employment services programs during past economic downturns and recoveries.\nCompetitive Advantages\nSome of the competitive advantages that allow us to capitalize on various market opportunities are as follows:\nSubject matter, clinical, and digital expertise. Our workforce includes many individuals who possess substantial subject matter expertise in areas critical to the successful design, implementation, administration, and operation of government health and human services programs. We also employ a diverse set of experts, including a wide network of clinicians and an experienced team of digital technologists. Many of our employees worked for governments in management positions and can offer insights into how we can best provide valuable, practical, and effective services to our clients.\nDigital engagement, analytics, and automation solutions to enhance government programs. Participants in government programs expect the same types of digital engagement they rely upon when interacting with consumer-oriented businesses. We believe our clients value our ability to infuse digital, such as mobile applications, omnichannel solutions, and digital media, into our BPS solutions to make it easier for beneficiaries to engage with government programs. Analytics enable us to optimize our operations and provide our clients with improved outcomes through greater insight into the populations we serve. Process automation incorporated into our BPS solutions increases the efficiency and quality of the programs we operate.\nFlexibility and scalability. We are experienced in launching large-scale complex operations under compressed time frames. We offer clients the flexibility and scalability to deliver the people, processes, and technology to complete short- and long-term contractual assignments in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nFinancial strength. Our business provides us with robust cash flows from operations as a result of our profitability and our management of customer receivables. In the event that we have significant cash outlays at the commencement of projects or where delays in payments result in short-term working capital needs, we may borrow up to $600 million through a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase N.A. (the Credit Agreement), subject to standard covenants. We have the ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement in all of the principal currencies in which we operate. We believe we have strong, constructive relationships with the lenders on the Credit Agreement. We believe our financial strength provides reassurance to government agencies that we will be able to establish and maintain the services they need to operate high-profile public health and human services programs.\nFocused portfolio of services. We are one of the largest publicly traded companies that provide a portfolio of BPS almost exclusively to government customers. Our government program expertise and proven ability to deliver defined, measurable outcomes differentiate us from other firms and nonprofit organizations, including large consulting firms that serve multiple industries and lack the focus necessary to manage the complexities of serving government efficiently.\nEstablished presence outside the United States. Governments outside the U.S. are seeking to improve government-sponsored health and human services programs, manage increasing caseloads, and contain costs. We have an established presence in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Italy, Sweden, South Korea, and UAE. Our international efforts are focused on delivering cost-effective welfare-to-work and health benefits services to program participants on behalf of governments.\nExpertise in competitive bidding. Government agencies typically award contracts through a comprehensive, complex, and competitive request for proposals (\"RFP\") and bidding process. Although the bidding criteria varies from contract to contract, typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of technical solution and price. In some cases, governments award points for past performance tied to program outcomes. With more than 40 years of experience in responding to RFPs, we believe we have the necessary experience to navigate government procurement processes and to assess and allocate the appropriate resources necessary for successful project completion in accordance with contractual terms.\nBarriers to entry. The market for providing our services to government agencies is competitive and subject to rapid change. However, given the specialized nature of our services, market entry can be difficult for new or inexperienced firms. The complex nature of competitive bidding, qualifying criteria related to past performance, the required investment in subject-matter expertise, repeatable processes and support infrastructure, and the need to achieve specific program outcomes creates barriers to entry for potential new competitors unfamiliar with the nature of government procurement. In some areas of our business, notably contracts with the U.S. federal government, there are requirements for bidders seeking contracts to be pre-approved on registered contract vehicles, further limiting the pool of competitors.\nHuman Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 39,500 employees and 12,550 contingent workers, consisting of 18,500 employees in our U.S. Federal Services Segment, 10,350 employees in the U.S. Services Segment, 8,400 employees in the Outside the U.S. Services Segment and 2,250 corporate administrative employees.\nGlobal Core Values\nIn fiscal year 2022 we announced Global Core Values to establish a universal voice throughout the Company. These values focus on elements of our strategic objectives with input solicited from our employees, globally, taking into consideration not only where we are but where we want to be. The six global core values that were identified are Respect, Compassion, Innovation, Accountability, Collaboration, and Customer Focus. These values are a mix of our current beliefs and our aspirations, illustrating how we can execute our strategic objectives and look for opportunities of growth.\nTalent Acquisition\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract talent globally to meet the needs of our customers and comply with our contracts. This makes our hiring efforts significant and extensive, and as a result, our talent acquisition team focuses on finding top, diverse talent quickly. We believe our culture values individual skills, experiences, and differences that allow Maximus to deliver robust and innovative approaches to solving some of our communities' most challenging needs. Our recruiting programs focus on identifying and evaluating talent through practices that welcome a diverse workforce, including people with disabilities, language barriers, and those from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.\nDemand for talent is highly competitive, with additional pressures influenced by the pandemic. We continue to invest in our employees through a variety of benefits and overall program enhancements. Our teams continue to adapt to the recruiting, hiring, and training needs of our customers in both remote and onsite settings to ensure continuity of vital services.\nTalent Development\nWe value ongoing development and continuous learning, and we strive to support and provide learning opportunities to all Maximus employees. Maximus supports enterprise-wide professional development by offering a variety of instructor-led and self-paced learning programs for diverse audiences ranging from individual contributors to frontline supervisors and executive leadership. Additionally, our project training teams manage customized programs supporting contract requirements, customer service, local leadership development, and employee engagement. We also provide online learning tools that have role-based and skill-based paths to many of our employees.\nTotal Rewards\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we offer and maintain market-competitive total rewards programs for our employees to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include incentive bonus opportunities, restricted stock units, company-matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and supplemental programs to support our employees' physical, mental, and financial well-being.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, we made significant improvements to the employee value proposition, including increasing the 401(k)-employer match, removing the vesting schedule for all new matching contributions and lowering the deductible for our most populated SCA medical plan, from $4,500 to $2,500, in order to make healthcare more accessible for our mission-critical employees. We also made great strides in closing the gender and ethnicity pay gap, instituting an annual review to identify and close any new or persistent unsubstantiated differences in pay between our employees.\nWe improved the hourly wage in fiscal year 2022 to at least $15 an hour for approximately 95% of our U.S. population. We also developed a plan to get the remaining contracts to that internal minimum wage and ultimately to a living wage.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe assist some of the most vulnerable individuals and families each day. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to our company identity. We are proud to contribute to and positively impact our communities by treating every person we serve, and each other, with dignity and respect. We assert that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces creative solutions, innovative products and services, and attracts and retains key talent. We are focused on building and sustaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture through a variety of initiatives, including implementing international and strategic hiring, internal development, promotions, and retention practices. In 2022, we successfully sourced and employed more than 2,500 persons with disabilities in the U.S. 70% of our U.S. hires were People of Color, and over 75% of our total U.S. hires were women. We continue to refine our focus on recruiting employees from under-represented and historically excluded groups, People of Color, and military Veterans at all levels of the organization to better reflect the populations we serve.\nEmployee Engagement\nOur employees are essential, and their well-being is paramount. During the pandemic, we launched a global engagement survey to measure our employees engagement for being stewards of Maximus. Engaged employees typically stay longer, provide a better consumer experience, and influence other employees. Since weve launched the survey, our Global engagement score has increased by over 250%.\nFreedom of Association\nApproximately 5% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements. No other employees are covered under any similar agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nRunning our Business Ethically and with Integrity\nOur commitment to conduct our business ethically and with integrity extends to our responsibility to respect human rights as guided by international human rights principles. It is our duty to conduct our business through responsible workplace practices as described in the Maximus Human Rights Principles, available at www.maximus.com.\nWe strive to be champions for an inclusive and collaborative culture that is free from discrimination and harassment, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Our expectation is that Maximus and its employees always conduct business according to the highest standards of ethics and performance and in compliance with all applicable laws.\nMaximus has a confidential, third-party-operated, 24/7 reporting ethics hotline. Violations of our ethics standards and policies are taken seriously and include remediation processes and disciplinary action, as applicable. Any director, officer, or employee may anonymously report suspected violations of the Maximus Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics, Company policies, or applicable laws and regulations.\nThe ethics hotline is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool to assist management and employees in working together to address any type of misconduct in the workplace. Maximus is committed to an environment where open, honest communications are the expectation, not the exception. We want employees to feel comfortable in approaching a supervisor or anyone in management in instances where they believe violations of policies or standards have occurred. By creating open channels of communication, we aim to promote a positive work environment.\nEmployees understand our commitment to act with integrity, which is summarized in our Standards for Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes the confidential ethics hotline contact information and is available at www.maximus.com.\nCyber Security\nOur government clients maintain the role as data owners and regulate access to and use of this data through extensive federal, state, and international privacy and data security laws requiring certain privacy protections and security safeguards. Our Information Security Office is led by the Chief Information Security Officer to provide oversight over the Company's security obligations, as well as a Privacy Office under the Privacy Official to provide oversight over our privacy obligations within these contracts. The Board of Directors Technology Committee provides oversight with respect to our global IT, including, but not limited to, IT infrastructure, product development, digital services portfolio, cybersecurity, IT aspects of mergers and acquisitions, and intellectual property protection. Maximus uses various technological and procedural security measures in order to protect the personal information we collect from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. We have documented Information Security & Privacy policies to address data protection. We regularly provide information security and privacy awareness training to our employees.\nEnvironment\nOur operations may be subject to various local, state, federal, and international environmental laws and regulations. Given the nature of our business, we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with, or the liabilities associated with, environmental laws will materially affect us. However, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. The Board of Directors' Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight responsibility for Environment, Social, and Governance (\"ESG\") matters, which includes climate-related risks and opportunities.\nGovernment Regulations\nOur business is heavily regulated. In the U.S., we must adhere to local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Within the U.S. Federal Services Segment, we must also comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\"FAR\"), which regulates the procurement, award, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Outside the U.S., we must also comply with local laws and regulations as determined by geography, as well as U.S. government laws. Adherence includes human rights protections, environmental regulation, and contract specifications. Our government clients have strict policies, procedures, and requirements in the procurement process, as well as regulations governing contract pricing and reimbursable costs.\nCommunity Involvement\nWe aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer employees the opportunity to give back through the Maximus Foundation. The Foundation focuses our grant giving to carefully selected partners who have the expertise and capability to enhance our communities and the quality of life of the people we serve. We provide financial support for nonprofit organizations and charities that share our commitment in helping disadvantaged populations and underserved communities.\nOther Information\nMaximus, Inc. is a Virginia corporation founded in 1975.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1600 Tysons Boulevard, McLean, Virginia, 22102.

Risk Factors\nOur operations are subject to many risks that could adversely affect our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and, therefore, the market value of our securities. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and, in the future, could affect our operations. Additional risks we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Pertaining to the Performance of Our Business\nIf we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations or to meet performance standards, our contracts may be terminated, and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including actual or liquidated damages and penalties, which could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and our ability to compete for future contracts.\nOur contracts may be terminated due to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations or to meet performance standards and often require us to indemnify customers for their damages. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures. Although we have errors and omissions insurance, the policy coverage and limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities. Further, for certain contracts, we may post significant performance bonds or issue letters of credit to secure our performance, indemnification, and other obligations. If a claim is made against a performance bond or letter of credit, we may be required to reimburse the issuer for the amount of the claim. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could adversely impact our operating results, cash flows, financial condition, and our ability to compete for future contracts.\nIf we fail to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing, we may generate less profit than expected or incur losses on those contracts.\nWe derived approximately 14% of our fiscal year 2022 revenue from fixed-price contracts and approximately 45% of our fiscal year 2022 revenue from performance-based contracts. For fixed-price contracts, we receive our fee based on services provided. Those services might include operating a Medicaid enrollment center pursuant to specified standards, designing and implementing information systems or applications, or delivering a planning document under a consulting arrangement. For performance-based contracts, we receive our fee on a per-transaction basis or upon meeting specified milestones. These contracts include workforce services contracts in which we receive a payment based on a participant maintaining employment for a specified time period. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate the likely volume of work that will occur, costs, and resource requirements involved and assess the probability of completing individual transactions or milestones within the contracted time period. If our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may not achieve the level of profit we expected or we may incur a net loss on a contract.\nOur growth initiatives could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may encounter start-up challenges, new compliance requirements, unforeseen costs, and other risks as we enter these markets. If we are unable to manage the risks of operating in these new markets, our reputation, and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur significant costs before receiving related contract payments, which could result in an increased use of cash and risk of impairment charges.\nFrom time to time, when we are awarded a contract, we incur significant expenses before we receive any contract payments. These expenses include leasing and outfitting office space, purchasing office equipment, and hiring personnel. In other situations, contract terms provide for billing upon achievement of specified project milestones. As a result, in these situations, we are required to expend significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments. In addition, payments due to us from government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures by the government to approve governmental budgets in a timely manner. In addition to these factors, poor execution on project startups could impact us by increasing our use of cash.\nIn certain circumstances, we may defer recognition of costs incurred at the inception of a contract. That deferral assumes we will be able to recover these costs over the life of the contract. To the extent that a project does not perform as anticipated, these deferred costs may not be considered recoverable resulting in an impairment charge.\nOur business could be materially and adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and resulted in travel and work restrictions, commercial disruptions, and affected companies' operations around the world. We have been and continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including through operational disruptions and changes in working practices. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be adversely impacted. If our operations are materially restricted, we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase significantly as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nDuring 2022, the spread of COVID-19 led to disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the cost of capital and impede our ability to access capital if we need to do so in the future.\nWe continue to work with our customers, employees, and suppliers to responsibly address this global pandemic. We will continue to monitor the situation, assess further possible implications to our business and our stakeholders, and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts.\nOur customers, and therefore our business and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions.\nA new surge in COVID-19 cases or the emergence of new variants could result in vaccine or testing requirements by governments in areas where we operate. Our implementation of these requirements may result in workforce attrition and difficulty meeting our existing or future hiring needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDemand for talent is highly competitive with additional pressures influenced by the pandemic. Our portfolio includes fixed-price and cost-plus contracts for which employment requirements are contract specific. In cost-plus contracts, we work with our customer to come to agreement with amendments for wage increases to meet the current demand and hiring needs. It is a challenge across the industry in how we estimate wage inflation rates and the impact of an ongoing pandemic as we submit proposals, particularly for fixed-price contracts. Our investments in technology and digital innovation have further enabled us to drive efficiency in our program delivery.\nThe competitive labor market requires that we continue to monitor and evaluate our related risks and opportunities. We continue to focus on human resources investments to position ourselves as an employer of choice and differentiate the company by leveraging flexibility, compensation and benefits, training and development, and other efforts.\nIn 2020 and 2021, we experienced procurement delays, including delays in procuring laptops and personal protective equipment, increased labor and technology costs, and reductions in outcome-based contract revenue. If these conditions recur as a result of new strains of COVID-19, it could have a material effect on our business, disrupt our ability to perform on contracts, cause delays, or limit the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us.\nWe cannot at this time predict the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting economic effects, but COVID-19 and unknown future pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face competition from a variety of organizations, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do; we may be unable to compete successfully with these organizations.\nWe face competition from a number of different organizations depending upon the market and geographic location in which we are competing. A summary of our most significant competitors is included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMany of these companies are international in scope, larger than us, and have greater financial resources, name recognition, and larger technical staffs. Substantial resources could enable certain competitors to initiate severe price cuts or take other measures in an effort to gain market share. In addition, we may be unable to compete for the limited number of large contracts because we may not be able to meet an RFP's requirement to obtain and post a large performance bond. Also, in some geographic areas, we face competition from smaller firms with established reputations and political relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our existing or any new competitors.\nFrom time to time, we engage subcontractors, teaming partners, or other third parties to provide our customers with a single-source solution. While we believe that we perform appropriate due diligence on our subcontractors and teaming partners, we cannot guarantee that those parties will comply with the terms set forth in their agreements or remain financially sound. We may have disputes with our subcontractors, teaming partners, or other third parties arising from the quality and timeliness of their work, customer concerns about them, or other matters. Subcontractor or teaming partner performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. We may be exposed to liability, and we and our clients may be adversely affected if a subcontractor or teaming partner fails to meet its contractual obligations.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Client Relationships\nWe obtain most of our business through competitive bidding in response to government RFPs. We may not be awarded contracts through this process at the same level in the future as in the past, and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable.\nSubstantially all of our customers are government agencies. To market our services to government customers, we are often required to respond to government RFPs, which may result in contract awards on a competitive basis. To do so effectively, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for providing the required services, the time required to establish operations, and likely terms of the proposals submitted by competitors. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within an RFP's rigid timetable. Our ability to respond successfully to RFPs will greatly impact our business. There is no assurance that we will continue to obtain contracts in response to government RFPs and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts. In addition, competitors may protest contracts awarded to us through the RFP process that may cause the award to be delayed, overturned, or require the customer to reinitiate the RFP process.\nEven where we are an incumbent, our ability to secure continued work or work at similar margins may be affected by competitive rebids or contract changes and cancellations. If we do not win certain recompetes, this may adversely affect our revenues and profitability, potentially resulting in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Although it is difficult to track all the reasons for changes in our contracts, we believe that this contract erosion has typically affected approximately 7% to 10% of our business annually, with the erosion largely being replaced by new or expanded work elsewhere. Our erosion rates were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as we received a significant volume of temporary work.\nOur business could be adversely affected by future legislative or government budgetary and spending changes.\nThe market for our services depends largely on domestic and international legislative programs and the budgetary capability to support programs, including the continuance of existing programs. Many of our contracts are not fully funded at inception and rely upon future appropriations of funds. Accordingly, a failure to receive additional anticipated funding may result in an early termination of a contract. In addition, many of our contracts include clauses that allow clients to unilaterally modify or terminate contracts with little or no recompense.\nChanges in state or federal government initiatives or in the level of government spending due to budgetary or deficit considerations may have a significant impact on our future financial performance. For example, regulatory steps taken under the ongoing PHE in the United States have affected the level of work on many of our contracts and the timing and nature of the termination of the PHE are uncertain.\nSimilarly, increased or changed spending on defense, security, or anti-terrorism threats may impact the level of demand or funding for the health and human services programs that we operate. Many state programs in the United States, such as Medicaid, are federally mandated and fully or partially funded by the U.S. Federal Government. Changes to those programs, such as program eligibility, benefits, or the level of federal funding, could reduce the level of demand for our services, which could materially adversely impact our future financial performance. For example, President Bidens executive order to forgive certain student loan indebtedness for qualified borrowers could adversely affect our student loan servicing business.\nGovernment entities have in the past terminated, and may in the future terminate their contracts with us earlier than we expect, which may result in revenue shortfalls and unrecovered costs.\nMany of our government contracts contain base periods of one or more years, as well as option periods covering more than half of the contract's potential duration. Government agencies do not have to exercise these option periods, and they may elect not to exercise them for budgetary, performance, or any other reason. Our contracts also typically contain provisions permitting a government customer to terminate the contract on short notice, with or without cause. Termination without cause provisions generally allow the government to terminate a contract at any time and enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses and profit, if any, on the work completed prior to termination. We may or may not be able to recover all the costs incurred during the startup phase of a terminated contract. The unexpected termination of significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot anticipate if, when, or to what extent a customer might terminate their contracts with us.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with government entities and agencies, our ability to successfully bid under RFPs may be adversely affected.\nTo facilitate our ability to prepare bids in response to RFPs, we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an RFP. We also engage marketing consultants, including lobbyists, to establish and maintain relationships with elected officials and appointed members of government agencies. The effectiveness of these consultants may be reduced or eliminated if a significant political change occurs. In that circumstance, we may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees. Any failure to maintain positive relationships with government entities and agencies may adversely affect our ability to successfully bid in response to RFPs.\nOur customers may limit or prohibit the outsourcing of certain programs or may refuse to grant consents and/or waivers necessary to permit contractors, such as us, to perform certain elements of government programs.\nGovernments could limit or prohibit private contractors like us from operating or performing elements of certain programs. Within the U.S., state or local governments could be required to operate such programs with government employees as a condition of receiving federal funding. Moreover, under current law, in order to privatize certain functions of government programs, the U.S. federal government must grant a consent and/or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency. If the U.S. federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver, the state or local agency will be unable to outsource that function to a private entity, such as us. This situation could eliminate or reduce the value of an existing contract.\nWe rely on key contracts with state, local and federal governments for a significant portion of our revenue. A substantial reduction in those contracts would materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIn fiscal year 2022, approximately 47% of our total revenue was derived from the U.S. federal government and approximately 35% of our total revenue was derived from contracts with state and local government agencies. Any significant disruption or deterioration in our relationship with federal, state, and local governments and a corresponding reduction in these contracts would significantly reduce our revenue and could substantially harm our business.\nOur contracts typically run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so. When these contracts expire, they may be opened for bidding by competing bidders, and there is no guarantee that the contracts will be renewed or extended. Our clients may elect to open bidding processes up earlier than anticipated, resulting in increased competition prior to the anticipated end of contracts.\nOur reputation and relationships with our clients are key factors in maintaining our business. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. If our reputation is negatively affected, our clients may decrease or cease business with us. In addition, we are subject to various reviews, audits, and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts, as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit, or investigation could result in, among other things, cancellation of contracts; refunding of amounts that have been paid pursuant to contracts; imposition of fines, penalties, and other sanctions; loss of rights to participate on various programs; loss of licenses; lowered quality ratings; or changes to the way we do business. In addition, under government procurement regulations and practices, a negative determination from a government audit could result in a contractor being fined, debarred, and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or be awarded, new government contracts for a period of time.\nWithin our U.S. Federal business, our ability to participate in many competitive bids in response to government RFPs may be managed through Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (\"GWACs\") or the process by which agencies of the federal government purchase goods and services. Eligibility to remain on a GWAC changes over time. We may not be invited to bid, and therefore be unable to be awarded contracts through this process at the same level in the future as in the past if we do not maintain full eligibility requirements over time.\nA GWAC is a pre-competed, multiple-award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ\") contract that agencies can use to buy total IT solutions. All IDIQs, including GWACs, are regulated by the FAR, which sets forth rules and regulations that must be followed by federal agencies and providers of goods and services to the government in the procurement process. For instance, in 2018, Maximus Federal was named a recipient of the U.S. General Services Administration's (\"GSA\") Alliant 2 GWAC. Alliant 2 is an unrestricted, IDIQ, multi-vendor award with a contract ceiling of $50 billion. If we are unable to adapt to changing eligibility requirements for a specific GWAC, we would risk losing access to related contracts and awards.\nRisks related to our acquisitions\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating our operations with those of acquired businesses and realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy includes a program to identify and execute acquisitions to enable long-term, sustainable, organic growth by continuing to expand the business, enhance our clinical and digital capabilities, and extend into new market areas. Although we anticipate that acquisitions will create long-term shareholder value, this expectation is based on assumptions about our acquisitions and preliminary estimates of their performance, which may change materially. The benefits of acquisitions depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits, including business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our businesses. We may not achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or may never realize these benefits and the value of our common stock may be harmed. Integration of acquired businesses may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\nOur management might have its attention diverted from ongoing business concerns while trying to integrate these operations, and we could experience performance shortfalls within our existing or acquired businesses as a result of the devotion of management's attention to integration efforts.\nThe integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees, or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions, and could harm our financial performance.\nWe could encounter unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications, and other systems that could harm our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to successfully or timely integrate our operations with those of our acquisitions, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies, and other anticipated benefits, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn connection with the acquisitions, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges that could negatively affect our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough we conducted due diligence on our acquisitions, we cannot assure that this diligence will reveal all material issues that may be present, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through customary due diligence, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. We have also purchased representations and warranties insurance policies in connection with certain acquisitions, but there is no assurance that those policies will cover any losses we might experience from breaches of the sellers' representations and warranties or otherwise arising from the acquisitions. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. We are required to identify the fair value of assets acquired, such as customer relationships and technology, using estimates which are based upon factors such as expected future operations and the manner in which we will utilize these assets, which may be inaccurate or may change post-acquisition. We may be required to take write-offs or write-downs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges that could negatively affect business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Pertaining to Legal Compliance and Data Security\nWe are subject to review and audit by governments at their sole discretion and, if any improprieties are found, we may be required to refund revenue we have received or forego anticipated revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and our ability to bid in response to RFPs.\nWe are subject to audits, investigations, and reviews relating to compliance with the laws and regulations that govern our role as a contractor to agencies and departments of the U.S. federal government, state, local, and foreign governments, and otherwise in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. Adverse findings could lead to criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings, and we could be faced with penalties, fines, suspension, or debarment. Adverse findings could also have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts. We are subject to periodic audits by U.S., federal, state, local, and foreign governments for taxes. We are also involved in various claims, arbitrations, and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business, including but not limited to bid protests, employment matters, contractual disputes, and charges before administrative agencies. Although we can give no assurance, based upon our evaluation and taking into account the advice of legal counsel, we do not believe that the outcome of any existing matter would likely have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, and other sanctions if we fail to comply with laws governing our business.\nOur business lines operate within a variety of complex regulatory schemes, including but not limited to the FAR, Federal Cost Accounting Standards, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (and similar national, state, and foreign laws), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, as well as the regulations governing Medicaid and Medicare and accounting standards. If a government audit finds improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government. Any adverse determination could adversely impact our ability to bid in response to RFPs in one or more jurisdictions. Further, as a government contractor subject to the types of regulatory schemes described above, we are subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits, and other legal actions and liabilities to which other private sector companies are not, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nAdverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes could harm our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to a variety of lawsuits and other claims. These may include lawsuits and claims related to contracts, subcontracts, securities compliance, employment and wage claims, and compliance with Medicaid and Medicare regulations, as well as laws governing student loans and child support enforcement. Adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief. In addition, litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties, and management's view of these matters may change in the future. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, costs of litigation, unpredictable court or jury decisions, and the differing laws and attitudes regarding damage awards among the states and countries in which we operate.\nOur systems and networks may be subject to cybersecurity breaches.\nWe are a trusted provider to government and other clients of critical health and human services that rely heavily upon technology systems, software, and networks to receive, input, maintain, and communicate participant and client data. The risk of a security breach, system disruption, ransom-ware attack, or similar cyber-attack or intrusion, including by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, or foreign governments, is persistent and substantial as the volume, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks, intrusions and threats from around the world increase daily. If our systems or networks were compromised, we could be adversely affected by losing confidential or protected information of program participants and clients or by facing a demand for ransom to restore access to such information. The loss, theft, or improper disclosure of that information could subject us to sanctions under the relevant laws, breach of contract claims, contract termination, class action, or individual lawsuits from affected parties, negative press articles, reputational damage, and a loss of confidence from our government clients, all of which could adversely affect our existing business, future opportunities, and financial condition.\nSimilarly, if our internal networks were compromised, we could suffer the loss of proprietary, trade secret, or confidential technical and financial data. That could make us less competitive in the marketplace and adversely affect our existing business, future opportunities, and financial condition.\nMany of our projects handle protected health information or other forms of confidential personal information, the loss or disclosure of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and reputation.\nAs a provider of services under government health and human services programs, we often receive, maintain, and transmit protected health information or other types of confidential personal information. That information may be regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\"HITECH\"), Internal Revenue Service regulations, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), or similar U.S. or foreign laws. The loss, theft, or improper use or disclosure of that information could subject us to sanctions under the relevant laws, breach of contract claims, class action or individual lawsuits from affected parties, negative press articles, and a loss of confidence from our government clients, all of which could adversely affect our existing business, future opportunities, and financial condition.\nWe may be precluded from bidding and performing certain work due to other work we currently perform.\nVarious laws and regulations prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies that might be viewed as an actual or apparent conflict of interest. These laws limit our ability to pursue and perform certain types of work. For example, some of our businesses assist government agencies in developing RFPs for various government programs. In those situations, the divisions involved in operating such programs would likely be precluded from bidding on those RFPs. Similarly, regulations governing the independence of Medicaid enrollment brokers and Medicare appeal providers prevent us from providing services to other organizations such as health plans and providers.\nWe may face liabilities arising from divested or discontinued businesses.\nWe have divested a number of businesses. The transaction documents for those divestitures typically contain a variety of representations, warranties, and indemnification obligations. We could face indemnification claims and liabilities from alleged breaches of representations or warranties.\nDuring 2009, we exited the revenue maximization business. Although we no longer provide those services, former projects that we performed for state clients remain subject to federal audits. Our contracts for that business generally provide that we will refund the portion of our fee associated with any federal disallowance. Accordingly, we may be obligated to refund amounts paid for such revenue maximization services depending on the outcome of federal audits.\nRisks Pertaining to our Human Resources\nWe may lose executive officers and senior managers on whom we rely to generate business and execute projects successfully.\nThe ability of our executive officers and our senior managers to generate business and execute projects effectively is important to our success. The loss of an executive officer or senior manager, including executives or managers who have joined us through acquisitions, could impair our ability to secure and manage engagements, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to sustain our business.\nOur delivery of services is labor-intensive. When we are awarded a government contract, we must quickly hire project leaders and operational staff. Some larger projects have required us to hire and train thousands of operational staff in a short time period. That effort can be especially challenging in geographic areas with low unemployment rates. The additional operational staff also creates a concurrent demand for increased administrative personnel. Our success requires that we attract, develop, motivate, and retain:\nexperienced and innovative executive officers globally;\nsenior managers who have successfully managed or designed government services programs; and\ninformation technology professionals who have designed or implemented complex information technology projects within and outside the U.S.\nInnovative, experienced, and technically proficient individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain desirable executive officers, senior managers, and management personnel. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of executive officers and senior managers could adversely affect our business.\nGovernment unions may oppose outsourcing of government programs to outside vendors such as us, which could limit our market opportunities and could impact us adversely. In addition, our unionized workers outside the United States could disrupt our operations, and our non-unionized workers could attempt to unionize which could disrupt our operations and impose higher costs on us.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to win profitable contracts to administer and manage health and human services programs traditionally administered by government employees. Many government employees, however, belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks. Unions have in the past applied, and are likely to continue to apply, political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to outsource government programs. Union opposition to these programs may result in fewer opportunities for us to service government agencies, prolonged and more complex procurement cycles, and the potential for adverse media coverage as the unions seek to discredit Maximus through their network of NewsGuild journalists who belong to the Communications Workers of America (\"CWA\") union.\nWe do operate outsourcing programs using unionized employees in Canada and the U.K. We have historically experienced opposition from the union in Canada, which does not favor the outsourcing of government programs. Adverse press coverage and union opposition may have a negative effect on the willingness of government agencies to outsource such projects, as well as certain contracts that are operated within a unionized environment. Our unionized workers could also declare a strike that could adversely affect our performance and financial results.\nNon-unionized workers could initiate organizing efforts to unionize at one or more of our locations. Such organizing efforts could be disruptive to our business operations and result in adverse publicity. A successful union organizing effort could substantially increase our personnel costs.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA number of factors may cause our cash flows and results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter.\nFactors that may cause our cash flows and results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter include:\nthe terms and progress of contracts;\ncaseloads and other factors where revenue is derived on transactional volume on contracts;\nthe levels of revenue earned and profitability of fixed-price and performance-based contracts;\nexpenses related to certain contracts which may be incurred in periods prior to revenue being recognized;\nincreasing rates of inflation which may increase our costs of labor and other goods and services;\nthe commencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\nthe schedules of government agencies for awarding contracts;\ngovernment budgetary delays or shortfalls;\nthe timing of change orders being signed;\nthe terms of awarded contracts; and\npotential acquisitions.\nChanges in the volume of activity and the number of contracts commenced, completed, or terminated during any quarter may cause significant variations in our cash flows and results of operations because a large amount of our expenses are fixed.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAt September 30, 2022, we owed $1.4 billion under our credit facilities. At September 30, 2022, our effective interest rate was 4.69%, compared to 2.05% at September 30, 2021. Our credit facilities are subject to variable rates that expose us to interest rate risk. When interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same.\nOur indebtedness contains financial or other covenants that limit our operational flexibility in a number of other ways, including:\ncausing us to be less able to take advantage of business opportunities, such as other acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\naffecting our ability to pay or refinance debts as they become due during adverse economic, financial market, and industry conditions;\nrequiring us to use a larger portion of cash flow for debt service, reducing funds available for other purposes;\ndecreasing our profitability and/or cash flow;\ncausing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage; and\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes.\nFurther, we anticipate amending our credit facilities to switch the benchmark rate from the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) during fiscal year 2023 as LIBOR is phased out. SOFR is a relatively new reference rate, has a very limited history and is based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. Changes in SOFR can be volatile and difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform similarly to the way LIBOR would have performed at any time. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our credit facilities is difficult to predict.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, 16% of our revenue was driven from jurisdictions outside the U.S. As a result, a significant portion of our business operations are subject to foreign financial, tax, and business risks which could arise in the event of:\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\nunexpected increases in tax rates or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws;\nnon-compliance with international laws and regulations, such as data privacy, employment regulations, and trade barriers;\nnon-compliance with U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies in international locations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\nlocal restrictions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic that could disrupt our business operations;\nthe absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights;\nnew regulatory requirements or changes in local laws that materially affect the demand for our services or directly affect our foreign operations;\nlocal economic and political conditions, including severe or protracted recessions in foreign economies and inflation risk;\nthe length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\ndifficulty managing and communicating with teams outside the U.S.;\nunusual or unexpected monetary exchange controls, price controls, or restrictions on transfers of cash; or\ncivil disturbance, terrorism, or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity in other parts of the world.\nThese factors may lead to decreased revenues and profits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInaccurate, misleading, or negative media coverage could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to bid for government contracts.\nBecause of the public nature of many of our business lines, the media frequently focuses their attention on our contracts with government agencies. If the media coverage is negative, it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services, which could reduce the number of RFPs. The media also focus their attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by us, and we may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities, even when those activities are unrelated to our business. Moreover, inaccurate, misleading, or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and, accordingly, our ability to bid for and win government contracts.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may have anti-takeover effects.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may delay, deter, or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider desirable. For example, our Articles of Incorporation provide that our shareholders may not take any action in writing without a meeting. This prohibition could impede or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by requiring that any corporate actions initiated by shareholders be adopted only at properly called shareholder meetings. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we sold the building in which our corporate headquarters was located. We lease offices for operations, management, and administrative functions in connection with the performance of our services.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company leased approximately 171 offices in the U.S. totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. In nine countries outside the U.S., the Company leased approximately 366 offices totaling approximately 0.9 million square feet. The lease terms vary from month-to-month to ten-year leases and are generally entered into at market rates. In the event that a property is used for our services in the U.S., we typically negotiate clauses to allow termination of the lease if the service contract is terminated by our customer. Such clauses are not standard in foreign leases.\nWe believe that our properties are maintained in good operating condition and are suitable and adequate for our purposes. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nRefer to our disclosures included in \"Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol \"MMS.\"\nAs of October 27, 2022, there were 37 holders of record of our outstanding common stock. The number of holders of record is not representative of the number of beneficial owners due to the fact that many shares are held by depositories, brokers, or nominees. We estimate there are approximately 114,807 beneficial owners of our common stock.\nDuring the first fiscal quarter of 2023, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share of Maximus stock. Our quarterly dividends during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $0.28 per share, respectively.\nWe intend to continue paying regular cash dividends, although there is no assurance as to future dividends. Future cash dividends, if any, will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our future operating results, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Activity During the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022\nPeriod Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of the Publicly Announced Plans (1) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans (in thousands)\nJuly 1, 2022 - July 31, 2022 353,848 $ 62.86 353,848 $ 50,588\nAugust 1, 2022 - August 31, 2022 - - - $ 50,588\nSeptember 1, 2022 - September 30, 2022 (2) 146,447 57.87 - $ 50,588\n500,295 $ 61.40 353,848\n(1)Under a resolution adopted in March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase, at management's discretion, of up to an aggregate of $200 million of our common stock.\n(2)The total number of shares purchased includes 146,447 restricted stock units which vested in September 2022, but which were utilized by the recipients to settle personal income tax obligations.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the five-year period from September 30, 2017, to September 30, 2022, with the cumulative total returns for the S&P MidCap 400 Index. In addition, we compared the results of a peer group to our performance. This new peer group is based upon the companies with similar revenue by end market. This peer group is comprised of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., CACI International Inc., Conduent, Inc., ICF International, Inc., Leidos, Inc., and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The old peer group was based upon companies listed within our proxy statement as entities whom we used as data points in establishing executive compensation. The old peer group is comprised of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp., CACI International Inc., Conduent, Inc., Gartner Inc., ICF International, Inc., Leidos, Inc., ManTech International Corp., Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Unisys Corp., Tetra Tech Inc., and KBR, Inc.\nThis graph assumes the investment of $100 on September 30, 2017, in our common stock, the S&P MidCap 400 Index, and our peer groups, weighted by market capitalization and assumes dividends are reinvested.\nNotes:\nThe lines represent index levels derived from compounded daily returns that include all dividends.\nThe indexes are reweighted daily, using the market capitalization on the previous trading day.\nIf the monthly interval, based on the fiscal year-end, is not a trading day, the preceding trading day is used.\nThe index level for all series was set to $100.00 on September 30, 2017. Item 6. Reserved Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe discussion below contains management's comments on our business strategy and outlook, and such discussions contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the expectations, beliefs, plans, and objectives of management about future financial performance and assumptions underlying management's judgment concerning the matters discussed, and accordingly, involve estimates, assumptions, judgments, and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements and the discussion below is not necessarily indicative of future results. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nBusiness Overview\nFor an overview of our business, including our business segments and discussion of the services we provide, see Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Overview\nA number of factors have affected our fiscal year 2022 results, the most significant of which we have listed below. More detail on these changes is presented below within our \"Results of Operations\" section.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we acquired VES Group, Inc. (\"VES\") and the Federal Division of Attain, LLC (\"Attain\"). We acquired Aidvantage at the beginning of fiscal year 2022. These acquisitions have been supplemented by several smaller acquisitions in fiscal years 2021 and 2022. In fiscal year 2022, we recognized a full year of revenue and operating costs from the 2021 acquisitions and Aidvantage, as well as intangible asset amortization. To fund the acquisition of VES, we entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase N.A. (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides both fixed-term debt and a new revolving credit facility. The cost of servicing this debt for a full year, as well as increasing interest rates, have resulted in an increase in our interest expense.\nIn both fiscal years 2021 and 2022, we received benefits from short-term work assisting governments with their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was often profitable and mitigated profit declines on established programs where transaction volume was reduced. The short-term work declined by approximately $800 million compared to fiscal year 2021, but the ongoing Public Health Emergency (\"PHE\") has meant many of our established U.S. programs continue to operate at reduced capacity. The timing and nature of the end of the PHE should have a favorable effect on our business. This could occur in fiscal year 2023.\nWithin our Outside the U.S. Segment, we recorded charges totaling $16.8 million on a single contract, anticipating a loss of the remaining life of the arrangement. If our current forecast remains unchanged, this project is forecasted to record a breakeven profit over its remaining life.\nOur Outside the U.S. Segment has benefited from the U.K. Restart contract, which commenced in late-fiscal year 2021. This growing contract has offset declines within the same segment from the contraction of our Australian business.\nDuring the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we completed the sale of our former headquarters building. This resulted in a gain of $11.0 million and a cash inflow of $16.4 million.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, information derived from our statements of operations. In preparing our discussion and analysis of these results, we focused on the comparison between fiscal years 2022 and 2021. A discussion comparing our results between fiscal years 2021 and 2020 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 18, 2021.\nTable MD&A 1: Consolidated Results of Operations\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenue $ 4,631,018 $ 4,254,485\nCost of revenue 3,691,208 3,307,510\nGross profit 939,810 946,975\nGross profit percentage 20.3 % 22.3 %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 534,493 494,088\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 11.5 % 11.6 %\nAmortization of intangible assets 90,465 44,357\nGain on sale of land and building 11,046 -\nOperating income 325,898 408,530\nOperating margin 7.0 % 9.6 %\nInterest expense 45,965 14,744\nOther expense, net 2,835 10,105\nIncome before income taxes 277,098 383,681\nProvision for income taxes 73,270 92,481\nEffective tax rate 26.4 % 24.1 %\nNet income $ 203,828 $ 291,200\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 3.30 $ 4.69\nDiluted $ 3.29 $ 4.67\nOur business segments have different factors driving revenue fluctuations and profitability. The sections that follow cover these segments in greater detail. Our revenue reflects fees earned for services provided. Cost of revenue consists of direct costs related to labor and related overhead, subcontractor labor, outside vendors, rent, and other direct costs. The largest component of cost of revenue, approximately two-thirds, is labor, including subcontracted labor.\nTable MD&A 2: Changes in Revenue, Cost of Revenue, and Gross Profit for the Year Ended September 30, 2022\nRevenue Cost of Revenue Gross Profit\nDollars % Change Dollars % Change Dollars % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nFiscal year 2021 $ 4,254,485 $ 3,307,510 $ 946,975\nOrganic effect (249,058) (5.9) % (65,687) (2.0) % (183,371) (19.4) %\nAcquired growth 667,384 15.7 % 484,552 14.7 % 182,832 19.3 %\nCurrency effect compared to the prior period (41,793) (1.0) % (35,167) (1.1) % (6,626) (0.7) %\nFiscal year 2022 $ 4,631,018 8.9 % $ 3,691,208 11.6 % $ 939,810 (0.8) %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") consist of indirect costs related to general management, marketing, and administration. It is primarily composed of labor costs. These costs may be incurred at a segment level, for dedicated resources that are not client-facing, or at a corporate level. Corporate costs are allocated to segments on a consistent and rational basis. Fluctuations in our SG&A are primarily driven by changes in our administrative cost base, which is not directly driven by changes in our revenue. As part of our work for the U.S. federal government and many states, we allocate these costs using a methodology driven by the U.S. Federal Cost Accounting Standards.\nOur SG&A expense has increased year-over-year due primarily to the increased cost base from our acquisitions. Our SG&A for fiscal year 2021 includes $9.5 million of acquisition expenses, primarily related to the VES and Attain transactions. In fiscal year 2022, we had a lower level of acquisition activity. We have also recorded a net benefit of $3.4 million from a reduction in contingent considerations due to the sellers of our acquired businesses.\nOur amortization of intangible assets increased by $46.1 million from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2022. This is the result of acquisitions in both fiscal years, partially offset by amortization related to the Census Questionnaire Assistance contract, which was acquired in November 2018 and fully amortized through November 2020.\nTable MD&A 3: Changes in Amortization of Intangible Assets Expense for The Year Ended September 30, 2022\nDollars % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nYear Ending September 30, 2021 $ 44,357\nVES acquisition 36,889 83.2 %\nAttain acquisition 4,375 9.9 %\nAidvantage acquisition 7,432 16.8 %\nOther 2022 acquisitions 735 1.7 %\nCQA contract (2,313) (5.2) %\nOther, including foreign exchange (1,010) (2.3) %\nYear Ending September 30, 2022 $ 90,465 $ 90,465\nOur intangible amortization expense is based upon assumptions of the value and economic life of assets acquired, typically established at the acquisition date. If these assumptions change, the pattern of future expense may be affected. The table below shows our results excluding the effects of intangible asset amortization.\nTable MD&A 4: Non-GAAP Adjusted Results Excluding Amortization of Intangible Assets\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nOperating income $ 325,898 $ 408,530\nAdd back: Amortization of intangible assets 90,465 44,357\nAdjusted operating income excluding amortization of intangible assets (Non-GAAP) $ 416,363 $ 452,887\nAdjusted operating income margin excluding amortization of intangible assets (Non-GAAP) 9.0 % 10.6 %\nNet income $ 203,828 $ 291,200\nAdd back: Amortization of intangible assets, net of tax 66,786 32,752\nAdjusted net income excluding amortization of intangible assets (Non-GAAP) $ 270,614 $ 323,952\nDiluted earnings per share $ 3.29 $ 4.67\nAdd back: Effect of amortization of intangible assets on diluted earnings per share 1.08 0.52\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share excluding amortization of intangible assets (Non-GAAP) $ 4.37 $ 5.19\nOur interest expense increased from $14.7 million in fiscal year 2021 to $46.0 million in fiscal year 2022. This increase is driven by the costs of our cash borrowings utilized to acquire VES. As stated in Note 8 - Debt and Derivatives, our interest rate will vary based upon both prevailing interest rates and our leverage ratio. Additional details on our borrowings are included within the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section.\nOur other income and expense relates to miscellaneous expenses which do not relate to our ongoing operating or financing needs. In fiscal year 2021, we incurred $8.5 million related to interim financing for the VES acquisition. This financing was not used and the cost was expensed. Expenses related to the current credit facilities have been deferred and are being recognized over the life of the agreement.\nOur effective income tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, was 26.4 % and 24.1 %, respectively. The increase in effective tax rate was mainly due to the decreased value of our restricted stock units at vesting compared to the value expensed. For fiscal year 2023, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 24.5% and 25.5%.\nU.S. Federal Services Segment\nOur U.S. Federal Services Segment delivers end-to-end solutions that help various U.S. federal government agencies better deliver on their mission, including program operations and management, clinical services, and technology solutions. This also includes appeals and assessments services, system and application development, IT modernization, and maintenance services. The segment also contains certain state-based assessments and appeals work that is part of the segment's heritage within the Medicare Appeals portfolio which continues to be managed within this segment. Benefited by the Maximus Attain platform, the segment executes on its digital strategy to deliver technology solutions that advance agency missions, including the challenge to modernize, provide better customer experience, and drive process efficiencies. The segment continues to expand its clinical solutions and manages the clinical evaluation process for U.S. veterans and service members on behalf of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The segment further supports clinical offerings in public health with new work supporting the U.S. Federal Government's COVID-19 response efforts. This included expanded work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") for their helpline and increased support for the IRS Wage and Investment Division's response efforts to general inquiries regarding the Coronavirus Aid Relief & Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and Economic Impact Payment Service Plan.\nTable MD&A 5: U.S. Federal Services Segment - Financial Results\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue $ 2,259,744 $ 1,893,284\nCost of revenue 1,740,304 1,460,733\nGross profit 519,440 432,551\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 284,509 243,485\nOperating income 234,931 189,066\nGross profit percentage 23.0 % 22.8 %\nOperating margin percentage 10.4 % 10.0 %\nTable MD&A 6: U.S. Federal Services Segment - Changes in Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue Cost of Revenue Gross Profit\nAmount % Change Amount % Change Amount % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance for fiscal year 2021 $ 1,893,284 $ 1,460,733 $ 432,551\nOrganic effect (274,569) (14.5) % (188,911) (12.9) % (85,658) (19.8) %\nAcquired growth 641,029 33.9 % 468,482 32.1 % 172,547 39.9 %\nBalance for fiscal year 2022 $ 2,259,744 19.4 % $ 1,740,304 19.1 % $ 519,440 20.1 %\nOur U.S. Federal Services Segment increased in size significantly in fiscal year 2022.\nWe received a full year of benefit from the acquisitions of VES (May 2021), Attain (March 2021), and Aidvantage (October 2021). The VES and Attain work is also more profitable than our legacy business.\nFiscal year 2021 included a significant amount of short-term, profitable work related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of this work ceased in late 2021 or early 2022. In addition, fiscal year 2021 includes approximately $67 million of non-recurring revenue related to the CQA contract, which ended in that year. Our organic profit margins have been tempered as we accepted a lower return on an existing contract in exchange for increased funding and anticipated future revenues.\nWe anticipate that our U.S. Federal Services business will continue to grow in fiscal year 2023, driven primarily by additional volumes anticipated in the VES business. We anticipate operating margins will range between 10% and 11%.\nU.S. Services Segment\nOur U.S. Services Segment provides a variety of business process services (\"BPS\"), such as program administration, appeals and assessments, and related consulting work for U.S. state and local government programs. These services support a variety of programs, including the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\"), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (\"TANF\"), and child support programs. As part of the governments' COVID-19 response efforts, the segment supported contact tracing, disease investigation, and vaccine distribution support services during the peak of the pandemic. The segment also successfully expanded into the unemployment insurance market where longer term opportunities have materialized. As part of the broader strategy to evolve clinically and address societal macro trends such as aging populations and rising costs, the segment continues to expand its offerings in public health with new work in in-person assessments.\nTable MD&A 7: U.S. Services Segment - Financial Results\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue $ 1,607,612 $ 1,662,110\nCost of revenue 1,264,608 1,254,060\nGross profit 343,004 408,050\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 160,902 153,609\nOperating income 182,102 254,441\nGross profit percentage 21.3 % 24.6 %\nOperating margin percentage 11.3 % 15.3 %\nOur revenue and cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022, decreased 3.3% and 0.8%, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2021. All movement was organic.\nAs anticipated, our revenue and profit margins have declined in fiscal year 2022 as short-term, COVID-19 related work, which typically earn higher margins, has slowed but many of our core programs which rely upon transactions are still running at low volumes due to the ongoing PHE. Our results in fiscal year 2021 include a write-down of approximately $12 million of assets related to a contract in the start-up phase.\nThe timing and nature of the end of the PHE, which could occur in fiscal year 2023, will have a significant effect on our results in fiscal year 2023. Assuming that the PHE does not end, we anticipate operating margins between 8% and 10% in 2023.\nOutside the U.S. Segment\nOur Outside the U.S. Segment provides BPS for international governments and commercial clients, transforming the lives of people around the world. Helping people find employment, access vital support, and remain healthy, these services include health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other job seeker related services. We support programs and deliver services in the U.K., including the Health Assessment Advisory Service (\"HAAS\") and Restart; Australia, including Workforce Australia (formerly jobactive) and the Disability Employment Service; Canada, including Health Insurance British Columbia and the Employment Program of British Columbia; in addition to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and UAE, where we predominantly provide employment support and job seeker services.\nTable MD&A 8: Outside the U.S. Segment - Financial Results\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue $ 763,662 $ 699,091\nCost of revenue 686,296 592,717\nGross profit 77,366 106,374\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 92,536 86,248\nOperating (loss)/income (15,170) 20,126\nGross profit percentage 10.1 % 15.2 %\nOperating margin percentage (2.0) % 2.9 %\nTable MD&A 9: Outside the U.S. Segment - Changes in Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue Cost of Revenue Gross Profit\nAmount % Change Amount % Change Amount % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance for fiscal year 2021 $ 699,091 $ 592,717 $ 106,374\nOrganic effect 80,009 11.4 % 112,676 19.0 % (32,667) (30.7) %\nAcquired growth 26,355 3.8 % 16,070 2.7 % 10,285 9.7 %\nCurrency effect compared to the prior period (41,793) (6.0) % (35,167) (5.9) % (6,626) (6.2) %\nBalance for fiscal year 2022 $ 763,662 9.2 % $ 686,296 15.8 % $ 77,366 (27.3) %\nThis segment experienced organic growth in revenue and costs, as well as acquired growth. This benefit was partially offset by significant declines in the value of international currencies against the United States Dollar.\nOrganic revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 reflects the benefit of our United Kingdom Restart contract, which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, partially offset by declines in our Australian business. The Australian business reported strong results in fiscal year 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic effect declined and opportunities reopened for work placements. Our fiscal year 2022 results initially returned to standard operating levels before a decline in the level of work following the third quarter. The detriment to our profit margin was primarily driven by the Australian business, where the reduction in revenues was not immediately matched with a decline in the cost base; in addition, some short-term severance costs were incurred. Profit margins were also tempered by charges totaling $16.8 million related to an implementation of a software product.\nAcquired growth is from Connect Assist Holdings Limited, acquired in September 2021; BZ Bodies Limited, acquired in January 2022; and Stirling Institute of Australia Pty Ltd, acquired in June 2022.\nMuch of our revenue growth stems from our employment services contracts, where we are paid based upon our ability to place individuals in long-term sustained employment. As a result, changes in our estimates of our ability to place people in work and the time that this will take can have significant effects on our revenue. These estimates are based upon our current expectations as to how the effects of the pandemic, including regulations adopted by governments and employment practices adopted by employers, will progress. Our estimates are based upon historical performance, where appropriate and available.\nWe anticipate our Outside the United States Segment will experience greater stability in fiscal year 2023, with less disruption from residual pandemic factors and underpinned by our core programs. We anticipate operating margins will be in the low single digits.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents estimated future revenue from:\nexisting signed contracts;\ncontracts that have been awarded but not yet signed; and\nunexercised priced contract options.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we estimate that we had approximately $19.8 billion in backlog.\nTable MD&A 10: Backlog by Segment\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in millions)\nU.S. Federal Services $ 13,168 $ 4,298\nU.S. Services 5,205 4,865\nOutside the U.S. 1,441 2,052\nBacklog $ 19,814 $ 11,215\nAt September 30, 2022, the average weighted remaining life of the contracts in our backlog was approximately 6.8 years, including option periods.\nIncreases in backlog result from the award of new contracts and the extension or renewal of existing contracts. Reductions in backlog come from fulfilling contracts or the early termination of contracts which our experience shows to be a rare occurrence. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report. The backlog associated with our performance-based contracts is an estimate based upon management's experience of caseloads and similar transaction volume, which is subject to revision based upon the latest information available. Additionally, backlog estimates may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe believe that comparisons of backlog period-to-period are difficult. We also believe that it is difficult to predict future revenue solely based on analysis of backlog. The actual timing of revenue from projects included in backlog will vary. We also may experience periods in which there is a greater concentration of rebids, resulting in a comparatively reduced backlog balance until subsequent award or extension on those contracts.\nThe longevity of these contracts assists management in predicting revenue, operating income, and cash flows for the purposes of business planning. We expect approximately 24% of the backlog balance to be realized as revenue in fiscal year 2022, which is 90% of the midpoint of fiscal year 2022 revenue guidance. Our standard forecasting process includes analyzing new work pipelines and submitted responses to requests for proposals (\"RFPs\") when predicting future revenue, operating income, and cash flows.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations, and availability under our revolving credit facilities. As of September 30, 2022, we had $40.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our current cash position, access to our revolvers, and cash flow generated from operations should be not only sufficient for our operating requirements but also to enable us to fund required long-term debt repayments, dividends and any share purchases we might choose to make. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our debt financing arrangements.\nTable MD&A 11: Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nOperating activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 289,839 $ 517,322\nNet cash used in investing activities (54,009) (1,835,480)\nNet cash (used in)/provided by financing activities (248,271) 1,385,693\nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (7,334) 474\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (19,775) $ 68,009\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $227.5 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. This decline was driven by a reduction in profits, the timing of payments from customers, and the timing of our payments to vendors.\nBoth years have received the benefit of faster cash collections. Our Days Sales Outstanding (\"DSO\") improved from September 30, 2020, when it was 77 days, through September 30, 2021 (68 days) and September 30, 2022 (62 days). Improved collections were driven by the recovery of payments delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of large payments at the end of fiscal year 2022.\nFiscal year 2021 received cash from up-front payments on contracts, notably in the United Kingdom, as new projects started. These cash flows did not recur to the same degree in fiscal year 2022.\nThe timing of both vendor and employee payments across both years also resulted in higher cash outflows from operations in fiscal year 2022. Increased interest payments on our debt, which we held for a full year in fiscal year 2022, were offset by reduced tax payments.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities\nInvesting activities for fiscal year 2022 include payments for current-year acquisitions and the settlement of the VES purchase price. This is offset by cash received from the sale of our former headquarters building, which was completed in August 2022. The prior year's cash flows include payments for the acquisitions of VES, Attain and Connect Assist.\nNet Cash (Used In)/Provided By Financing Activities\nThe principal drivers of financing cash flows are the Credit Agreement, our equity transactions and restricted cash flows where we hold funds on behalf of customers or vendors.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we received net cash flows of $1.47 billion, principally from borrowings and costs for the Credit Agreement. These funds were used to acquire VES. In fiscal year 2022, we have made net debt repayments of $155.7 million.\nIn addition to our dividend, we have purchased $96.1 million of Maximus common stock in fiscal year 2022, compared to $3.4 million in fiscal year 2021.\nOn certain contracts, we maintain funds within our treasury system which is owned by our client. We treat this cash as restricted cash and hold a corresponding liability on our balance sheet reflecting balances to be disbursed on behalf of our client. Although we do not own these funds, they are within our control and are considered financing cash flows. In fiscal year 2022, we received the benefit of the Receivables Purchase Agreement (\"RPA\") we entered into with Wells Fargo N.A., under which we can sell certain US-originated accounts receivable balances. Prior to September 30, 2022, we sold a customer invoice for $60.4 million. Although we sold these receivables, we maintained administrative responsibilities over cash collection. Having sold the invoice, the customer payment was received on September 30, 2022, resulting in excess cash flow. This cash receipt was treated as restricted cash and remitted to Wells Fargo in October 2022. We have recorded this transaction as \"other\" cash flows from financing activities.\nCash in Foreign Locations\nWe have no requirement to remit funds from our foreign locations to the United States. We will continue to explore opportunities to remit additional funds, taking into consideration the working capital requirements and relevant tax rules in each jurisdiction. When we are unable to remit funds back without incurring a penalty, we will consider these funds indefinitely reinvested until such time as these restrictions are changed. As a result, we do not record U.S. deferred income taxes on any funds held in foreign jurisdictions. We have not attempted to calculate our potential liability from any transfer of these funds, as any such transaction might include tax planning strategies that we have not fully explored. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the potential tax obligations if we were to remit all of our funds from foreign locations to the United States.\nFree Cash Flow\nTable MD&A 12: Free Cash Flow\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 289,839 $ 517,322\nPurchases of property and equipment and capitalized software (56,145) (36,565)\nFree cash flow $ 233,694 $ 480,757\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual Obligations\nCredit Facilities\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had total outstanding borrowing under our term loans and subsidiary loan agreements of $1.37 billion and $0.1 million, respectively. We had no outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement revolver as of September 30, 2022 and $600 million available. The Credit Agreement has annual repayment requirements and the balance must be repaid or refinanced at the termination of the agreements. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the terms of the Credit Agreement, including obligations by fiscal year.\nLeases\nAs of September 30, 2022, we reported current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $64.0 million and $86.2 million, respectively. These balances represent our contractual obligation to make future payments on our leases, discounted to reflect our cost of borrowing. The majority of these leases are for real estate. In the event that we vacate a location, we may be obliged to continue making lease payments. Where possible, we mitigate this risk by including clauses allowing for the termination of lease agreements if the contract the location covers is terminated by our customer. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our leases, including obligations by fiscal year.\nDeferred compensation plan\nAs of September 30, 2022, we reported liabilities of $43.1 million related to our deferred compensation plan. These balances are due to our employees based upon elections they make at the time of deferring their funds. The timing of these payments may change based upon factors, including termination of our employment arrangement with a participant. We maintain a rabbi trust to fund this liability.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We consider the accounting policies below to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because of the need to use significant judgment in recording the balance. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in \"Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nAlthough much of our revenue is recognized concurrently with billing or with the passage of time, some of our revenue requires us to make estimates. These estimates are reviewed quarterly, with any changes being recorded as a cumulative catch-up in revenue.\nSome of our performance-based contract revenue is recognized based upon future outcomes defined in each contract. This is the case in many of our employment services contracts in the Outside the U.S. Segment, where we are paid as individuals attain employment goals, which may take many months to achieve. We recognize revenue on these contracts over the period of performance. Our estimates vary from contract to contract but may include estimates of the number of participants reaching employment milestones and the service delivery period for participants reaching employment milestones. We are required to estimate these outcome fees ahead of their collection and recognize this estimated fee as revenue over the period of delivery. In almost all of the jurisdictions in which we operate, the employment markets have experienced significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic commenced, many employment opportunities were terminated. Our volume of new program participants is beginning to increase as governments shift their focus to addressing the residual impacts of the pandemic, such as the economy and unemployment, particularly in those countries where the pandemic has stabilized, and economies are beginning to reopen. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized revenue from these performance-based fees of $142.4 million. At September 30, 2022, we recorded $55.4 million of these estimated outcome fees as unbilled receivables which will be billed and then collected when we reach the targets we anticipate.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nOur balance sheet as of September 30, 2022, includes $1.78 billion of goodwill and $804.9 million of net intangible assets. These assets are created through business acquisitions and their creation and maintenance requires certain critical estimates.\nDuring an acquisition, we are required to estimate the fair value of all acquired tangible and intangible assets, as well as liabilities assumed, in order to allocate the purchase price. For many assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the calculation of fair value requires little judgment as balances may be readily convertible to cash receipts or cash payments or there may be an active market against which to measure value. For the valuation of intangible assets, significant judgment is necessary in identifying and valuing such assets. This valuation will also involve identifying the useful economic life of this asset. Our estimates of these fair values and useful economic lives are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable and, where appropriate, include assistance from third-party appraisal firms. The accounting for our acquisitions included determining the fair value of intangible assets representing customer relationships, the VES provider network and VES technology. In making our determination of the fair value of these assets, we utilized estimates, the most significant of which were forecasts related to future revenues and profit margins. These assumptions relate to the future performance of the acquired business, are forward-looking, and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The asset values and asset lives determined at acquisition may change based upon circumstances such as contract terminations or changes in strategy. When this occurs, we may need to accelerate our amortization charges. These assets are also subject to impairment if events indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For example, our intangible asset balance includes customer relationship assets which, if the customer relationship ends, would require evaluation of the remaining asset life and asset value.\nThe excess purchase price over the identified net assets is considered to be goodwill. Goodwill is recorded at the reporting unit level. The identification of our reporting units requires judgment based upon the manner in which our business is operated and the services performed. We believe our reporting units are consistent with our segments. Where we have acquisitions that provide services to more than one segment, or where the acquisition provides benefits across all of our segments, we use judgment to allocate the goodwill balance based upon the relative value we anticipate that each segment will realize.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. This process requires judgment in assessing the fair value of these reporting units. As of July 1, 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. In performing this assessment, we utilized a quantitative approach. In all cases, we determined that the fair value of our reporting units was significantly in excess of our carrying value to the extent that a 25% decline in fair value in any reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment charge.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, including contract and employment claims, in the ordinary course of business. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly. The amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments or changes in approach to a matter, such as a change in settlement strategy. We are also subject to audits by our government clients on many of our contracts based upon measures such as costs incurred or transactions processed. These audits may take place several years after a contract has been completed. We maintain reserves where we are able to estimate any potential liability that is updated as audits are completed.\nNon-GAAP and Other Measures\nWe utilize non-GAAP measures where we believe it will assist users of our financial statements in understanding our business. The presentation of these measures is meant to complement, but not replace, other financial measures in this document. The presentation of non-GAAP numbers is not meant to be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to revenue growth, cash flows from operating activities, net income, or earnings per share as measures of performance. These non-GAAP measures, as determined and presented by us, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nIn fiscal year 2022, 16% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. We believe that users of our financial statements wish to understand the performance of our foreign operations using a methodology that excludes the effect of year-over-year exchange rate fluctuations. To calculate year-over-year currency movement, we determine the current fiscal year's results for all foreign businesses using the exchange rates in the prior fiscal year.\nIn recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions. We believe users of our financial statements wish to evaluate the performance of our operations, excluding changes that have arisen due to businesses acquired or disposed of. We identify acquired revenue and cost of revenue by showing these results for periods for which no comparative results exist within our financial statements. We identify revenue and cost of revenue that has been disposed of in a similar manner. This information is supplemented by our calculations of organic growth. To calculate organic growth, we compare current fiscal year results excluding transactions from acquisitions or disposals, to our prior fiscal year results.\nOur recent acquisitions have resulted in significant intangible assets which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We believe users of our financial statements wish to understand the performance of the business by using a methodology that excludes the amortization of our intangible assets. Accordingly, we have calculated our operating profit, net income, and earnings per share, excluding the effect of the amortization of intangible assets. We have included a table showing our reconciliation of these income measures to their corresponding GAAP measures.\nIn order to sustain our cash flows from operations, we regularly refresh our fixed assets and technology. We believe that users of our financial statements wish to understand the cash flows that directly correspond with our operations and the investments we must make in those operations using a methodology that combines operating cash flows and capital expenditures. We provide free cash flow to complement our statement of cash flows. Free cash flow shows the effects of our operations and replacement capital expenditures and excludes the cash flow effects of acquisitions, purchases of our common stock, dividend payments, and other financing transactions. We have provided a reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nTo sustain our operations, our principal source of financing comes from receiving payments from our customers. We believe that users of our financial statements wish to evaluate our efficiency in converting revenue into cash receipts. Accordingly, we provide DSO, which we calculate by dividing billed and unbilled receivable balances at the end of each quarter by revenue per day for the period. Revenue per day for a quarter is determined by dividing total revenue by 91 days. Where our DSO is affected by acquisitions, such as the Connect Assist acquisition in September 2021, we will perform the DSO calculation on a pro forma basis, including the acquired revenue for the fiscal quarter.\nOur Credit Agreement includes the defined term Consolidated EBITDA and our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA conforms to the Credit Agreement. We believe our investors appreciate the opportunity to understand the possible restrictions which arise from our Credit Agreement.\nAdjusted EBITDA is also a useful measure of performance that focuses on the cash generating capacity of the business as it excludes the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, and makes for easier comparisons between the operating performance of companies with different capital structures by excluding interest expense and therefore, the impacts of financing costs.\nThe measure of Adjusted EBITA is a step in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and facilitates comparisons to similar businesses as it isolates the amortization effect of business combinations.\nThe Credit Agreement requires us to calculate Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis, as though we had owned any significant acquired business for a full twelve months. Accordingly, we have included the effects of VES and Attain in the table below. The Credit Agreement also requires us to adjust for unusual, non-recurring expenses, certain non-cash adjustments and estimated synergies from acquisitions.\nWe have provided a reconciliation from net income to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, and Non-GAAP Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as shown below.\nTable MD&A 13: Reconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITA, Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, and Non-GAAP Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet income $ 203,828 $ 291,200\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense 45,965 14,744\nOther expense 2,835 10,105\nProvision for income taxes 73,270 92,481\nAmortization of intangibles 90,465 44,357\nStock compensation expense 30,476 28,554\nAcquisition-related expenses 332 10,820\nGain on sale of land and building (11,046) -\nAdjusted EBITA - Non-GAAP measure 436,125 492,261\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment, and capitalized software 42,330 46,361\nAdjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP measure 478,455 $ 538,622\nPro forma and other adjustments permitted by our credit agreement - Non-GAAP measure 30,032 92,398\nPro forma adjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP measure $ 508,487 $ 631,020 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and counterparty risk.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs of September 30, 2022, we held net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar of $156.6 million. Of this balance, we had net monetary assets of $61.3 million and cash and cash equivalents of $38.7 million. We consider monetary assets to be those which hold a fair value close to their book value and which represent a recent cash outflow or which will become a cash inflow or outflow within a short period of time. These assets and liabilities are typically cash, billed, billable, and unbilled accounts receivable, current prepaid expenses, operating lease right-of-use assets, accounts payable, accrued compensation, deferred revenue, lease liabilities, and debt.\nA hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement across currencies would have the following incremental effects on our comprehensive income and our cash flow statement.\nTable 7A.1: Exposure to Currency Risk\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nChange in comprehensive income attributable to Maximus $ 15,657 $ 18,900\nChange in net monetary assets $ 6,127 $ 6,900\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,867 $ 9,100\nWhere possible, we mitigate our foreign currency risks. Our operations typically incur costs and cash outflows in the same currency as their revenue. We identify surplus funds in foreign locations and place them in entities with the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur principal exposure to interest rates relates to our debt. At September 30, 2022, we owed a gross balance of $1.4 billion associated with debt in the United States and in foreign locations.\nOur U.S. debt, in the form of term loans and a revolving credit facility, pay interest based upon a fixed rate and a market rate. At September 2022, the market rate is based upon the London Interbank Offering Rate (\"LIBOR\"), which we anticipate switching to the Secured Overseas Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") during fiscal year 2023. A rise of interest rate levels would increase our interest expense, and a reduction in interest rates to the floor would decrease our interest expense. We mitigate this risk through an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $300.0 million related to one of the term loans. We based this sensitivity calculation on the LIBOR rate of 3.125% in accordance with the most recent measurement date specified in our credit agreement. A 100 basis point change in interest rates would have the following impact in annual earnings.\nTable 7A.2: Exposure to Interest Rate Risk\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\n100 basis point increase impact on earnings $ (10,633) $ (10,600)\n100 basis point decrease impact on earnings $ 10,633 $ 1,500\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we reduced our exposure to interest rate changes through an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200.0 million.\nCounterparty Risk\nWe are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instrument. Our counterparty has investment-grade credit ratings; accordingly, we anticipate that the counterparty will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. Our agreement outlines the conditions upon which we or the counterparty are required to post collateral. As of September 30, 2022, we had no collateral posted with our counterparty related to the derivatives. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Maximus, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Maximus, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 22, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts, and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue recognition - Measuring Variable Consideration in Certain Performance-based Revenue Contracts\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in certain performance-based contracts, the Company recognizes revenue based on outcomes defined in each contract. Revenue recognition for certain of these contracts involves estimation of variable consideration utilizing management's judgments about performance related to future outcomes. Significant changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. During the year ended September 30, 2022 approximately $142 million of revenue was recorded on contracts that included an estimate related to contract performance for future outcomes.\nAuditing the Company's measurement of variable consideration for these performance-based contracts requires judgment because the calculation involves estimates of future outcomes. This estimate reflects management's estimates of the number of participants reaching employment milestones and the service delivery period for participants reaching employment milestones.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to calculate variable consideration, including determining the underlying assumptions about the number of participants reaching employment milestones and the service delivery period for participants reaching employment milestones.\nTo test the variable consideration, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant judgments and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management's calculation of variable consideration. For example, we tested management's estimate of the number of participants reaching employment milestones by comparing the amounts estimated to historical results, inclusive of changes to the current period environment, and performing sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in variable consideration that could result from changes in the Company's significant assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1996.\nTysons, Virginia\nNovember 22, 2022\nMaximus, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue $ 4,631,018 $ 4,254,485 $ 3,461,537\nCost of revenue 3,691,208 3,307,510 2,750,535\nGross profit 939,810 946,975 711,002\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 534,493 494,088 387,090\nAmortization of intangible assets 90,465 44,357 35,634\nGain on sale of land and building 11,046 -

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes, include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(\"SEC\"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on September 30 and unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal year or fiscal are for fiscal years ended September 30. The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 and the Company's results of operations for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. At each reporting period end, we make estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts, the realizability of goodwill, and amounts related to income taxes, certain accrued liabilities, and contingencies and litigation.\nWe base our estimates upon past experience and expectations. Our results in recent fiscal years were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic related government actions, which provide less opportunity to use these periods to predict outcomes in a post-pandemic environment.\nOur balance sheet includes a number of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, capitalized software, operating lease right-of-use assets, deferred contract costs, and intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful economic lives but are subject to impairment if events indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nAs disclosed in \"Note 4. Revenue Recognition,\" revenue for some of our employment services contracts in the Outside the U.S. Segment are based upon achievement of future outcomes as defined in each contract. Specifically, we are paid as individuals attain employment goals, which may take many months to achieve. Revenue is recognized on these contracts over the period of performance. Employment markets worldwide suffered a significant shock due to COVID-19, which resulted in significant reductions in work performed and outcomes reached. Although we experienced some recovery in fiscal year 2022, this revenue remains volatile.\nAs disclosed in \"Note 4. Revenue Recognition,\" we operate a small number of construction type contracts where we recognize revenue based upon our estimated progress towards completion. Changes in this estimate may result in fluctuations to revenue. We are also required to anticipate losses on these contracts; where these contracts cover several years, this may result in estimated expenses being recorded in a manner inconsistent with revenue.\nAs disclosed in \"Note 6. Business Combinations,\" we acquired three businesses during fiscal year 2022. For assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we are required to identify and recognize these balances at their fair value as of the date of acquisition.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash represents funds that are held in our bank accounts but which are precluded from use for general business needs through contractual requirements. These requirements typically include serving as collateral bonds and letters of credit or where we hold funds on behalf of clients. At September 30, 2022, we received a payment from a customer for a receivable balance that we had previously sold to a third-party. This balance was passed to the third party in October 2022 but was held as restricted cash at year end. We report our restricted cash balances within \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets\" on our balance sheet.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue as, or when, we satisfy performance obligations under a contract. We account for a contract when the parties approved the contract and are committed to perform on it, the rights of each party and the payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods or services, to a customer. The transaction price of a contract must be allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nAlthough our services may have many components, these components are not necessarily distinct performance obligations as they may be interdependent on or interrelated to each other. Where our contracts contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each component. This method will vary from contract to contract. Where available, we utilize standalone selling prices of similar components. If this information is unavailable, we utilize a suitable metric to allocate selling price, such as costs incurred.\nIn most cases, we view our performance obligations as promises to transfer a series of distinct services to our customer that are substantially the same and which have the same pattern of service. We recognize revenue over the performance period as a customer receives the benefits of our services. This continuous transfer of control is supported by the unilateral right of many of our customers to terminate contracts for convenience, without having to provide justification for this decision. Where we are reimbursed on a cost-plus basis, we recognize revenue based upon our costs incurred to date; where we are reimbursed on a fixed price basis, we recognize revenue based upon an appropriate output measure that may be time elapsed or another measure within the contract. When we have variable fees, such as revenue related to the volume of work or award fees, we allocate that revenue to the distinct periods of service to which they relate. In estimating our variable fees, we are required to constrain our estimates to the extent that it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of cumulative revenue when the uncertainty is resolved.\nOther performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time, rather than over time. We recognize revenue only when the customer received control over the goods provided. Revenue recognition on these performance obligations does not require a significant level of judgment or estimation.\nWhere we have contract modifications, these are reviewed to determine whether they should be accounted for as part of the original performance obligation or as a separate contract. Where the modification changes the scope or price and the additional performance obligations are at their standalone selling price, these services are considered a separate contract. Where there is a modification, and the additional performance obligations are not at their standalone selling price, we consider whether those performance obligations are distinct from those already delivered. If services are distinct from those already provided, the contract is accounted for prospectively, as though the original contract had been terminated and a new arrangement entered into. Where the modification includes goods or services which are not distinct from those already provided, we record a cumulative adjustment to revenue based upon a remeasurement of progress towards the complete satisfaction of performance obligations not yet fully delivered.\nAccounts Receivable-Billed, Billable, and Unbilled and Deferred Revenue\nBilled receivables are balances where an invoice has been prepared and issued and is collectible under standard contract terms. Many of our clients require invoices to be prepared on a monthly basis. Where we anticipate that an invoice will be issued within a short period of time and where the funds are considered collectible within standard contract terms, we include this balance as billable accounts receivable.\nBoth billed and billable balances are recorded at their face amount less an allowance for credit losses over the contractual payment terms of the receivable. We periodically reassess these amounts by analyzing reasonably available information as of the balance sheet date, including the length of time that the receivable has been outstanding, historical bad debts and aging trends, and other general and contract-specific factors.\nWe present billed, billable, and unbilled receivables as one component on our consolidated balance sheets. Our deferred revenue is presented as a separate item on our consolidated balance sheet, broken out by current and long-term portion. Unbilled receivables and deferred revenue represent timing differences between when amounts are billed or billable and when revenue has been recognized or has occurred as of period end. The timing of these billings is generally driven by the contractual terms, which may have billing milestones that are different from revenue recognition milestones. Our unbilled receivables balance also includes retainage balances, where customers may hold back payment for work performed for a period of time to allow opportunities to evaluate the quality of our performance. The balance also includes estimated fees where performance outcomes are anticipated but have not yet been achieved. Our unbilled receivable balance is recorded at fair value - the value which we expect to invoice for the services performed once the objective criteria laid out by the contract have been met.\nWe defer revenue where we receive up-front funds to establish the infrastructure needed for a long-term contract.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk has not historically been significant to our business due to the nature of our customers. 47% of our revenue is from the U.S. federal government and much of our Outside the U.S. segment is from national governments. Many of our U.S. state government agency programs receive significant federal funding. We believe that the credit risk associated with our receivables is limited due to the creditworthiness of our customers.\nBusiness Combinations and Goodwill\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to tangible assets, separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. Any excess balance is recorded as goodwill. Costs incurred directly related to an acquisition, including legal, accounting, and valuation services, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed regularly by segment management. However, components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics. We have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If we conclude that such an impairment is not more-likely-than-not in all cases, no additional quantitative analysis is required. If such an impairment is more-likely-than-not, or if we choose to bypass this qualitative assessment, a quantitative evaluation is performed by comparing the fair value of the relevant reporting unit to the carrying value, including goodwill, of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined to be impaired.\nOur reporting units are consistent with our operating segments, U.S. Federal Services, U.S. Services, and Outside the U.S. We perform our annual impairment test as of July 1 of each year. We performed the annual impairment test using the quantitative assessment as of July 1, 2022, and concluded that the fair value of each of the reporting units were greater than the carrying amounts.\nIntangible Assets\nAll of our intangible assets are acquired through business combinations. They are separately identified and recorded at fair value upon acquisition.\nWe use judgment in identifying, valuing, and assigning a useful economic life to assets as they are acquired. The judgments required vary with the type of asset but may include projections of future results, estimated costs to recreate or replace assets, the cost of utilizing other, similar assets provided by a third party, and an appropriate cost of capital. Where appropriate, we utilize the services of a third-party specialist to assist us in these valuations. We amortize our intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. We believe this reflects the manner in which the value from our customer relationships, technology, and other assets is realized by the business.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded over the assets' respective useful economic lives using the straight-line method, which are not to exceed 39 years for our buildings and 7 years for office furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the remaining term of the lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized Software\nAll of our capitalized software represents development costs for software that is intended for our internal use. Direct costs of time and materials incurred for the development of application software for internal use are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging from three to eight years. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements that do not result in additional functionality are expensed as incurred.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs consist of contractually recoverable costs to fulfill related to long-term service contracts. These costs include direct and incremental costs incurred prior to the commencement of providing service to our customer. These costs are expensed over the period the services are provided using the straight-line method.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse. In addition, a valuation allowance is recorded if it is believed more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized.\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would \"more likely than not\" sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the \"more likely than not\" threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\nForeign Currency\nFor all foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in \"other expense/(income), net\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, including contract and employment claims. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies, as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly. The amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter, such as a change in settlement strategy.\nWe are also subject to audits by our government clients on many of our contracts based upon measures such as costs incurred or transactions processed. These audits may take place several years after a contract has been completed. We maintain reserves where we believe the loss is probable, and we are able to estimate any potential liability.\nFair Value Measurements\nU.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value, and requires certain disclosures relating to fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants.\nThe three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value is as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access;\nLevel 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted market prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions when there is little, if any, related market data available.\nWe evaluate assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring and non-recurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made. The fair values of receivables, prepaid assets, other assets, accounts payable, accrued costs, and other current liabilities approximate the carrying values as a result of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nWe hold investments in a Rabbi Trust on behalf of our deferred compensation plan. These assets are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value under the heading of \"Deferred compensation plan assets.\" These assets have quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). See \"Note 16. Employee Benefit Plans and Deferred Compensation\" for further details.\nWe use derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The valuation is calculated based on observable inputs (Level 2). See \"Note 8. Debt and Derivatives\" for further details.\nWe recorded contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions that may be paid in the future. The related liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at estimated fair value under the heading \"Other liabilities\" and updated on a quarterly basis as an acquisition-related expense or benefit. The valuation of this liability is derived from internal estimates of future performance and not from inputs that are observable (Level 3). See \"Note 6. Business Combinations\" for further details.\nLeases\nWe enter into contractual arrangements primarily for the use of real estate facilities, information technology equipment, and certain other equipment. These arrangements contain a lease when we control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Where contracts include both lease and non-lease components, we do not separate the non-lease components in our accounting. The majority of our leases are operating leases.\nAt the inception of a lease, we recognize a liability for future minimum lease payments based upon the present value of those payments.\nIn identifying our future minimum lease payments, we do not include variable lease costs, such as those for maintenance or utilities. These are recorded as lease expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\nIn identifying future lease payments, we do not include short-term leases, identified as those with an initial term of twelve months or less.\nLease options are included within our lease liability only where it is reasonably certain that we will utilize those periods of the lease and incur the related costs.\nIn calculating the fair value of our lease liability, we utilize an estimate of our collateralized incremental borrowing rate. This estimate is based upon publicly-available information adjusted for company, country, and lease-specific factors. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate utilized as of September 30, 2022 was 3.5%.\nOver the course of a lease, the lease liability is reduced as scheduled lease payments are made and increased as the implied interest charges are added.\nOur right-of-use asset is based upon the lease liability at the contract inception but is adjusted over the life of the lease by lease prepayments, additional costs, or lease incentives. The right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, offset by the interest accretion recorded on the lease liability.\nLease expense is recorded within our consolidated statements of operations based upon the nature of the assets. Where assets are used to directly serve our customers, such as facilities dedicated to customer contracts, lease costs are recorded in \"cost of revenue.\" Facilities and assets which serve management and support functions are expensed through \"selling, general, and administrative expenses.\"\nStock Compensation Plan\nWe grant both restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units (\"PSUs\") to eligible participants under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders.\nThe fair value of each RSU is equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of the grant, which is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The RSUs granted vest ratably over one to five years, in each case from the grant date. All individuals who are granted RSUs also receive dividend-equivalent payments in the form of additional RSUs. However, until the shares are issued, they have no voting rights and may not be bought or sold. In the event that an award is forfeited, the dividend-equivalent payments received by the holder with respect to that award are also forfeited. We estimate our stock award forfeitures as we expense each award.\nWe issue PSUs with targets based upon profit metrics. These PSUs vest in full at the end of a three-year period. The fair value of each award is based upon the market price of the common stock on the day of the grant and expense is recorded based upon our estimate of how much of the award will vest over the three years of the award.\nWe issue PSUs with a target based upon total shareholder return. These PSUs vest in full after three years. The fair value of each award is based upon an assessment performed at the grant date and is expensed over the life of the award regardless of whether the targets are reached.\nCertain executive awards include a retirement provision whereby such awards fully vest upon an employee's retirement. We recognize total compensation expense of the awards for eligible participants ratably over the shorter of the vesting period or the employees' retirement eligibility date.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company is using an interest rate swap contract to lock a portion of the variability of the interest payments on long-term debt. The Company elected to designate these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to earnings, through \"Interest expense\", when the underlying forecasted transaction affects earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company reassesses the effectiveness of the hedge on a quarterly basis.\n3. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nWe conduct our operations through three business segments: U.S. Federal Services, U.S. Services, and Outside the U.S.\nU.S. Federal Services\nOur U.S. Federal Services Segment delivers end-to-end solutions that help various U.S. Federal Government Agencies better deliver on their mission, including program operations and management, clinical services, and technology solutions. This also includes appeals and assessments services, system and application development, IT modernization, and maintenance services. The segment also contains certain state-based assessments and appeals work that is part of the segment's heritage within the Medicare Appeals portfolio which continues to be managed within this segment. Benefiting from the Maximus Federal Consulting (formerly Attain Federal) platform, the segment executes on its digital strategy to deliver technology solutions that advance agency missions, including the challenge to modernize, provide better customer experience, and drive process efficiencies. The segment continues to expand its clinical solutions with the acquisition of VES Group, Inc., which manages the clinical evaluation process for U.S. veterans and service members on behalf of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The segment further supports clinical offerings in public health with work supporting the U.S. federal government's COVID-19 response efforts. This included expanded work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") for their helpline and increased support for the IRS Wage and Investment Division's response efforts to general inquiries regarding the Coronavirus Aid Relief & Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and Economic Impact Payment Service Plan.\nU.S. Services\nOur U.S. Services Segment provides a variety of business process services (\"BPS\"), such as program administration, appeals and assessments, and related consulting work for U.S. state and local government programs. These services support a variety of programs, including the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\"), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (\"TANF\"), and child support programs. As part of the governments' COVID-19 response efforts, the segment supported contact tracing, disease investigation, and vaccine distribution support services during the peak of the pandemic. The segment also successfully expanded into the unemployment insurance market where longer term opportunities have materialized. As part of the broader strategy to evolve clinically and address societal macro trends such as aging populations and rising costs, the segment continues to expand its offerings in public health with new work in in-person assessments.\nOutside the U.S.\nOur Outside the U.S. Segment provides BPS for international governments and commercial clients, transforming the lives of people around the world. Helping people find employment, access vital support, and remain healthy, these services include health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other job seeker-related services. We support programs and deliver services in the U.K., including the Health Assessment Advisory Service (\"HAAS\") and Restart; Australia, including Workforce Australia and the Disability Employment Service; Canada, including Health Insurance British Columbia and the Employment Program of British Columbia; in addition to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and UAE where we predominantly provide employment support and job seeker services.\nTable 3.1: Results of Operation by Business Segment (1)\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nAmount % (2) Amount % (2) Amount % (2)\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue:\nU.S. Federal Services $ 2,259,744 $ 1,893,284 $ 1,633,337\nU.S. Services 1,607,612 1,662,110 1,329,274\nOutside the U.S. 763,662 699,091 498,926\nRevenue $ 4,631,018 $ 4,254,485 $ 3,461,537\nGross profit:\nU.S. Federal Services $ 519,440 23.0 % $ 432,551 22.8 % $ 318,925 19.5 %\nU.S. Services 343,004 21.3 % 408,050 24.6 % 360,272 27.1 %\nOutside the U.S. 77,366 10.1 % 106,374 15.2 % 31,805 6.4 %\nGross profit $ 939,810 20.3 % $ 946,975 22.3 % $ 711,002 20.5 %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses:\nU.S. Federal Services $ 284,509 12.6 % $ 243,485 12.9 % $ 186,023 11.4 %\nU.S. Services 160,902 10.0 % 153,609 9.2 % 132,489 10.0 %\nOutside the U.S. 92,536 12.1 % 86,248 12.3 % 65,938 13.2 %\nGain on sale of business (3) - NM - NM (1,718) NM\nOther (5) (3,454) NM 10,746 NM 4,358 NM\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses $ 534,493 11.5 % $ 494,088 11.6 % $ 387,090 11.2 %\nOperating income:\nU.S. Federal Services $ 234,931 10.4 % $ 189,066 10.0 % $ 132,902 8.1 %\nU.S. Services 182,102 11.3 % 254,441 15.3 % 227,783 17.1 %\nOutside the U.S. (15,170) (2.0) % 20,126 2.9 % (34,133) (6.8) %\nAmortization of intangible assets (90,465) NM (44,357) NM (35,634) NM\nGain on sale of business (3) - NM - NM 1,718 NM\nGain on sale of land and building (4) 11,046 NM - NM - NM\nOther (5) 3,454 NM (10,746) NM (4,358) NM\nOperating income $ 325,898 7.0 % $ 408,530 9.6 % $ 288,278 8.3 %\nDepreciation and amortization:\nU.S. Federal Services $ 12,332 0.5 % $ 12,986 0.7 % $ 25,153 1.5 %\nU.S. Services 16,528 1.0 % 20,350 1.2 % 20,951 1.6 %\nOutside the U.S. 13,470 1.8 % 13,025 1.9 % 18,423 3.7 %\nDepreciation and amortization $ 42,330 0.9 % $ 46,361 1.1 % $ 64,527 1.9 %\n(1)Expenses that are not specifically included in the segments are included in other categories, including amortization of intangible assets and the direct costs of acquisitions.

REVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe recognize revenue as, or when, we satisfy performance obligations under a contract. The majority of our contracts have performance obligations that are satisfied over time. In most cases, we view our performance obligations as promises to transfer a series of distinct services to our customers that are substantially the same and which have the same pattern of service. We recognize revenue over the performance period as a customer receives the benefits of our services.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn addition to our segment reporting, we disaggregate our revenues by service, contract type, customer type, and geography. Our operating segments represent the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer reviews our financial results, which is further discussed in \"Note 3. Business Segments.\"\nTable 4.1: Revenue by Service Type\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 % 2021 % 2020 %\n(dollars in thousands)\nProgram Operations $ 2,596,801 56.1 % $ 2,755,820 64.8 % $ 2,395,618 69.2 %\nClinical Services 1,176,081 25.4 % 699,424 16.4 % 539,018 15.6 %\nEmployment & Other 551,755 11.9 % 463,695 10.9 % 318,431 9.2 %\nTechnology Solutions 306,381 6.6 % 335,546 7.9 % 208,470 6.0 %\nTotal revenue $ 4,631,018 $ 4,254,485 $ 3,461,537\nDuring fiscal year 2022, management changed the manner in which the products and services across our segments are viewed. Accordingly, the business lines have been updated, and historical balances adjusted to reflect our updated view of the business.\nTable 4.2: Revenue by Contract Type\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 % 2021 % 2020 %\n(dollars in thousands)\nPerformance-based $ 2,091,608 45.2 % $ 1,416,562 33.3 % $ 1,109,153 32.1 %\nCost-plus 1,248,759 27.0 % 1,237,995 29.1 % 1,578,912 45.6 %\nFixed price 627,402 13.5 % 553,645 13.0 % 471,505 13.6 %\nTime and materials 663,249 14.3 % 1,046,283 24.6 % 301,967 8.7 %\nTotal revenue $ 4,631,018 $ 4,254,485 $ 3,461,537\nTable 4.3: Revenue by Customer Type\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 % 2021 % 2020 %\n(dollars in thousands)\nU.

We classify these assets as accounts receivable - billed and billable and unbilled receivables; the liabilities are classified as deferred revenue.\nIn many contracts, we bill our customers on a monthly basis shortly after the month end for work performed in that month and such balances are considered collectible and are included within accounts receivable, net.\nExceptions to this pattern will arise for various reasons, including those listed below.\nUnder cost-plus contracts, we are typically required to estimate a contract's share of our general and administrative expenses. This share is based upon estimates of total costs, which may vary over time. We typically invoice our customers at an agreed provisional billing rate which may differ from actual rates incurred. If our actual rates are higher than the provisional billing rates, an asset is recorded for this variance; if the provisional billing rates are higher than our actual rates, we record a liability.\nCertain contracts include retainage balances, whereby revenue is earned, but some portion of cash payments are held back by the customer for a period of time, typically to allow the customer to confirm the objective criteria laid out by the contract have been met. This balance is classified as accounts receivable - unbilled until restrictions on billing are lifted. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, $13.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively, of our unbilled receivables related to amounts pursuant to contractual retainage provisions.\nIn certain contracts, we may receive funds from our customers prior to performing operations. These funds are typically referred to as \"set-up costs\" and reflect the need for us to make investments in infrastructure prior to providing a service. This investment in infrastructure is not a performance obligation that is distinct from the service that is subsequently provided and, as a result, revenue is not recognized based upon the establishment of this infrastructure, but rather over the course of the contractual relationship. The funds are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the contract. Other contracts may not include set-up fees but will provide higher fees in earlier periods of the contract. The premium on these fees is deferred.\nSome of our contracts, notably our employment services contracts in the Outside the U.S. Segment, include payments for desired outcomes, such as job placement and job retention, and these outcome payments occur over several months. We are required to estimate these outcome fees ahead of their realization and recognize this estimated fee over the period of delivery.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized revenue of $103.2 million included in our deferred revenue balances at September 30, 2021. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we recognized revenue of $45.9 million included in our deferred revenue balances at September 30, 2020.\nContract estimates\nWe are required to use estimates in recognizing revenue from some of our contracts. As discussed in \"Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies,\" the calculation of these estimates has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced our ability to use past results to estimate future performance.\nSome of our performance-based contract revenue is recognized based upon future outcomes defined in each contract. This is the case in many of our employment services contracts in the Outside the U.S. Segment, where we are paid as individuals attain employment goals, which may take many months to achieve. We recognize revenue on these contracts over the period of performance. Our estimates vary from contract to contract but may include estimates of the number of participants reaching employment milestones and the service delivery periods for participants reaching employment milestones. We are required to estimate these outcome fees ahead of their collection and recognize this estimated fee over the period of delivery. In almost all of the jurisdictions in which we operate, the employment markets have experienced significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic commenced, many employment opportunities were terminated. Our volume of new program participants is beginning to increase as governments shift their focus to addressing the residual impacts of the pandemic, such as the economy and unemployment, particularly in those countries where the pandemic has stabilized, and economies are beginning to reopen. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue from these performance-based fees of $142.4 million and $104.7 million, respectively. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $55.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively, of these estimated outcome fees which will be collected only when we reach anticipated targets. This balance is included on our consolidated balance sheets within the related contract accounts.\nChanges to our estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we reported a reduction to revenue and diluted earnings per share of $2.5 million and $0.03, respectively, from changes in estimates. The corresponding change in fiscal year 2021 was a benefit in revenue and diluted earnings per share of $20.9 million and $0.24, respectively.\nRemaining performance obligations\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $425 million of remaining performance obligations. We anticipate that we will recognize revenue on approximately 60% of this balance within the next 12 months. This balance excludes contracts with an original duration of twelve months or less, including contracts with a penalty-free termination for convenience clause, and any variable consideration which is allocated entirely to future performance obligations, including variable transaction fees or fees tied directly to costs incurred.\n5. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nTable 5: Weighted Average Number of Shares - Earnings Per Share\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 61,774 62,072 63,062\nDilutive effect of unvested RSUs and PSUs 195 293 260\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share 61,969 62,365 63,322\nThe diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 excludes approximately 444,000, 55,000, and 215,000 unvested anti-dilutive restricted stock units, respectively.\n6. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nVES Group, Inc. (VES)\nOn May 28, 2021, we acquired 100% of VES for a purchase price of $1.37 billion (the \"VES Acquisition\"). VES was integrated into our U.S. Federal Services Segment. The VES Acquisition supports our ongoing strategic priority of expansion into the U.S. Federal market and accelerates our clinical evolution to meet long-term demand for BPS with a clinical dimension. We have completed our valuation of all acquired assets and liabilities assumed.\nTable 6.1: VES Valuation\nAllocation of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2021 Adjustments Allocation of Assets and Liabilities\n(in thousands)\nConsideration paid:\nCash consideration, net of cash acquired $ 1,364,866 $ 5,765 $ 1,370,631\nAssets acquired:\nAccounts receivable - billed, billable and unbilled $ 44,078 $ - $ 44,078\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 7,955 - 7,955\nProperty and equipment, net 9,113 (1,092) 8,021\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 18,898 - 18,898\nIntangible assets 664,000 - 664,000\nOther assets 7,166 - 7,166\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 751,210 (1,092) 750,118\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable and accrued compensation 42,182 1,804 43,986\nOperating lease liabilities 18,898 - 18,898\nIncome taxes payable, current 5,673 - 5,673\nDeferred income taxes 171,497 (474) 171,023\nOther long-term liabilities 12,270 - 12,270\nTotal identifiable liabilities assumed 250,520 1,330 251,850\nNet identifiable assets acquired 500,690 (2,422) 498,268\nGoodwill 864,176 8,187 872,363\nNet assets acquired $ 1,364,866 $ 5,765 $ 1,370,631\nGoodwill represents the value of the assembled workforce and the enhanced knowledge, capabilities, and qualifications held by the business. This goodwill balance is not deductible for tax purposes.\nOur evaluation of the intangible assets acquired with VES identified three assets. The assets were valued using methods that required a number of estimates and, accordingly, they are considered Level 3 measurements within the Accounting Standard Codification No. 820 (ASC 820) fair value methodology.\nCustomer relationships represent the value of the existing contractual relationships with the United States Federal Government. These were valued using the excess earnings method, which required us to utilize estimated future revenues and earnings from contracts and an appropriate rate of return.\nVES maintains a provider network of third-party providers that assist in the performance of their clinical services. This network was valued using the cost method and income approach, which included both the cost of recreating such a network and the profits foregone during the time which would be required to recreate the network and an appropriate rate of return.\nVES maintained proprietary technology which interacted with U.S. federal government systems, facilitated the transmission of examination data, and supported the performance of the contracts. We valued the technology using a relief-from-royalty method, which required us to estimate future revenues and an arm's length royalty rate that a third-party provider might use to supply this service and an appropriate rate of return.\nTable 6.2: VES Intangible Asset Values and Useful Lives\nEstimated Straight-Line Useful Life Estimated Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nCustomer contracts and relationships 12 years $ 580,000\nProvider network 12 years 57,000\nTechnology-based intangible assets 12 years 27,000\nTotal intangible assets $ 664,000\nIn connection with certain liabilities acquired in the VES acquisition, we established a liability of $12.0 million for a billing dispute between VES and its customer relating to prior year billings. Our exposure was partially offset by an indemnification asset of $6.0 million. During the fiscal year 2022, we paid the liability and recovered the indemnification asset.\nAt acquisition, we established a tax liability of $12.3 million for uncertain tax positions within VES, partially offset by another indemnification asset of $7.2 million. Since acquisition, we have resolved a number of uncertain tax positions and therefore at September 30, 2022, we retain an estimated indemnification asset of $2.9 million, backed up by an escrow account.\nThe Federal division of Attain, LLC (\"Attain\")\nOn March 1, 2021, we acquired 100% of Attain for a cash purchase price of $419.1 million. This business was integrated into our U.S. Federal Services Segment and is expected to strengthen our position to further design, develop, and deliver more innovative, impactful solutions and drive automation of processes to improve citizen engagement and the delivery of critical federal programs, as well as expand our presence in the U.S. Federal market. We utilized borrowings on the credit facility we had in place at the time, as well as cash on our balance sheet to fund the acquisition.\nTable 6.3: Attain Valuation\nAllocation of Assets and Liabilities\n(in thousands)\nConsideration paid:\nCash consideration paid, net of cash acquired $ 419,097\nAssets acquired:\nAccounts receivable - billed, billable and unbilled 39,375\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 926\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 24,960\nIntangible assets 105,000\nOther assets 74\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 170,335\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable and other liabilities 28,863\nOperating lease liabilities, less current portion 26,401\nTotal identifiable liabilities assumed 55,264\nNet identifiable assets acquired 115,071\nGoodwill 304,026\nNet assets acquired $ 419,097\nGoodwill represents the value of the assembled workforce and the enhanced knowledge, capabilities, and qualifications held by the business. This goodwill balance is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe intangible assets acquired represent customer relationships. We estimated this balance using the excess earnings method (which is a Level 3 measurement within the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy) and used a number of estimates, including expected future revenue and earnings from the acquired business and an appropriate expected rate of return. We have assumed a useful economic life of 10 years, representing our expectation of the period over which we will receive the benefit.\nAidvantage\nOn October 6, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the student loan servicing business from Navient, rebranded as Aidvantage. This business is a part of our U.S. Federal Services Segment and supplements our existing portfolio of services to the U.S. Department of Education.\nThe purchase price consideration is contingent upon future volumes, with a maximum payment of $65.0 million. The final payment is uncertain as there are a number of potential outcomes. We estimated the fair value of this liability, based upon a probability weighted assessment of the potential outcomes, of $18.5 million. We update this liability each quarter as changes are made to our estimate of fair value. These changes are recorded through our statement of operations. If our obligation is less than anticipated, this will result in a benefit to our earnings. The obligation may be higher, either because the number of student loans we are servicing increases or if the contractual relationship we have acquired is extended beyond its current anticipated end date of December 31, 2023. In that instance, we would record an expense to earnings which we would anticipate being offset by additional benefits from the contract. However, the timing of the adjustment to the obligation and the anticipated financial benefits would be unlikely to be consistent.\nWe recorded a single intangible asset related to the customer contract and relationship of $16.7 million, which we are amortizing over 27 months. The goodwill balance, representing the difference between the identifiable assets acquired and the estimated obligation, represents the assembled workforce, as well as the knowledge base acquired.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we reported $184.3 million and $28.3 million of revenue and gross profit, respectively, from Aidvantage. Since acquisition, we have adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration liability each quarter to reflect payments of $1.4 million, interest of $0.3 million, and changes to fair value of $3.6 million, principally related to the decline in our anticipated obligation to the seller. Changes to the fair value of the obligation are recorded in our selling, general and administrative expenses and other expense. At September 30, 2022, our contingent consideration liability is $13.8 million.\nOther acquisitions\nStirling Institute of Australia Pty Ltd (\"Stirling\")\nOn June 1, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Stirling for an estimated purchase price of $4.1 million (A$5.7 million Australian Dollars). Stirling provides vocational training to Australians seeking to improve their knowledge and qualifications. We acquired this business to complement our existing employment services. The business was integrated into our Outside the U.S. Segment. We are in the process of finalizing the allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We recorded estimated goodwill and intangible assets of $2.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively, related to the acquisition. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we reported revenue of $1.3 million and gross profit of $0.7 million, respectively, from Stirling.\nBZ Bodies Limited (\"BZB\")\nOn January 31, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of BZB for a purchase price of $2.5 million (\u00a31.9 million British Pounds), which includes an estimate of contingent consideration payable upon future performance. BZB provides weight management services for adults, children, and vulnerable groups in the United Kingdom. We acquired this business to complement our services within the United Kingdom. The business was integrated into our Outside the U.S. Segment. We recorded estimated goodwill and intangible assets of $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the acquisition. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we reported revenue of $3.9 million and $1.8 million gross profit, respectively, from BZB.\nConnect Assist Holdings Limited (\"Connect Assist\")\nOn September 14, 2021, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Connect Assist Holdings Limited (\"Connect Assist\") for a purchase price of $20.8 million (\u00a315.5 million British Pounds). We acquired this business to improve our contact center services and qualifications within the United Kingdom. The business was integrated into our Outside the U.S. Segment. We recorded goodwill and intangible assets of $11.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively, related to the acquisition.\nIndex Root Korea Co. Ltd (\"Index Root\")\nOn August 21, 2020, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Index Root Korea Co. Ltd (\"Index Root\") for a purchase price of $5.4 million (\u20a96.30 billion South Korean Won), which included acquisition-related contingent consideration estimated at $0.9 million (\u20a91.10 billion South Korean Won) based upon future earnings. We acquired Index Root to expand our geographic presence to South Korea. The business was integrated into our Outside the U.S. Segment. We recorded goodwill and intangible assets of $5.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively, related to the acquisition. During fiscal year 2021, we concluded that payment of the contingent consideration was unlikely and, accordingly, a benefit of $1.0 million was recorded within our acquisition expenses.\nInjuryNet Australia Pty Limited (\"InjuryNet\")\nOn February 28, 2020, we acquired 100% of the share capital of InjuryNet Australia Pty Limited (\"InjuryNet\") for a purchase price of $4.4 million (A$6.7 million Australian Dollars), which included acquisition-related contingent consideration of $2.1 million (A$3.1 million Australian Dollars) based upon future earnings. The contingent consideration was paid in full during fiscal year 2021. InjuryNet provides workplace medical services in Australia. The business was integrated into our Outside the U.S. Segment. We recorded goodwill and intangible assets of $2.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively, related to the acquisition.\n7.

The Credit Agreement provided for the following three components.\n$1.10 billion term loan facility (\"Term Loan A\"), which matures on May 28, 2026;\n$400.0 million term loan facility (\"Term Loan B\"), which matures May 28, 2028;\n$600.0 million revolving credit facility (\"Revolver\"), which matures May 28, 2026.\nThe interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Agreement are floating rates based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus a margin. Term Loan A and the Revolver margins range between 1% and 2%, based upon our leverage ratio. Term Loan B is set to LIBOR plus 2.00% subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.50%. LIBOR is being phased out, and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") has been identified as an alternative benchmark rate in this agreement. We anticipate transferring to SOFR during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. As of September 30, 2022, the annual effective interest rate, including the original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs, was 4.69%.\nThe Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including the funding of working capital, capital expenditures, and possible future acquisitions. In addition to borrowings, it allows us to continue to issue letters of credit when necessary.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain covenants, the terms of which are customary and include a net total leverage ratio and a net interest coverage ratio. The net total leverage ratio is calculated as total outstanding debt and contingent consideration liabilities less the lower of (a) unrestricted cash or (b) $75.0 million. With certain exceptions, the covenant requires the net total leverage ratio, as defined by the Credit Agreement to be less than 4.0, calculated over the previous twelve months. The net interest coverage ratio is calculated as EBITDA divided by interest expense, over the previous twelve months, all defined by the Credit Agreement. The covenant requires a net interest coverage ratio of 3.0 or greater. As of September 30, 2022, as defined by the Credit Agreement, the company calculated a net total leverage ratio of 2.6 and net interest coverage ratio of 11.0. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2022. We do not believe that the covenants represent a significant restriction to our ability to successfully operate the business or to pay our dividends.\nCosts incurred in establishing the Credit Agreement have been reported as a reduction to the gross debt balance and will be amortized over the respective lives of the arrangements.\nIn addition to the corporate Credit Agreement, we hold smaller credit facilities in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. These allow our businesses to borrow to meet any short-term working capital needs.\nTable 8.2: Details of Future Minimum Principal Payments Due\nAmount Due\n(in thousands)\nYear ended September 30, 2023 $ 65,939\nYear ended September 30, 2024 86,500\nYear ended September 30, 2025 93,375\nYear ended September 30, 2026 741,500\nYear ended September 30, 2027 4,000\nThereafter 375,000\nTotal Payments $ 1,366,314\nInterest Rate Derivative Instrument\nIn June 2021, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $300.0 million, effective June 28, 2021, with an expiration date of May 28, 2026, which hedges the floating LIBOR on a portion of the Term Loan A under the Credit Agreement to a fixed rate of 0.986%. The Company elected to designate this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had a net asset of $31.4 million, which was recorded in \"other assets\" on our consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, we had a liability of $0.4 million, which was recorded in \"other liabilities\" on our consolidated balance sheet. As this cash flow hedge is considered effective, all gains and losses are reflected within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nTable 8.3: Gains/(Losses) on Derivatives\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nGain/(loss) recognized in AOCI on derivatives, net of tax $ 23,004 $ (811) $ -\nAmounts reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 447 508 -\nNet current period other comprehensive income $ 23,451 $ (303) $ -\nIn October 2022, we entered into another interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $200.0 million, also hedging the floating LIBOR rate on a portion of the Term Loan A. This has been designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. Both interest rate swap agreements include provisions to allow for an orderly transition to SOFR in coordination with the change in the Term Loan A.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to our derivative instrument. Our counterparty has investment-grade credit ratings; accordingly, we anticipate that the counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligations under the contracts. Our agreements outline the conditions upon which it or the counterparty are required to post collateral. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there was no collateral posted with its counterparty related to the derivatives.\n9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe had two assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2022; the deferred compensation asset related to investments in mutual funds, and the interest rate swap. For the deferred compensation asset, the mutual funds prices are quoted in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 1. For the interest rate swap, we obtain its Level 2 pricing inputs from its counterparty for the interest rate swap. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. As of September 30, 2022, we had liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis for contingent consideration related to acquisitions. The contingent consideration liability is considered Level 3, as the inputs are not observable and based on internal assumptions about forecasted revenues, margins, volumes, and probability of contract extensions on businesses acquired.\nThe fair values of receivables, prepaid assets, other assets, accounts payable, accrued costs, and other current liabilities approximate the carrying values as a result of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of our debt is consistent with the fair value as the stated interest rates in the agreements are consistent with the current market rates used in notes with similar terms in the markets (Level 2 inputs).\nOther long-lived assets are reviewed when events indicate they may no longer be able to recover their value. Assets that we cease using or which do not appear able to generate sufficient future cash flows to support their values are reviewed and, where necessary, their value is written down. In this instance, the expense is reported in the same place where future expenses were anticipated to be recorded. For example, a fixed asset impairment would be recorded in depreciation expense. All the non-recurring fair values are considered Level 3, as the inputs are not observable and based on internal assumptions. During the years ending, September 30, 2021, and 2020, we recorded impairment charges of, $12.5 million, and $1.2 million on long-lived assets within our U.S. Services and Outside the U.S. Services Segments relating to underperforming contracts. We did not record impairment charges in the year ended September 30, 2022.\nTable 9.1: Fair Value Measurements\nAs of September 30, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Balance\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nDeferred compensation assets - Rabbi Trust $ 22,769 $ - $ - $ 22,769\nInterest rate swap - 31,409 - 31,409\nTotal assets $ 22,769 $ 31,409 $ - $ 54,178\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration $ - $ - $ 16,236 $ 16,236\nTotal liabilities $ - $ - $ 16,236 $ 16,236\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the contingent consideration which is measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs:\nTable 9.2: Fair Value Measurement Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nContingent Consideration\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of September 30, 2021 $ 270\nContingent consideration from current year acquisitions\n20,967\nAdjustments to fair value recorded in the current year\n(3,153)\nPayments (1,395)\nForeign currency translations (453)\nBalance as of September 30, 2022 $ 16,236\n10.

New or amended leases resulted in additional right-of-use assets of $43.5 million and $60.2 million for the same periods, respectively.\n11.

Accordingly, our presentation of deferred taxes on our consolidated balance sheets is split between jurisdictions that show a net deferred tax asset and a net deferred tax liability.\nTable 11.5: Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities By Jurisdiction Positions\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nTotal of tax jurisdictions with net deferred tax assets $ 4,970 $ 990\nTotal of tax jurisdictions with net deferred tax liabilities (206,099) (194,638)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (201,129) $ (193,648)\nWe consider our foreign earnings in excess of the earnings subject to the one-time transition tax to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. Accordingly, no U.S. deferred taxes were recorded with respect to such earnings. As of September 30, 2022, our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $37.2 million of cash and cash equivalents in either U.S. Dollars or local currencies.\nThe provision for income taxes includes all provision to return adjustments included in the year recognized in the financial statements.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is \"more-likely-than-not\" that the position will be sustained upon examination. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our annual effective income tax rate was $7.3 million and $12.6 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe report interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We recognized interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits of $0.1 million for each of the years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, with no comparative amounts in fiscal year 2022. The net liability balance at September 30, 2021, includes approximately $2.1 million and less than $0.1 million of interest and penalties, respectively, with no comparative amounts at September 30, 2022.\nWe recognize and present uncertain tax positions on a gross basis (i.e., without regard to likely offsets for deferred tax assets, deductions and/or credits that would result from payment of uncertain tax amounts).\nTable 11.6: Reconciliation of the Beginning and Ending Amounts of Potential Tax Benefits\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of year $ 12,642 $ 1,798 $ 3,001\nAdditions for acquired unrecognized tax benefits - 11,244 -\nDecreases for lapse of statue of limitations (1,412) - -\nDecreases for settlements with taxing authorities (4,785) - -\nIncreases for tax positions taken in current year 2,231 300 770\nDecreases for tax positions taken in current year - (700) (1,973)\nBalance at end of year $ 8,676 $ 12,642 $ 1,798\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to federal income tax examinations for years before 2019 and to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. In international jurisdictions, similar rules apply to filed income tax returns, although the tax examination limitations and requirements may vary. We are no longer subject to audit by tax authorities for foreign jurisdictions for years prior to 2018.\n12. EQUITY\nStock Compensation\nWe grant restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units (\"PSUs\") to eligible participants under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which was approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders. The RSUs granted to employees vest ratably over three to five years and one year for members of the board of directors, in each case from the grant date. PSU vesting is subject to the achievement of certain performance and market conditions and the number of PSUs earned could vary from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs awarded. The PSUs will vest at the end of a three year-performance period. We issue new shares to satisfy our obligations under these plans. The fair value of each RSU and PSU is calculated at the date of the grant.\nTable 12.1: Restricted Stock Units and Performance Based Stock Units\nRestricted Stock Units Performance Stock Units Total Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\nNon-vested outstanding units as of September 30, 2021 630,443 85,004 715,447 $ 74.06\nGranted 361,606 103,640 465,246 79.75\nCancelled/Forfeited (49,793) (329) (50,122) 81.10\nVested (389,613) - (389,613) 74.20\nNon-vested outstanding units as of September 30, 2022 552,643 188,315 740,958 77.08\nIn addition to the non-vested shares, as part of individual elections made in the deferred compensation plan, certain directors and employees held approximately 276,000 vested but not issued awards as of September 30, 2022. These vested unissued units are included in outstanding shares for basic and diluted earnings per share, but are not reported as issued and outstanding in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the intrinsic value of RSUs and PSUs expected to vest was $38.4 million.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized share-based compensation expenses of $30.5 million, $28.6 million, and $23.7 million, respectively. The income tax benefit recorded on these charges for the same years was $6.9 million, $13.5 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. The expenses related to share-based compensation awards are recorded in selling and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2022, there was $47.2 million of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and PSUs. This cost is expected to be recognized over four years.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted in years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, was $76.80 and $74.26, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $23.5 million, $28.9 million, and $23.6 million, respectively.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nUnder a resolution adopted in March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase, at management's discretion, of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company purchased 1.4 million, 0.1 million, and 2.8 million common shares at a cost of $96.1 million, $3.4 million, and $167.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, $50.6 million remained available for future stock repurchases.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nAll amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are related to the our foreign currency translations and interest rate swap, net of tax.

At September 30, 2022, this balance includes $60.7 million of funds received from a customer which had previously been sold under our Receivables Purchase Agreement; this is offset by a corresponding liability in within \"Other current liabilities\". The majority of the remaining balance are funds held in trust on behalf of certain clients; this asset is similarly offset with a corresponding liability in \"Other current liabilities\".\nTable 13.2: Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nInterest payments $ 43,094 $ 14,539 $ 1,600\nIncome tax payments $ 76,038 $ 99,899 $ 89,100\n14.

In return for these sales, we receive a cash payment equal to the face value of the receivables less a financing charge. The effective interest rate under this program was 4.08%.\nWe account for these transfers as sales. We have no retained interest in the transferred receivables other than administrative responsibilities, and Wells Fargo has no recourse for any credit risk. We estimate that the implicit servicing fees for an arrangement of this size and type would be immaterial.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the fair value of accounts receivables transferred to Wells Fargo and derecognized from our balance sheet was $74.2 million. In exchange for these sales, we received $73.9 million of cash. The balance, representing a loss on sale from these transfers, is included within our selling, general and administrative expenses. We have recorded these transactions within our operating cash flows.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nTable 14.3: Details of Property and Equipment, Net\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nLand $ - $ 1,738\nBuilding and improvements - 11,981\nOffice furniture and equipment 209,258 254,102\nLeasehold improvements 78,727 79,938\nProperty and equipment, at cost 287,985 347,759\nAccumulated depreciation (235,727) (285,132)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 52,258 $ 62,627\nDepreciation expense for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, was $28.3 million, $34.1 million, and $54.9 million, respectively. This expense was recorded within \"cost of revenue\" and \"selling, general, and administrative expenses\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn August 2022, we sold the land and buildings which held our corporate headquarters resulting in a gain on sale of $11.0 million.\nCapitalized Software Costs, Net\nCapitalized software is recorded at cost and includes purchased, internally-developed and externally-developed software used in our operations. Amortization expense is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software.\nA summary of activities related to capitalized software costs is shown below:\nTable 14.4: Details of Capitalized Software, Net\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCapitalized software $ 161,353 $ 139,145\nAccumulated amortization (102,613) (96,277)\nCapitalized software, net $ 58,740 $ 42,868\nAmortization expense related to capitalized software for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $14.1 million, $12.3 million, and $9.6 million, respectively. The majority of this amortization was recorded within our \"cost of revenue\" and \"selling, general, and administrative expenses\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe amortization totals above include $2.4 million, and $0.6 million of costs which were capitalized and subsequently written off during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with no comparable amounts for the year ended September 30, 2022. These costs were related to contracts that were deemed unrecoverable. This expense was recorded within \"cost of revenue\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nDeferred Contract Costs, Net\nDeferred contract costs consist of contractually recoverable costs to fulfill related to long-term service contracts. These costs include direct and incremental costs incurred prior to the commencement of providing service to our customer. These costs are expensed over the period the services are provided using the straight-line method.\nA summary of activities related to deferred contract costs is shown below:\nTable 14.5: Details of Deferred Contracts Costs, Net\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nDeferred contract costs $ 76,498 $ 67,209\nAccumulated amortization (28,766) (30,723)\nTotal deferred contract costs, net $ 47,732 $ 36,486\nAmortization expense related to deferred contract costs for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $8.9 million, $13.6 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. These amounts were recorded within our \"cost of revenue\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe amortization totals above includes $4.4 million, and $0.6 million of costs which were written off during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with no comparable amounts for the year ended September 30, 2022. These costs were related to contracts in our U.S. Services and Outside the U.S. segments and are deemed unrecoverable. This expense was recorded within \"cost of revenue\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPerformance Bonds\nCertain contracts require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of performance. As of September 30, 2022, we had performance bond commitments totaling $19.0 million. These bonds are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to audits, investigations, and reviews relating to compliance with the laws and regulations that govern our role as a contractor to agencies and departments of federal, state, local, and foreign governments, and otherwise in connection with performing services in countries outside of the U.S. Adverse findings could lead to criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings, and we could be faced with penalties, fines, suspension, or debarment. Adverse findings could also have a material adverse effect on us because of our reliance on government contracts. We are subject to periodic audits by federal, state, local, and foreign governments for taxes. We are also involved in various claims, arbitrations, and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of our business. These include but are not limited to bid protests, employment matters, contractual disputes, and charges before administrative agencies. Although we can give no assurance, based upon our evaluation and taking into account the advice of legal counsel, we do not believe that the outcome of any existing matter would likely have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our litigation matters and establish or make adjustments to our accruals as appropriate. A liability is accrued if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the outcome of litigation, our estimates and assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and could be impacted by unanticipated events and circumstances, adverse outcomes or other future determinations.\nArizona Medicaid claims\nFrom 2004 through 2009, we had a contract with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) in support of the states school-based Medicaid claims. We entered into separate agreements with the local school districts under which we assisted the districts with preparing and submitting claims to AHCCCS which, in turn, submitted claims for reimbursement to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\nCMS subsequently asserted two disallowances against AHCCCS. AHCCCS contested the first disallowance and ultimately settled that claim with CMS. The second disallowance of approximately $19.9 million is still being contested by AHCCCS in court. AHCCCS previously had asserted that its agreement with us requires us to reimburse AHCCCS for the amounts owed to CMS and, on October 18, 2022, AHCCCS sued Maximus pertaining to the first disallowance - Snyder v. Maximus, Case No. CV2022-053302, Superior Court for the County of Maricopa. AHCCCS is seeking damages from us of $5.4 million. Also, AHCCCS previously indicated its intention to seek reimbursement from us for the second disallowance if its court challenge is unsuccessful.\nOur agreements with the school districts require them to reimburse us for such amounts, and therefore we believe the school districts are responsible for any amounts that ultimately must be refunded to CMS beyond the fees we were paid. Although we believe we have valid defenses to the claims asserted, we have accrued a contingent liability based upon our best estimate of the potential outcome. We exited the federal healthcare-claiming business in 2009 and no longer provide the services at issue in this matter.\n16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have 401(k) plans for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The plans provide for company match, specified company contributions and discretionary company contributions. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we contributed $28.0 million, $17.3 million, and $13.2 million to the 401(k) plans, respectively. Outside the U.S., we have a number of defined contribution pension plans and other employee benefit plans. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we contributed $23.7 million, $22.8 million, and $18.6 million to these plans, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe also have a deferred compensation plan, which is a non-qualified plan available to a restricted number of highly compensated employees. The plan enables participants to defer compensation for tax purposes. These deferred employee contributions are held within a Rabbi Trust with investments directed by the respective employees. The assets of the Rabbi Trust are available to satisfy the claims of general creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The assets of the plan are sufficient to meet 86% of the liabilities as of September 30, 2022. The assets within the Rabbi Trust include $22.8 million invested in mutual funds that have quoted prices in active markets. These assets, as well as the related employee liabilities, are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\n17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nOn October 7, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 for each share of our common stock outstanding. The dividend is payable on November 30, 2022, to shareholders of record on November 15, 2022. Based upon the number of shares outstanding, we anticipate a cash payment of approximately $17.0 million. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we believe that as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nThe attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, issued by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements, is included following this Item 9A.\nIn October 2021, we acquired the student loan servicing business from Navient, rebranded as Aidvantage. At September 30, 2022, Aidvantage represented less than 1% and 1% of total and net assets, respectively, excluding the value of goodwill and intangible assets related to Aidvantage. Aidvantage contributed 4% and 3% of revenue and gross profit, respectively, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. As permitted by the SEC, we excluded Aidvantage from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting at September 30, 2022.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Maximus, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Maximus, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Maximus, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Aidvantage, which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than 1% and 1% of total and net assets, respectively, excluding the value of goodwill and intangible assets related to Aidvantage, as of September 30, 2022 and 4% and 3% of revenue and gross profit, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Aidvantage.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated November 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nNovember 22, 2022 Item 9B.
